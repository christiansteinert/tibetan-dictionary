Changelog:

Version 0.0.11:
* added a possibility mode to search for English terms and get Tibetan equivalents. The English-Tibetan entries are generated from some of the Tibetan-English dictionaries that are already included in the program. In order to get more detail on a term it is best to first enter an English term to search for a Tibetan word and then click on one of the possible Tibetan translations to get more detail for this Tibetan term. Not all dictionaries can be used for the English-Tibetan search and results and there may be some strange English entries, since the original dictionaries where not intended to be used for opposite in the opposite direction but it should nevertheless be quite useful.
* Added new dictionary: Glossary from the 84000 translation project
* Added an additional older version of Jefrey Hopkins' Tibetan-Sanskrit dictionary from 1992 because in the newer version from 2015 some Sanskrit entries are cut off
* Corrected problems in Rangjung Yeshe dictionary data that prevented a result from being shown. Only very few terms were affected by this.

Version 0.0.10:
* Added new dictionary: Tsepak Rigdzin - Tibetan-English Dictionary of Buddhist Terms
* Fine tuning for Tibetan input:
** an additional input mode is available via the settings where the input always remains in Wylie transliteration whereas all other Tibetan text is shown in Tibetan script. 
** The input field does not get cleared anymore when clicking on it - instead there is an additional button to clear the input if desired.
** Pressing Enter will remove the cursor from the input field which causes the on screen keyboard to be hidden on mobile devices
* some very minor fixes of dictionary formatting

Version 0.0.9:
* Try to convince the Google Play Store that this App works just as well on tablets as it does on phones.

Version 0.0.8:
* Layout fix: reduce horizontal scrolling in the about-section
* new verb dictionary added: "Verbinator" Tibetan Verb Dictionary (Verbinator 2000). Taken from: Hill, Nathan (2010) "A Lexicon of Tibetan Verb Stems as Reported by the Grammatical Tradition" (Munich: Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften).
* new glossary added - Tibetan and English terms from: "Buddhist Terms - Multilingual Version", Edited by Peter GÃ¤ng and Sylvia Wetzel, Buddhist Academy Berlin Brandenburg (June 2004)

Version 0.0.7:
* initial checkin on Github (including some cleanup of the build process)
* New glossary added: "Common Chinese-Tibetan-Sanskrit-English Buddhist Terminology", Compiled by Chung-An Lin, assisted by Hou-Wha Wang (only the English and Tibetan terminology is incluced in the application so far). Thanks to the author for allowing this material to be added!
* New dictionary added: dung-dkar-tshig-mdzod-chen-mo
* Dictionary removed: bod-rgya tshig-mdzod chen-mo (Sorry, I cannnot include this dictionary for now. I will look if there is a way to add it again in the future).
