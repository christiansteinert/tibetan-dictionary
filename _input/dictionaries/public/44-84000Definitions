To understand Buddhist teaching correctly, we must be clear about the two senses (conventional/ultimate, or relative/absolute), since mistaking denial of ultimate self as denial of conventional self leads to nihilism, and mistaking affirmation of conventional self as affirmation of ultimate self leads to absolutism. Nihilism and absolutism effectively prevent us from realizing our enlightenment, hence are to be avoided.

snyom 'jug|“Absorption” has been translated as “meditation,” “contemplation,” “attainment,” etc., and any of these words might serve. The problem is to establish one English word for each of the important Sanskrit words samāpatti, dhyāna, samādhi, bhāvanā, etc., so as to preserve a consistency with the original. Therefore, I have adopted for these terms, respectively, “absorption,” “contemplation,” “concentration” and “realization” or “cultivation,” reserving the word “meditation” for general use with any of the terms when they are used not in a specific sense but to indicate mind-practice in general.

lung|The Mūlasarvāstivādin tradition grouped the Buddha’s early sūtra discourses into four divisions, or Āgama (Tib. mdo sde’i lung sde bzhi ): the Dīrghāgama (Tib. lung ring po ), the Madhyamāgama (Tib. lung bar ma ), the Ekottarikāgama (Tib. lung gcig las ’phros pa ), and the Saṃyuktāgama (Tib. lung dag ldan / yang dar par ldan pa’i lung ). They are more familiar to many English-speaking Buddhists through the translations of their Pali correlates: the Dīgha Nikāya, Majjhima Nikāya, Aṅguttara Nikāya, and the Samyutta Nikāya, for which see the Wisdom Publications titles: The Long Discourses of the Buddha, The Middle-Length Discourses of the Buddha, The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, and The Connected Discourses of the Buddha, respectively.

phung po|This translation of skandha is fairly well established, although some prefer the monosyllabic “group.” It is important to bear in mind that the original skandha has the sense of “pile,” or “heap,” which has the connotation of utter lack of internal structure, of a randomly collocated pile of things; thus “group” may convey a false connotation of structure and ordered arrangement. The five “compulsive” (upādāna) aggregates are of great importance as a schema for introspective meditation in the Abhidharma, wherein each is defined with the greatest subtlety and precision. In fact, the five terms rūpa, vedanā, samjñā, saṃskāra, and vijñāna have such a particular technical sense that many translators have preferred to leave them untranslated. Nevertheless, in the sūtra context, where the five are meant rather more simply to represent the relative living being (in the realm of desire), it seems preferable to give a translation—in spite of the drawbacks of each possible term—in order to convey the same sense of a total categorization of the psychophysical complex. Thus, for rūpa, “matter” is preferred to “form” because it more concretely connotes the physical and gross; for vedanā, “sensation” is adopted, as limited to the aesthetic; for samjñā, “intellect” is useful in conveying the sense of verbal, conceptual intelligence. For samskāra, which covers a number of mental functions as well as inanimate forces, “motivation” gives a general idea. And “consciousness” is so well established for vijñāna (although what we normally think of as consciousness is more like samjñā, i.e., conceptual and notional, and vijñāna is rather the “pure awareness” prior to concepts) as to be left unchallenged.

grangs med pa|This eon is literally called “incalculable” but nevertheless has a calculated span of time and therefore, to avoid confusion, its Sanskrit name is used here. The number of years in an asaṃkhyeya eon differs in various sūtras. Twenty “intermediate eons” are said to be one asaṃkhyeya eon, and four asaṃkhyeya eons are one great eon (mahākalpa). In that case those four asaṃkhyeya eons represent the eons of the creation, presence, destruction, and absence of a world. Therefore buddhas are often described as appearing in a second asaṃkhyeya eon.

In “The lord of Avalokita,” Avalokita has been interpreted as “seeing,” although, as a past passive participle, it is literally “lord of what has been seen.” One of the principal sūtras in the Mahāsamghika tradition was the Avalokita Sūtra, which has not been translated into Tibetan, in which the word is a synonym for enlightenment, as it is “that which has been seen” by the buddhas. In the early tantras, he is one of the lords of the three families, as the embodiment of the compassion of the buddhas. The Potalaka Mountain in southern India became important in Southern Indian Buddhism as his residence in this world, but Potalaka does not yet feature in the http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-051-004.html (Toh 116), which emphasized the preeminence of Avalokiteśvara above all buddhas and bodhisattvas and introduced the mantra oṃ maṇipadme hūṃ.

rig pa|This term may generally by synonymous with intelligence or mental aptitude, but it also conveys the meaning of science or branches of knowledge, and of pure awareness. In this last sense, it denotes the fundamental innate mind in its natural state of spontaneity and purity, beyond alternating states of motion and rest and the subject-object dichotomy.
bag yod pa|This denotes a type of awareness of the most seemingly insignificant aspects of practical life, an awareness derived as a consequence of the highest realization of the ultimate nature of reality. As it is stated in the Anavatapta­nāga­rāja­paripṛcchā­sūtra (Toh 156): “He who realizes voidness, that person is consciously aware.” “Ultimate realization,” far from obliterating the relative world, brings it into highly specific, albeit dreamlike, focus.

See Nordrang Orgyan (2008): 428.
skye mched|In Buddhism one way of describing experience (or being) is in terms of the twelve sense fields (eye and form, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, body and touch, mind and mental objects).
skye mched|One way of describing experience and the world in terms of twelve sense fields (eye and form, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, body and touch, mind and mental objects).
skye mched|The twelve sense-media are eye-medium (cakṣurāyatana), form-medium (rūpa-), ear-medium (śrotra-), sound-medium (śabda-), nose-medium (ghrāna-), scent-medium (gandha-), tongue-medium (jihvā-), taste-medium (rasa-), body-medium (kāya-), texture-medium (spraṣṭavya), mental-medium (mana-), and phenomena-medium (dharmāyatana). In some passages they are enumerated as six, the object-faculty pair being taken as one, and it is this set of six that is the fifth member of the twelve links of dependent origination. The word āyatana is usually translated as “base,” but the Skt., Tib., and Ch. all indicate “something through which the senses function” rather than a basis from which they function; hence “medium” is suggested.
skye mched|Sometimes translated “sense-fields” or “bases of cognition,” the term usually refers to the six sense faculties and their corresponding objects, i.e. the first twelve of the eighteen dhātu. Along with skandha and dhātu, one of the three major categories in the taxonomy of phenomena in the sūtra literature.

skye mched|The twelve bases of perception are divided into two groups, consisting of six inner and six outer bases. These are six sense faculties and six outer corresponding objects. Together they are the causes for the production of the six sense consciousnesses.
skye mched|The six “inner” sense organs (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, tactile sense, and mind), and their respective six “outer” objects of forms, sounds, smells, flavors, tactile objects, and mental objects, are sometimes called collectively the “six sense sources” (q.v.), but are also sometimes taken as two separate groups, making twelve.
skye mched|The subjective and objective polarities of sense perception.
skye mched|There are twelve bases of cognition in all: the five physical sense organs plus the mind and their respective six sorts of objects. The six inner bases from eye to mind are what apprehend; and the six outer bases from form to mental objects are the objects that are apprehended.

bakku la|From a wealthy brahmin family, Bakkula is said to have become a monk at the age of eighty and lived to be a hundred and sixty!

It is therefore likely that this word refers to the Indian flying squirrel, Petaurista philippensis.

bcom ldan 'das|“Lord” is chosen to translate the title Bhagavān because it is the term of greatest respect current in our “sacred” language, as established for the Deity in the Elizabethan version of the Bible. Indeed, the Skt. Bhagavān was given as a title to the Buddha, although it also served the non-Buddhist Indians of the day and, subsequently, it served as an honorific title of their particular deities. As the Buddha is clearly described in the sūtras as the “Supreme Teacher of Gods and Men,” there seems little danger that he may be confused with any particular deity through the use of this term [as indeed in Buddhist sūtras various deities, creators, protectors, etc., are shown in their respective roles]. Thus I feel it would compromise the weight and function of the original Bhagavān to use any less weighty term than “Lord” for the Buddha.

mi skye ba'i chos la bzod pa|Here we are concerned with the “intuitive tolerance of the birthlessness (or incomprehensibility) of all things” (anutpattika­dharma­kṣānti or anupalabdhi­dharma­kṣānti). To translate kṣānti as “knowledge” or “conviction” defeats entirely the Skt. usage and its intended sense: In the face of birthlessness or incomprehensibility (i.e., the ultimate reality), ordinary knowledge and especially convictions are utterly lost; this is because the mind loses objectifiability of anything and has nothing to grasp, and its process of coming to terms may be described only as a conscious cancellation through absolute negations of any false sense of certainty about anything. Through this tolerance, the mind reaches a stage where it can bear its lack of bearings, as it were, can endure this kind of extreme openness, this lack of any conviction, etc. There are three degrees of this tolerance—verbal (ghoṣānugā), conforming (anulomikī), and complete.

snying rje chen po|This refers to one of the two central qualities of buddhas or high bodhisattvas: their feeling born of the wish for all living beings to be free of suffering and to attain the supreme happiness. It is important to note that this great compassion has nothing to do with any sentimental emotion such as that stimulated by such a reflection as “Oh, the poor creatures! How they are suffering!” On the contrary, great compassion is accompanied by the clear awareness that ultimately there are no such things as living beings, suffering, etc., in reality. Thus it is a sensitivity that does not entertain any dualistic notion of subject and object; indeed, such an unlimited sensitivity might best be termed “empathy.”

ting nge 'dzin|A mind focused one-pointedly on an object of concentration.
ting nge 'dzin|A general term for the practice of meditative absorption aimed at developing profound states of concentration.
bsam gtan|Meditative concentration is defined as the one-pointed abiding in an undistracted state of mind free from afflicted mental states. It is an advanced form of calm abiding, where often both calm abiding and penetrative insight may be present in perfect union. Four states of meditative concentration are identified as being conducive to birth within the world system of form, each of which has three phases of intensity. However, in the context‌ of the Great Vehicle, meditative concentration is the fifth of the six transcendent perfections. See also “four meditative concentrations” and http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-170.

byang chub kyi sems bskyed pa|This can also be rendered by “initiation of…” because it means the mental event occurring when a living being, having been exposed to the teaching of the Buddha or of his magical emanations (e.g., Vimalakīrti), realizes simultaneously his own level of conditioned ignorance, i.e., that his habitual stream of consciousness is like sleep compared to that of one who has awakened from ignorance; the possibility of his own attainment of a higher state of consciousness; and the necessity of attaining it in order to liberate other living beings from their stupefaction. Having realized this possibility, he becomes inspired with the intense ambition to attain, and that is called the “conception of the spirit of enlightenment.” “Spirit” is preferred to “mind” because the mind of enlightenment should rather be the mind of the Buddha, and to “thought” because a “thought of enlightenment” can easily be produced without the initiation of any sort of new resolve or awareness. “Will” also serves very well here.\nconceiving the spirit of enlightenment\nconceive the spirit of enlightenment
spros pa|This term denotes the presence of discursive or conceptual thought processes. Their absence or deconstruction is characteristic of the realization of emptiness or actual reality.
rnam par rtog pa|Also translated here as “false imagination.”
rnam par rtog pa|This brings up another important group of words that has never been treated systematically in translation: vikalpa, parikalpa, samāropa, adhyāropa, kalpanā, samjñā, and prapāñca. All of these refer to mental functions that tend to superimpose upon reality, either relative or ultimate, a conceptualized reality fabricated by the subjective mind. Some translators have tended to lump these together under the rubric “discursive thought,” which leads to the misleading notion that all thought is bad, something to be eliminated, and that sheer “thoughtlessness” is “enlightenment,” or whatever higher state is desired. According to Buddhist scholars, thought in itself is simply a function, and only thought that is attached to its own content over and above the relative object, i.e., “egoistic” thought, is bad and to be eliminated. Therefore we have chosen a set of words for the seven Skt. terms: respectively, “conceptualization,” “imagination,” “presumption,” “exaggeration,” “construction,” “conception” or “notion,” and “fabrication.” This does not mean that these words are not somewhat interchangeable or that another English word might not be better in certain contexts; it only represents an attempt to achieve consistency with the original usages.
mtshan ma|Literally “signs,” or attributes.
spros pa|An etymologically obscure term, which can mean elaboration, diffusion, or expansion, but is basically describing the mind’s conceptualization, and is always connected to the words for notions and ideas, and mental fabrications.
mtshungs ldan|This denotes the five aspects of concomitance between mind and its mental states, which may concern (1) location or support ({gnas sam rten}), (2) objective referent ({dmigs pa}), (3) sensum ({rnam pa}), (4) time ({dus}), or (5) substance ({rdzas}).\n(See also note http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-1972).

bag yod pa|This denotes a type of awareness of the most seemingly insignificant aspects of practical life, an awareness derived as a consequence of the highest realization of the ultimate nature of reality. As it is stated in the Anavatapta­nāga­rāja­paripṛcchā­sūtra (Toh 156): “He who realizes voidness, that person is consciously aware.” “Ultimate realization,” far from obliterating the relative world, brings it into highly specific, albeit dreamlike, focus.
rnam shes|See “aggregate.”
rnam par shes pa|Third of the twelve links of dependent origination. Consciousness is defined as “an awareness which is knowing and luminous.” Not being physical, it lacks resistance to obstruction. It has neither shape nor color, and it can be experienced but not externally perceived as an object. A distinction is made between the mundane consciousness of sentient beings, and the pristine cognition of the buddhas. In the context‌ of the present discourse, the former includes six aspects of consciousness, namely, visual consciousness, auditory consciousness, olfactory consciousness, tactile consciousness, and mental consciousness, the last of which objectively refers to mental phenomena.
rnam par shes pa|The fifth of the five aggregates; also counted as the sixth of the six elements. In most Abhidharma accounts it comprises the six sensory consciousnesses, but in Yogācāra theory two more kinds of consciousness, afflicted (kliṣṭamanas) and storehouse (ālayavijñāna), are added. The term “consciousness” in this sūtra should not be assumed to conform fully to these classic categorizations.
lce'i rnam par shes pa'i khams|Twelfth of the eighteen sensory elements.\ngustatory consciousness
yid kyi rnam par shes pa|The Abhidharma speaks of five consciousnesses that grasp physical objects (form, sound, smells, tastes, bodily sensations) and are correlated with their respective physical sense faculties (indriya, {dbang po}), i.e. the eye, ear, etc. The mental consciousness, on the other hand, is said to have as its faculty simply the mind (manas, {yid}). It grasps all that exists, including what is presented by the physical consciousnesses as well as mental and abstract objects. These six consciousnesses, added to the twelve bases of cognition, constitute the Abhidharma schema of eighteen domains or spheres (dhātu, {khams}).
rnam par shes pa la gnas pa bdun|This refers to the seven categories of living beings, as enumerated in the Abhi­dharma­kośa, III, v. 5-6a. The seven abodes of consciousness consist of beings who differ physically and intellectually; beings who differ physically but are similar intellectually; beings similar physically but who differ intellectually; beings similar physically and intellectually; and three types of immaterial beings (nānātvakāya­saṃjñāś ca nānākāyaika­saṃjñinaḥ / viparyayāc caikakāya­saṃjñāś cārūpiṇas trayaḥ // vijñāna­sthitayaḥ sapta…). According to Vasubandhu the first category consists of men, the six types of gods of the desire-realm, and the gods of the first realm of contemplation (brahma­vihāra) except those fallen from higher realms (prathamābhinivṛta); the second category consists of those fallen (prathamābhiniṛvṛta) gods who have different bodies but whose intellects are single-mindedly aware of the idea of being created by Brahmā; the third category consists of the gods of the second realm of contemplation—the abhāsvara (clear-light) gods, the parīṭṭābha (radiant) gods, and the apramāṇābha (immeasurably luminous) gods—who have similar luminous bodies but differ in their thoughts, which are bent on the experiences of pleasure and numbness; the fourth category consists of the śubhakṛtsna (pure-wholeness) gods, whose intellects are united in concentration on bliss; the fifth category consists of the immaterial beings who reside in the realm of infinite space; the sixth category consists of the immaterial beings who reside in the realm of infinite consciousness; and the seventh category consists of the immaterial beings who reside in the realm of nothingness. (See also Mvy, Nos. 2289-2295.)
rnam par shes pa'i gnas bdun|Seven categories that describe living beings in the higher realms, from humans up to the formless realm: 1) those different in body and different in perception; 2) those different in body and equal in perception; 3) those equal in body but different in perception; 4) those equal in body and equal in perception; 5) those reborn in the sphere of boundless space; 6) those reborn in the sphere of boundless consciousness; and 7) those reborn in the sphere of nothingness.

This is especially important in the context of the Mādhyamika doctrine, hence in the context of Vimalakīrti’s teachings, because he is constantly correcting the disciples and bodhisattvas who accept interpretable expressions of the Tathāgata as if they were definitive, thereby attaching themselves to them and adopting a one-sided approach.

In general, the processes of cyclic existence, through which the external world and the sentient beings within it revolve in a continuous cycle of suffering, propelled by the propensities of past actions and their interaction with afflicted mental states, originate dependent on the sequential unfolding of twelve links, commencing from fundamental ignorance and ending with birth, aging, and death (see http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-155–http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-156). It is only through deliberate reversal of these twelve links that one can succeed in bringing the whole cycle to an end.

chos kyi dbyings|The element, or nature, of ultimate reality.
chos kyi dbyings|This compound is actually metaphorical in sense, with (at least) two interpretations possible because of ambiguities in the word dhātu. Dhātu as in the expression kāmadhātu (desire-realm), may mean “realm”; or it may mean “element,” as in the eighteen elements (see entry), where it is explained as analogous to a mineral such as copper. Thus the realm of the Dharma is the dharmakāyā, the pure source and sphere of the Dharma. And the element of the Dharma is like a mine from which the verbal Dharma, the buddha-qualities, and the wisdoms of the arhats and bodhisattvas are culled. This is metaphorical, as Vimalakīrti would remind us, because the Dharma, the ultimate, is ultimately not a particular place; it is immanent in all places, being the actuality and ultimate condition of all things and being relatively no one thing except, like voidness, the supremely beneficent of concepts.
chos kyi dbyings|The "sphere of dharmas," a synonym for the nature of things.

khams|One way of describing experience and the world in terms of eighteen elements (eye, form, and eye consciousness; ear, sound, and ear consciousness; nose, odor, and nose consciousness; tongue, taste, and tongue consciousness; body, touch, and body consciousness; mind, mental objects, and mind consciousness).
khams|Depending on the context, may translate either: (a) Skt. mahābhūta, Tib. {'byung ba chen po}, the four “main” or “great” outer elements of earth, water, fire, air, and (when there is a fifth) space; or: (b) Skt. dhātu, Tib. khams, the “eighteen elements” introduce, in the context of the aggregates, elements, and sense-media, the same six pairs as the twelve sense-media, as elements of experience, adding a third member to each set: the element of consciousness (vijñāna), or sense. Hence the first pair gives the triad eye-element (caksur­dhātu), form-element (rūpadhātu), and eye-consciousness-element, or eye-sense-element (caksur­vijñāna­dhātu)—and so on with the other five, noting the last, mind-element (manodhātu), phenomena-element (dharma­dhātu), and mental-sense-element (mano­vijñāna­dhātu).

Mahāvyutpatti, 1127-39.
shes rab|Also translated here as “wisdom.” See glossary entry.
rtog pa|The ordinary activity of the mental consciousness, also translated as conceptual thought.
dben pa|This term usually has to do with a subjective state of ‘isolation,’ ‘separation,’ or ‘withdrawal,’ rather than a metaphysical idea. The Akṣayamatinirdeśa-sūtra contains a more or less parallel discussion of {dben pa nyid} in connection with diligence: “{de la 'jug pa gang zhe na gang dge ba'i rtsa ba thams cad rtsom pa'o/ gnas pa gang zhe na. gangs sems dben pa'o}.” Jens Braarvig translates this passage: “What then is activity? Undertaking all roots of good. What then is stillness? Aloofness of thought.” (Braarvig, vol. 1, pp. 175-76; vol. 2, p. 50.) Here {sems dben pa} is glossed in the Akṣayamatinirdeśaṭīkā (of Vasubandhu or perhaps Sthiramati) as: {sems dben pa ni mi dge ba spangs pa dang dge ba rtsom pa gang la yang mi rtog pa'o}. This can be translated as, “Disengagement of one’s thought is not thinking at all about giving up the non-virtuous and undertaking the virtuous.” In any case, the term viviktatā in this context and in the Akṣayamatinirdeśa does not seem to be about emptiness, but more about a type of aloof or disengaged diligence that does not conceptualize the virtues and non-virtues of the actions undertaken.

'jig tshogs la lta ba|This consists of twenty varieties of false notion, consisting basically of regarding the temporally impermanent and ultimately insubstantial as “I” or “mine.” The five compulsive aggregates are paired with the self, giving the twenty false notions. For example, the first four false notions are that (1) matter is the self, which is like its owner (rūpaṃ ātmā svāmivat); (2) the self possesses matter, like its ornament (rūpavañ ātmā alaņkāravat); (3) matter belongs to the self, like a slave (ātmīyaṃ rūpaṃ bhṛtyavat); and (4) the self dwells in matter as in a vessel (rūpe ātmā bhajanavat). The other four compulsive aggregates are paired with the self in the same four ways, giving sixteen more false notions concerning sensation, intellect, motivation, and consciousness, hypostatizing an impossible relationship with a nonexistent, permanent, substantial self.

stong pa nyid|This Skt. term is usually translated by “voidness” because that English word is more rarely used in other contexts than “emptiness” and does not refer to any sort of ultimate nothingness, as a thing-in-itself, or even as the thing-in-itself to end all things-in-themselves. It is a pure negation of the ultimate existence of anything or, in Buddhist terminology, the “emptiness with respect to personal and phenomenal selves,” or “with respect to identity,” or “with respect to intrinsic nature,” or “with respect to essential substance,” or “with respect to self-existence established by intrinsic identity,” or “with respect to ultimate truth-status,” etc. Thus emptiness is a concept descriptive of the ultimate reality through its pure negation of whatever may be supposed to be ultimately real. It is an absence, hence not existent in itself. It is synonymous therefore with “infinity,” “absolute,” etc.—themselves all negative terms, i.e., formed etymologically from a positive concept by adding a negative prefix (in + finite = not finite; ab + solute = not compounded, etc.). But, since our verbally conditioned mental functions are habituated to the connection of word and thing, we tend to hypostatize a “void,” analogous to “outer space,” a “vacuum,” etc., which we either shrink from as a nihilistic nothingness or become attached to as a liberative nothingness; this great mistake can be cured only by realizing the meaning of the “emptiness of emptiness,” which brings us to the tolerance of inconceivability (see “tolerance”).
stong pa nyid|In the Mahāyāna this is the term for how phenomena are devoid of any nature of their own. One of the three doorways to liberation along with the absence of aspiration and the absence of attributes.
stong pa nyid|Meditative concentration which realizes the non-self of persons and phenomena; the first of the three doors of liberation.
stong pa nyid|Emptiness denotes the ultimate nature of reality, the total absence of inherent existence and self-identity with respect to all phenomena. According to this view, all things and events are devoid of any independent, intrinsic reality that constitutes their essence. Nothing can be said to exist independently from the complex network of factors that gives rise to their origination, nor are phenomena independent of the cognitive processes and mental constructs that make up the conventional framework within which their identity and existence are posited. When all levels of conceptualization dissolve and when all forms of dichotomizing tendencies are quelled through deliberate meditative deconstruction of conceptual elaborations, the ultimate nature of reality will finally become manifest.

rigs|In the context‌ of the present text, this term denotes the heritage or family of bodhisattvas following the Great Vehicle.\nWhen refering a son or daughter enlightened heritage, the expressions kula­putra ({rigs kyi bu}) and kula­duhitā ({rigs kyi bu mo}) are terms of endearment with which a teacher may address his or her own students. See the definition in Zhang Yisun et al (1975): 2686. In the context‌ of the present sūtra, these terms therefore denote a male or female follower of the Great Vehicle, distinct from the adherents of the lesser vehicles. This may be suggested in the translation “children of enlightened heritage,” which other interpretative renderings, such as “son of a noble family” or “son of a good family,” would lack.
rigs kyi bu|A term of endearment, used by a teacher when addressing a male follower of the bodhisattva path.\nchild of the enlightened family
rigs kyi bu mo|A term of endearment, used by a teacher when adressing a female follower of the bodhisattva path.
byang chub|This word requires too much explanation for this glossary because, indeed, the whole sūtra—and the whole of Buddhist literature—is explanatory of only this. Here we simply mention the translation equivalent.
byang chub|The Sanskrit can mean knowledge, realization, waking, blossoming, etc., according to context. The Tibetan translates as “purified and accomplished.”
byang chub kyi phyogs kyi chos|See “thirty-seven aids to enlightenment”
byang chub kyi snying po|Haribhadra defines it as “a place used as a seat, where the maṇḍa, here ‘essence,’ of enlightenment is present.” See Lamotte, p. 198, n. 105. The main “seat of enlightenment” is the spot under the bo tree at Buddha Gaya, where the Buddha sat and attained unexcelled, perfect enlightenment. It is not to be confused with bodhimaṇḍala, “circle of enlightenment.”
byang chub kyi yan lag bdun|These are the factors of remembrance (smṛti), discrimination between teachings (dharma­pravicaya), effort (vīrya), joy (prīti), ecstasy (praśrabdhi), concentration (samādhi), and equanimity (upekṣā). These seven form a part of the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment.

snying rje chen po|This refers to one of the two central qualities of buddhas or high bodhisattvas: their feeling born of the wish for all living beings to be free of suffering and to attain the supreme happiness. It is important to note that this great compassion has nothing to do with any sentimental emotion such as that stimulated by such a reflection as “Oh, the poor creatures! How they are suffering!” On the contrary, great compassion is accompanied by the clear awareness that ultimately there are no such things as living beings, suffering, etc., in reality. Thus it is a sensitivity that does not entertain any dualistic notion of subject and object; indeed, such an unlimited sensitivity might best be termed “empathy.”
snying rje chen po|A specific state of mind resulting from the four abodes of Brahma and defined as the wish to liberate all beings from suffering.

byams pa chen po|In an effort to maintain distinctions between Buddhism and Christianity, translators have used all sorts of euphemisms for this basic term. Granted, it is not the everyday “love” that means “to like”; it is still the altruistic love that is the finest inspiration of Christ’s teaching, as well as of the Mahāyāna.

As the term “Great Vehicle” implies, the path followed by bodhisattvas is analogous to a large carriage which can transport a vast number of people to liberation, as compared to a smaller vehicle for the individual practitioner.

Anāthapiṇḍada, a wealthy patron of the Buddha, purchased the park, located outside Śrāvasti, at great cost, purportedly covering the ground with gold, and donated it to the saṅgha. It was there that the Buddha spent several rainy seasons and gave discourses there that were later recorded as sūtras. It was also the site for one of the first Buddhist monasteries.

It is therefore likely that this word refers to the Indian flying squirrel, Petaurista philippensis.

The first five are attained through dhyāna, and are sometimes described as worldly, as they can be attained to some extent by non-Buddhist yogis; while the sixth is supramundane and attained only by realization—by bodhisattvas, or according to some accounts only by buddhas.

rang bzhin|Svabhāva is usually rendered as “self-nature,” sometimes as “own-being,” both of which have a certain literal validity. However, neither artificial term has any evocative power for the reader who has no familiarity with the original, and a term must be found that the reader can immediately relate to his own world to fulfill the function the original word had in its world. In our world of identities (national, racial, religious, personal, sexual, etc.), “identity” is a part of our makeup; thus, when we are taught the ultimate absence of identity of all persons and things, it is easy to “identify” what is supposedly absent and hence to try to understand what that entails.\nidentities

However, unlike bodhisattvas they do not realize that the internal phenomena of consciousness too are without inherent existence.

Buddha Śākyamuni was also considered to be in this family line.

Hence it is significant that the realization of this nature is not couched in terms of understanding, or conviction, but in terms of tolerance (kṣānti, see “tolerance”), as the grasping mind cannot grasp its ultimate inability to grasp; it can only cultivate its tolerance of that inability.

brgya byin|More commonly known in the West as Indra, the deity that is called “lord of the devas” dwells on the summit of Mount Sumeru and wields the thunderbolt. The Tibetan translation is based on an etymology that śakra is an abbreviation of śata-kratu, one who has performed a hundred sacrifices. The highest vedic sacrifice was the horse sacrifice, and there is a tradition that he became the lord of the gods through performing them. Each world with a central Sumeru has a Śakra; therefore this sutra mentions them in the plural.

ka lan da ka'i gnas|A place where the Buddha often resided, within the Bamboo Grove (Veṇuvana) outside Rajagṛha that had been donated to him. The name is said to have arisen when, one day, King Bimbisāra fell asleep after a romantic liaison in the Bamboo Grove. While the king rested, his consort wandered off. A snake (the reincarnation of the park’s previous owner, who still resented the king’s acquisition of the park) approached with malign intentions. Through the king’s tremendous merit, a gathering of kalandaka—crows or other birds according to Tibetan renderings, but some Sanskrit and Pali sources suggest flying squirrels—miraculously appeared and began squawking. Their clamor alerted the king’s consort to the danger, who rushed back and hacked the snake to pieces, thereby saving the king’s life. King Bimbisāra then named the spot Kalandakanivāpa (“Kalandakas’ Feeding Place”), sometimes (though not in the Vinayavastu) given as Kalandakanivāsa (“Kalandakas’ Abode”) in their honor. The story is told in the Saṅghabhedavastu (Toh 1, ch.17, Degé Kangyur vol.4, F.77.b et seq.).

rnam par thar ba|This can include any method for liberation. The most commonly listed are the eight liberations: (1) form viewing form: the view of dependent origination and emptiness; (2) the formless viewing form: having seen internal emptiness, seeing the emptiness of external forms; (3) the view of the pleasant: seeing pleasant appearances as empty and contemplating the unpleasant; (4) seeing the emptiness of the formless meditation of infinite space; (5) seeing the emptiness of the formless meditation of infinite consciousness; (6) seeing the emptiness of the formless meditation of nothingness; (7) seeing the emptiness of the formless meditation of neither perception nor nonperception; and (8) seeing the emptiness of the state of cessation.

The most common list is of eight liberations: (1) form viewing form, the view of dependent origination and emptiness; (2) the formless viewing form, having seen internal emptiness, seeing the emptiness of external forms; (3) the view of the pleasant, seeing pleasant appearances as empty and contemplating the unpleasant; (4) seeing the emptiness of the formless meditation of infinite space; (5) seeing the emptiness of the formless meditation of infinite consciousness; (6) seeing the emptiness of the formless meditation of nothingness; (7) seeing the emptiness of the formless meditation of neither perception nor nonperception; (8) seeing the emptiness of the state of cessation.
rnam par thar pa brgyad|The first consists of the seeing of form by one who has form; the second consists of the seeing of external form by one with the concept of internal formlessness; the third consists of the physical realization of pleasant liberation and its successful consolidation; the fourth consists of the full entrance to the infinity of space through transcending all conceptions of matter, and the subsequent decline of conceptions of resistance and discredit of conceptions of diversity; the fifth consists of full entrance into the infinity of consciousness, having transcended the infinity of space; the sixth consists of the full entrance into the sphere of nothingness, having transcended the sphere of the infinity of conscious­ness; the seventh consists of the full entrance into the sphere of neither conscious­ness nor un­conscious­ness, having transcended the sphere of nothingness; the eighth consists of the perfect cessation of suffering, having transcended the sphere of neither conscious­ness nor un­conscious­ness. Thus the first three liberations form specific links to the ordinary perceptual world; the fourth to seventh are equivalent to the four absorptions; and the eighth represents the highest attainment.
thabs|This is the expression in action of the great compassion of the Buddha and the bodhisattvas—physical, verbal, and mental. It follows that one empathetically aware of the troubles of living beings would, for his very survival, devise the most potent and efficacious techniques possible to remove those troubles, and the troubles of living beings are removed effectively only when they reach liberation. “Art” was chosen over the usual “method” and “means” because it has a stronger connotation of efficacy in our technological world; also, in Buddhism, liberative art is identified with the extreme of power, energy, and efficacy, as symbolized in the vajra (adamantine scepter): The importance of this term is highlighted in this sūtra by the fact that Vimalakīrti himself is introduced in the chapter entitled “Inconceivable Skill in Liberative Art”; this indicates that he, as a function of the nirmāṇakāya (incarnation-body), just like the Buddha himself, is the very incarnation of liberative art, and every act of his life is therefore a technique for the development and liberation of living beings. The “liberative” part of the translation follows “salvifique” in Lamotte’s phrase “moyens salvifique.”

rten 'brel gyi yan lag bcu gnyis|The principle of dependent origination asserts that nothing exists independently of other factors, the reason for this being that things and events come into existence only by dependence on the aggregation of multiple causes and conditions. In general, the processes of cyclic existence, through which the external world and the sentient beings within it revolve in a continuous cycle of suffering, propelled by the propensities of past actions and their interaction with afflicted mental states, originate dependent on the sequential unfolding of twelve links, commencing from fundamental ignorance and ending with birth, aging, and death (see http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-155–http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-156).

bcom ldan 'das|“Lord” is chosen to translate the title Bhagavān because it is the term of greatest respect current in our “sacred” language, as established for the Deity in the Elizabethan version of the Bible. Indeed, the Skt. Bhagavān was given as a title to the Buddha, although it also served the non-Buddhist Indians of the day and, subsequently, it served as an honorific title of their particular deities. As the Buddha is clearly described in the sūtras as the “Supreme Teacher of Gods and Men,” there seems little danger that he may be confused with any particular deity through the use of this term [as indeed in Buddhist sūtras various deities, creators, protectors, etc., are shown in their respective roles]. Thus I feel it would compromise the weight and function of the original Bhagavān to use any less weighty term than “Lord” for the Buddha.
bcom ldan 'das|Epithet of Buddha Śākyamuni.\nAccording to Tibetan hermeneutics, the term defines a teacher or buddha who primordially subdues ({bcom}) the four demonic forces, possesses ({ldan}) the six attributes of greatness ({che ba'i yon tan drug}, viz: lordship, noble form, glory, fame, pristine cognition, and perseverance), and transcends ({'das}) all sorrow, without abiding in the extremes of existence and quiescence.\nAlso translated here as “Blessed One.” (See also note http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-121).

thams cad mkhyen pa|This refers to the gnosis of the Buddha, with which there is nothing he does not know. However, not to confuse “omniscience” with the theistic conception of an omniscient god, the “everything” here is specifically everything about the source of the predicament of worldly life and the way of transcendence of that world through liberation. Since “everything” is only an abstract term without any particular referent, once we are clear about the implications of infinity, it does not refer to any sort of ultimate totality, since a totality can only be relative, i.e., a totality within a particular frame of reference. Thus, as Dharmakīrti has remarked, “it is not a question of the Buddha’s knowing the number of fish in the ocean,” i.e., since there are infinity of fish in infinity of oceans in infinity of worlds and universes. The Buddha’s omniscience, rather, knows how to develop and liberate any fish in any ocean, as well as all other living beings.

In addition to his work on the vinaya, Palgyi Lhünpo translated at least two Mahāyāna sūtras (the Buddhapiṭakaduḥśīlanigraha and the Drumakiṃnararājaparipṛcchā), several chapters of dhāraṇī, and several works in verse included in the Tengyur. The colophons of his translations indicate that Paltsek revised some of his translations, including the Vinayavastu and the Bhikṣuṇī Vinayavibhaṅga, to either complete unfinished work or reflect newly adopted standards.

He was one of the first seven Tibetans to be ordained by Śāntarakṣita and is counted as one of Guru Rinpoche’s twenty-five close disciples. In a famous verse by Ngok Lotsawa, Paltsek is named with Chokro Luyi Gyaltsen and Zhang Nanam Yeshé as part of a group of translators whose skills were surpassed only by Vairotsana. He translated works from a wide variety of genres, including sūtra, śāstra, vinaya, and tantra and was an author himself (for a list of his translations and writings, see Martin, 2011). Paltsek was also one of the most important editors of the early period, one of nine translators installed by Trisong Deutsen to supervise the translation of the Tripiṭaka and help catalogue translated works for the first two of three imperial catalogs (the ldan kar ma and bsam yas mchims phu ma catalogs, which were probably the initiative of Tride Songtsen; see Raine, 2010, 8).

However, Dutt describes it as a drum made of bell metal, which matches the Tibetan translation as “bronze drum,” but he may have been influenced by the Tibetan translation of chapter 30. In an earlier chapter paṇava is simply transcribed into Tibetan. An example of a bell metal drum would be the ceṇṇala, a small flat gong of bell metal that is hit with a stick and used to keep time in South Indian music. Other instruments mentioned are of the South Indian tradition.

He would come to Buddha Śākyamuni, who was not portrayed as omniscient, to inform him of what was occuring in the paradises. He also accompanies Indra on a visit to the Buddha and plays music to bring the Buddha out of his meditation. He performs the same role in the Mahāyāna sūtra The White Lotus of Compassion. He was portrayed as living on a five-peaked mountain, and appears to be the basis for Mañjuśrī, first known as Mañjughoṣa (Beautiful Voice) with Pañcaśikha still being one of Mañjuśrī’s alternate names. In this sūtra he is clearly distinct from Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī.

ma ning|In the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya, the term paṇḍaka (Tib. {ma ning}) encompasses diverse physiological and behavioral conditions, such as intersexuality, erectile dysfunction, and fetishes that imply an inability to engage in normative sexual behavior. Five different types of paṇḍaka are identified in the text (see http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-001-001.html#UT22084-001-001-1616): congenital hermaphrodites, sequential hermaphrodites, fetishists, voyeurs, and those who are sexually impaired (see glossary entries for each). The criteria for being designated a paṇḍaka are not strictly physiological but neither are they grounded exclusively in gender identity or sexual orientation. Paṇḍaka is, in effect, a catchall category and, as such, defies easy translations like “neuter,” “androgyne,” “intersexual,” “transgender,” or “paraphiliac.”\nSee also Gyatso (2003), Cabezón (1993), Zwilling (1992), and Likhitpreechakul (2012).

Paṇḍaka is, in effect, a catchall category and, as such, defies easy translations like “neuter,” “androgyne,” “intersexual,” “transgender,” or “paraphiliac.”\nSee also Gyatso (2003), Cabezón (1993), Zwilling (1992), and Likhitpreechakul (2012).
ma ning|An imprecise, catchall term, difficult to translate. It designates people with various kinds of unclear gender status, including but not restricted to physical intersex conditions and hermaphrodites. It can, for example, also mean a eunuch, or from the Vinaya account of the expulsion of a paṇḍaka , a male who sought other males to have sex with him. See also the glossary entry in http://read.84000.co/translation/toh1-1.html#UT22084-001-001-2567. It could also be applied to a transgender male, not necessarily a eunuch, such as the hijras. Hijras, men who dress as women, have been an established part of Indian society since ancient times and all-hijra communities still have a significant societal role. Hijra is a more recent term with a Hindustani-Urdu origin.

shes rab|In the context‌ of the transcendent perfections, wisdom is the sixth of the six transcendent perfections.\nThe translation of prajñā ({shes rab}) by “wisdom” here defers to the precedent established by Edward Conze in his writings. It has a certain poetic resonance which more accurate renderings—“discernment,”, “discriminative awareness,” or “intelligence”—unfortunately lack. It should be remembered that in Abhidharma, prajñā is classed as one of the five object-determining mental states (pañca­viṣaya­niyata, {yul nges lnga}), alongside “will,” “resolve,” “mindfulness,” and “meditative stability.” Following A­saṅga’s Abhi­dharma­sam­uccaya, Jamgon Kongtrul (TOK, Book 6, Pt. 2, p. 498), defines prajñā as “the discriminative awareness that analyzes specific and general characteristics.” Therefore “wisdom” in this context is to be understood in the cognitive or analytical Germanic sense of witan or weis (Dayal 1932: 136) and not as an abstract “body of knowledge,” or in any aloof and mysterious theosophical sense. Nor indeed is there any association with the Greek sophia.\nAlso translated here as “discriminative awareness.”
shes rab|Also translated here as “wisdom.” See glossary entry.

It is paired with “transcendental analysis” or “insight,” which combines the analytic faculty with this one-pointedness to reach high realizations such as the absence of self (see “transcendental analysis”). “Mental quiescence” and “transcendental analysis” were coined by E. Obermiller in his invaluable study “Prajṅa Pāramitā Doctrine, as Exposed in the Abhisamayālaṃkāra of Maitreya” (Acta Orientalia, Vol. XI [Heidelberg, 1932], pp. 1-134).

yang dag pa'i mtha'|A synonym of the ultimate reality. In the Mahāyāna sūtras, it has a somewhat negative flavor, connoting the Hinayāna concept of a static nirvāṇa. Sthiramati glosses the term as follows: “ ‘Reality’ means undistorted truth. ‘Limit’ means the extreme beyond which there is nothing to be known by anyone” (bhūtaṃ satyam aviparītamityarthaḥ / koṭiḥ paryanto yataḥ pareṇa-anyajjñeyaṃ nāsti…/).

yang dag pa'i mtha'|A synonym for ultimate reality, emptiness, dharmadhātu, and so forth—as either an ontological reality or a state of being—this compound is typically parsed as the “limit” or “frontier” (koṭi) of “reality” (bhūta), which is intended metaphorically, as it is consistently described, in a play on words, as “without limit” (akoṭi) or “infinite” (atyanta). This compound might also be parsed as the “final” or “true” (bhūta) “conclusion” or “goal” (koṭi), although the majority of cases and the Indian Buddhist commentarial tradition tend to support the former interpretation.

chos kyi dbyings|A synonym for emptiness or the ultimate nature of things (see i.4). This term is interpreted variously—given the many connotations of dharma / {chos}—as the sphere, element, or nature, of phenomena, reality, or truth. In this text it is used with this general, Mahāyāna sense, not to be confused with its rather different meaning in the Abhidharma as one of the twelve sense sources (āyatana) and eighteen elements (dhātu) related to mental perception.

sdug pa'i rnam par thar pa|Literally, “release from pleasant states.”
gnas|In “The Chapter on Going Forth,” Kalyāṇamitra reads this as an abbreviation of “reliable instructor” (Tib. {gnas kyi slob dpon}). A reliable monk is one who has passed ten years as a monk and possesses five qualities and is thus fit to guide new monks, grant ordination, and instruction. In “The Chapter on Going Forth,” the Buddha says a monk who has been ordained five years may be considered “reliable” enough to travel without a reliable instructor between monsoons. Though the text does not address the issue, a monk of five years ordination would not, in ordinary circumstances, serve as a reliable instructor.
gnas kyi slob dpon|Newly ordained monks are not allowed to live independently until they have passed ten years as a monk and possess one of twenty-one sets of five qualities described in “The Chapter on Going Forth.” Until that time, they are obliged to live as wards of or apprentices to a reliable instructor so that they may learn and become reliable in the conduct expected of a Buddhist renunciate.\nSee also http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-001-001.html#UT22084-001-001-1229.

lhag pa'i bsam pa|This is a stage in the conception or initiation of the spirit‌ of enlightenment‌. It follows upon the positive thought, or aspiration to attain it, wherein the bodhisattva becomes filled with a lofty determination that he himself should attain enlightenment, that it is the only thing to do to solve his own problems as well as those of all living beings. This high resolve reaches its most intense purity when the bodhisattva simultaneously attains the Path of Insight and the first bodhisattva-stage, the Stage of Joy. The translation follows Lamotte’s happy coinage “haute résolution.”

Śrāvakas are said to expound the doctrine of selflessness only in terms of the absence of personal identity, while pratyekabuddhas additionally realize the emptiness of external phenomena, composed of atomic particles. However, unlike bodhisattvas they do not realize that the internal phenomena of consciousness too are without inherent existence.

In other contexts, a dhāraṇi is a powerful recitation that is a precursor of mantras and is usually in the form of intelligible sentences or phrases that preserve or retain the essence of a teaching. There are two sets of “four retentions” in relation to this text. (A) As explained in the sūtra itself in chapter 24 http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-055-001.html#UT22084-055-001-2336: the retention, respectively, of teachings on composites, on sounds, on kleśas, and on purifications.

rtag tu brnyas pa|A bodhisattva in the distant past, whose name has been translated to mean “Constantly Ridiculed” (sadā-pari­bhūta) in Tibetan and by Burnouf from the Sanskrit. The Chinese translation and Kern from the Sanskrit translate it as “Never Ridiculed” (sadā-apari­bhūta). The difference results from how the compound is broken apart. It is the Chinese and Kern version that better fits the context.

brgya byin|More commonly known in the West as Indra, the deity that is called “lord of the devas” dwells on the summit of Mount Sumeru and wields the thunderbolt.

The highest vedic sacrifice was the horse sacrifice, and there is a tradition that he became the lord of the gods through performing them. Each world with a central Sumeru has a Śakra; therefore this sutra mentions them in the plural.

snyom 'jug|“Absorption” has been translated as “meditation,” “contemplation,” “attainment,” etc., and any of these words might serve. The problem is to establish one English word for each of the important Sanskrit words samāpatti, dhyāna, samādhi, bhāvanā, etc., so as to preserve a consistency with the original. Therefore, I have adopted for these terms, respectively, “absorption,” “contemplation,” “concentration” and “realization” or “cultivation,” reserving the word “meditation” for general use with any of the terms when they are used not in a specific sense but to indicate mind-practice in general.

zhi gnas|One of the basic forms of Buddhist meditation, which focuses on calming the mind. Often presented as part of a pair of meditation techniques, with the other technique being “insight.”
zhi gnas|“Mental quiescence” is a general term for all types of mind-practice, meditation, contemplation, concentration, etc., that cultivate one-pointedness of mind and lead to a state of peacefulness and freedom from concern with any sort of object. It is paired with “transcendental analysis” or “insight,” which combines the analytic faculty with this one-pointedness to reach high realizations such as the absence of self (see “transcendental analysis”). “Mental quiescence” and “transcendental analysis” were coined by E. Obermiller in his invaluable study “Prajṅa Pāramitā Doctrine, as Exposed in the Abhisamayālaṃkāra of Maitreya” (Acta Orientalia, Vol. XI [Heidelberg, 1932], pp. 1-134).

dge 'dun lhag ma|One of five types of transgressions a monk can incur. Second only to a defeat in severity, there are thirteen transgressions requiring transgression whose remnant is restored by the saṅgha. Transgressions of the monastic vows are classed as either atonable (Skt. sāvaśeṣa; Tib. {lhag bcas}) or unatonable (Skt. nirvaśeṣa; Tib. {lhag med}). Unatonable transgressions, such as defeats, entail loss of one’s monk- or nunhood while atonable transgressions can be atoned for in prescribed ways, according to the severity of the offense. When a monk incurs a transgression whose remnant is restored by the saṅgha, the saṅgha imposes a demotion or probation during which the monk must endure a loss of status and privilege and give regular reports on his conduct. Upon completion of this period of penance, the saṅgha may then reinstate the monk with full honors and privileges. There is no consensus on the exact referent of the Sanskrit term vaśeṣa or its Tibetan translation {lhag ma}, though it seems to refer to the “remnant” or “remainder” of a monastic’s precepts that persist in the wake of atonable transgressions. The translation “transgressions whose remnant is restored by the saṅgha” (Tib. {dge 'dun lhag ma}, Skt. saṅghāvaśeṣa)—literally “saṅgha remnant”—follows Kalyāṇamitra’s gloss: a group of “saṅgha” meet to impose a disciplinary act upon an offending monk who retains a remnant of his monastic precepts (Kalyāṇamitra, F.292.a.6-7)\ntransgressions whose remnant is restored by the saṅgha

The main “seat of enlightenment” is the spot under the bo tree at Buddha Gaya, where the Buddha sat and attained unexcelled, perfect enlightenment. It is not to be confused with bodhimaṇḍala, “circle of enlightenment.”

The analogy means the king granted sovereignty to the saṅgha, which was then allowed to govern itself and was not subject to the law of the land. The legal exemption members of the saṅgha enjoyed made it an attractive sanctuary for those on the run from their masters, debt collectors, and the law, who would join the saṅgha for legal rather than spiritual reasons. “From ancient times the legal tradition recognized the right of properly constituted groups to formulate their own laws” (Olivelle, 1993, 209).

bdag|It is crucial to understand what is meant by “self,” before one is able to realize the all-important “absence of self.” Before we can discover an absence, we have to know what we are looking for. In Mahāyāna, there is a self of persons and a self of things, both presumed habitually by living beings and hence informative of their perceptions. Were these “selves” to exist as they appear because of our presumption, they should exist as substantial, self-subsistent entities within things, or as the intrinsic realities of things, or as the intrinsic identities of things, all permanent, unrelated and unrelative, etc. The nondiscovery of such “selves” within changing, relative, interdependent persons and things is the realization of ultimate reality, or absence of self.
bdag|Also translated here as “I.”
bdag med|The absence of any enduring, singular, or independent essence in individuals or phenomena.

bdag med pa|This describes actual reality, as finally there is no enduring person himself or thing itself, since persons and things exist only in the relative, conventional, or superficial sense, and not in any ultimate or absolute sense. To understand Buddhist teaching correctly, we must be clear about the two senses (conventional/ultimate, or relative/absolute), since mistaking denial of ultimate self as denial of conventional self leads to nihilism, and mistaking affirmation of conventional self as affirmation of ultimate self leads to absolutism. Nihilism and absolutism effectively prevent us from realizing our enlightenment, hence are to be avoided.

gang zag la bdag med par phyogs gcig shes pa|Selflessness in this context‌ implies the lack of inherent existence in personal identity and also in physical and mental phenomena. Śrāvakas are said to expound the doctrine of selflessness only in terms of the absence of personal identity, while pratyekabuddhas additionally realize the emptiness of external phenomena, composed of atomic particles. However, unlike bodhisattvas they do not realize that the internal phenomena of consciousness too are without inherent existence.

tshe dang ldan pa|A monk or mendicant of seniority.\nĀyuṣmān ({tshe dang ldan pa}) is a title of respect directed toward a monk or wandering mendicant who is venerable and in a position of seniority, but not a fully realized buddha. (In the Lalita­vistara, ch. 26, Śākyamuni famously rejects this title as a suitable term of address for himself. See, e.g., Dudjom Rinpoche 1991: 423). Āyuṣmān may imply one who has held monastic ordination for a significant number of years, and who has some level of realization, but is still “mortal” and tied to cyclic existence, in contrast to the buddhas, who are “immortal.” Even today Thai monks colloquially address each other, using ayusma for someone senior and avuso (“friend”) for someone junior.

skye mched|The twelve sense-media are eye-medium (cakṣurāyatana), form-medium (rūpa-), ear-medium (śrotra-), sound-medium (śabda-), nose-medium (ghrāna-), scent-medium (gandha-), tongue-medium (jihvā-), taste-medium (rasa-), body-medium (kāya-), texture-medium (spraṣṭavya), mental-medium (mana-), and phenomena-medium (dharmāyatana). In some passages they are enumerated as six, the object-faculty pair being taken as one, and it is this set of six that is the fifth member of the twelve links of dependent origination. The word āyatana is usually translated as “base,” but the Skt., Tib., and Ch. all indicate “something through which the senses function” rather than a basis from which they function; hence “medium” is suggested.

According to Vasubandhu the first category consists of men, the six types of gods of the desire-realm, and the gods of the first realm of contemplation (brahma­vihāra) except those fallen from higher realms (prathamābhinivṛta); the second category consists of those fallen (prathamābhiniṛvṛta) gods who have different bodies but whose intellects are single-mindedly aware of the idea of being created by Brahmā; the third category consists of the gods of the second realm of contemplation—the abhāsvara (clear-light) gods, the parīṭṭābha (radiant) gods, and the apramāṇābha (immeasurably luminous) gods—who have similar luminous bodies but differ in their thoughts, which are bent on the experiences of pleasure and numbness; the fourth category consists of the śubhakṛtsna (pure-wholeness) gods, whose intellects are united in concentration on bliss; the fifth category consists of the immaterial beings who reside in the realm of infinite space; the sixth category consists of the immaterial beings who reside in the realm of infinite consciousness; and the seventh category consists of the immaterial beings who reside in the realm of nothingness. (See also Mvy, Nos. 2289-2295.)

We are so conditioned by signs that they seem to speak to us as if they had a voice of their own. The letter “A” seems to pronounce itself to us as we see it, and the stop-sign fairly shouts at us. However, the configuration of two slanted lines with a crossbar has in itself nothing whatsoever to do with the phenomenon made with the mouth and throat in the open position, when expulsion of breath makes the vocal cords resonate “ah.” By extending such analysis to all signs, we may get an inkling of what is meant by “signlessness,” which is essentially equivalent to voidness, and to “wishlessness” (see entry). Voidness, signlessness, and wishlessness form the “Three Doors of Liberation.”

phung po|This translation of skandha is fairly well established, although some prefer the monosyllabic “group.” It is important to bear in mind that the original skandha has the sense of “pile,” or “heap,” which has the connotation of utter lack of internal structure, of a randomly collocated pile of things; thus “group” may convey a false connotation of structure and ordered arrangement. The five “compulsive” (upādāna) aggregates are of great importance as a schema for introspective meditation in the Abhidharma, wherein each is defined with the greatest subtlety and precision. In fact, the five terms rūpa, vedanā, samjñā, saṃskāra, and vijñāna have such a particular technical sense that many translators have preferred to leave them untranslated. Nevertheless, in the sūtra context, where the five are meant rather more simply to represent the relative living being (in the realm of desire), it seems preferable to give a translation—in spite of the drawbacks of each possible term—in order to convey the same sense of a total categorization of the psychophysical complex. Thus, for rūpa, “matter” is preferred to “form” because it more concretely connotes the physical and gross; for vedanā, “sensation” is adopted, as limited to the aesthetic; for samjñā, “intellect” is useful in conveying the sense of verbal, conceptual intelligence. For samskāra, which covers a number of mental functions as well as inanimate forces, “motivation” gives a general idea. And “consciousness” is so well established for vijñāna (although what we normally think of as consciousness is more like samjñā, i.e., conceptual and notional, and vijñāna is rather the “pure awareness” prior to concepts) as to be left unchallenged.

However, the term is also used (especially in catalogues of canonical works) as a unit measuring the length of texts written in prose or in a mixture of prose and verse, in which case it simply measures thirty-two syllables. The titles of the principal Prajñā­pāramitā sūtras, most of which are written in prose, identify them by including mention of their length in ślokas, usually translated in English as “in nnn lines.” The original titles, even in their long form, include only the number itself, and that this refers to the length in ślokas is by convention inferred.

stong pa nyid|This Skt. term is usually translated by “voidness” because that English word is more rarely used in other contexts than “emptiness” and does not refer to any sort of ultimate nothingness, as a thing-in-itself, or even as the thing-in-itself to end all things-in-themselves. It is a pure negation of the ultimate existence of anything or, in Buddhist terminology, the “emptiness with respect to personal and phenomenal selves,” or “with respect to identity,” or “with respect to intrinsic nature,” or “with respect to essential substance,” or “with respect to self-existence established by intrinsic identity,” or “with respect to ultimate truth-status,” etc. Thus emptiness is a concept descriptive of the ultimate reality through its pure negation of whatever may be supposed to be ultimately real. It is an absence, hence not existent in itself. It is synonymous therefore with “infinity,” “absolute,” etc.—themselves all negative terms, i.e., formed etymologically from a positive concept by adding a negative prefix (in + finite = not finite; ab + solute = not compounded, etc.). But, since our verbally conditioned mental functions are habituated to the connection of word and thing, we tend to hypostatize a “void,” analogous to “outer space,” a “vacuum,” etc., which we either shrink from as a nihilistic nothingness or become attached to as a liberative nothingness; this great mistake can be cured only by realizing the meaning of the “emptiness of emptiness,” which brings us to the tolerance of inconceivability (see “tolerance”).
stong pa nyid|Voidness, emptiness; specifically, the emptiness of absolute substance, truth, identity, intrinsic reality, or self of all persons and things in the relative world, being quite opposed to any sort of absolute nothingness (see glossary, under “emptiness”).

The first five are: divine eye or vision (divyacakṣu), divine hearing (divyaśrotra), knowledge of others’ minds (paracittajñāna), knowledge of former (and future) lives (pūrva­[para]­nivāsānu­smṛti­jñāna), and knowledge of magical operations (ṛddhi­vidhi­jñāna). The sixth, supramundane one is knowledge of the exhaustion of defilements (āsravakṣaya­jñāna).
mgon par shes pa|Supernormal cognitive powers possessed to different degrees by bodhisattvas and buddhas. The five superknowledges are clairvoyance, clairaudience, knowledge of others' minds, miraculous abilities, and knowledge of past lives; a sixth, mentioned in some lists and possessed only by fully enlightened buddhas, is knowlege of the exhaustion of outflows.
mngon par shes pa lnga|There are five supernatural faculties resulting from meditative concentration: divine sight, divine hearing, knowing others’ minds, recollecting past lives, and the ability to perform miracles.
rdzu 'phrul|The supernatural powers of a śrāvaka correspond to the first abhijnā: “Being one he becomes many, being many he becomes one; he becomes visible, invisible; goes through walls, ramparts and mountains without being impeded, just as through air; he immerses himself in the earth and emerges from it as if in water; he goes on water without breaking through it, as if on [solid] earth; he travels through the air crosslegged like a winged bird; he takes in his hands and touches the moon and the sun, those two wonderful, mighty beings, and with his body he extends his power as far as the Brahma world” (Lamotte 2003: 20). The great supernatural powers (mahāṛddhi) of bodhisattvas are: “causing trembling, blazing, illuminating, rendering invisible, transforming, coming and going across obstacles, reducing or enlarging worlds, inserting any matter into one’s own body, assuming the aspects of those one frequents, appearing and disappearing, submitting everyone to one’s will, dominating the supernormal power of others, giving intellectual clarity to those who lack it, giving mindfulness, bestowing happiness, and finally, emitting beneficial rays.” (Lamotte 2003: 30).

Literally it means “thread.” It is also used in other contexts for pithy statements, rules, and aphorisms, on which are strung a commentary and terms of the subdivisions of a sūtra into twelve aspects of the Dharma; in that case, sūtra then means only the prose part of a sūtra.

mdo|Literally meaning “a thread,” this was an ancient term for teachings that were memorized and orally transmitted in an essential form. Therefore it can mean “pithy statements,” “rules,” and “aphorisms.” In Buddhism it refers to the Buddha’s teachings, whatever their length, and in terms of the three divisions of the Buddha’s teachings, it is the category of teachings other than those on the vinaya and abhidharma. It is also used as a category to contrast with the tantra teachings, though a number of important tantras have sūtra in their title. Another very specific meaning is when it is classed as one of the nine or twelve aspects of the Dharma. In that context sūtra means “a teaching given in prose,” and as such is one aspect of what is generally called a sūtra .

mi skye ba'i chos la bzod pa|Here we are concerned with the “intuitive tolerance of the birthlessness (or incomprehensibility) of all things” (anutpattika­dharma­kṣānti or anupalabdhi­dharma­kṣānti). To translate kṣānti as “knowledge” or “conviction” defeats entirely the Skt. usage and its intended sense: In the face of birthlessness or incomprehensibility (i.e., the ultimate reality), ordinary knowledge and especially convictions are utterly lost; this is because the mind loses objectifiability of anything and has nothing to grasp, and its process of coming to terms may be described only as a conscious cancellation through absolute negations of any false sense of certainty about anything. Through this tolerance, the mind reaches a stage where it can bear its lack of bearings, as it were, can endure this kind of extreme openness, this lack of any conviction, etc. There are three degrees of this tolerance—verbal (ghoṣānugā), conforming (anulomikī), and complete. See Introduction, http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-060-005.html#UT22084-060-005-19, and Lamotte, Appendice, Note III.

lhag mthong|This is paired with “mental quiescence” (see entry). In general “meditation” is too often understood as only the types of practices categorized as “quietistic”—which eschew objects, learning, analysis, discrimination, etc., and lead only to the attainment of temporary peace and one-pointedness. However, in order to reach any high realization, such as the absence of a personal self, the absence of a self in phenomena, or voidness, “transcendental analysis,” with its analytical penetration to the nature of ultimate reality, is indispensable. The analysis is called “transcendental” because it does not accept anything it sees as it appears. Instead, through analytic examination, it penetrates to its deeper reality, going ever deeper in infinite penetration until tolerance is reached. All apparently self-sufficient objects are seen through and their truth-status is rejected—first conceptually and finally perceptually, at buddhahood. Thus “meditation,” to be efficacious, must include both mental quiescence (śamatha), and transcendental analysis (vipaśyana) in integrated combination.

dge 'dun lhag ma|One of five types of transgressions a monk can incur. Second only to a defeat in severity, there are thirteen transgressions requiring transgression whose remnant is restored by the saṅgha. Transgressions of the monastic vows are classed as either atonable (Skt. sāvaśeṣa; Tib. {lhag bcas}) or unatonable (Skt. nirvaśeṣa; Tib. {lhag med}). Unatonable transgressions, such as defeats, entail loss of one’s monk- or nunhood while atonable transgressions can be atoned for in prescribed ways, according to the severity of the offense. When a monk incurs a transgression whose remnant is restored by the saṅgha, the saṅgha imposes a demotion or probation during which the monk must endure a loss of status and privilege and give regular reports on his conduct. Upon completion of this period of penance, the saṅgha may then reinstate the monk with full honors and privileges. There is no consensus on the exact referent of the Sanskrit term vaśeṣa or its Tibetan translation {lhag ma}, though it seems to refer to the “remnant” or “remainder” of a monastic’s precepts that persist in the wake of atonable transgressions. The translation “transgressions whose remnant is restored by the saṅgha” (Tib. {dge 'dun lhag ma}, Skt. saṅghāvaśeṣa)—literally “saṅgha remnant”—follows Kalyāṇamitra’s gloss: a group of “saṅgha” meet to impose a disciplinary act upon an offending monk who retains a remnant of his monastic precepts (Kalyāṇamitra, F.292.a.6-7)\ntransgressions whose remnant is restored by the saṅgha

In general, the processes of cyclic existence, through which the external world and the sentient beings within it revolve in a continuous cycle of suffering, propelled by the propensities of past actions and their interaction with afflicted mental states, originate dependent on the sequential unfolding of twelve links, commencing from fundamental ignorance and ending with birth, aging, and death (see http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-155–http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-156). It is only through deliberate reversal of these twelve links that one can succeed in bringing the whole cycle to an end.

don dam pa|“Ultimate” is preferable to the usual “absolute” because it carries fewer connotations than “absolute”—which, however, when understood logically, is also correct. It is contrasted with “superficial” (vyavahāra) or “relative” (samvṛtti) to give the two types, or “levels.,” of truth. It is synonymous with ultimate reality, the uncompounded, voidness, reality, limit of reality, absolute, nirvāṇa, ultimate liberation, infinity, permanence, eternity, independence, etc. It also has the soteriological sense of “sacred” as opposed to “profane” as is conveyed by its literal rendering “supreme” (parama) “object” (artha).
don dam pa|Of final truth or reality.
chos kyi dbyings|This compound is actually metaphorical in sense, with (at least) two interpretations possible because of ambiguities in the word dhātu. Dhātu as in the expression kāmadhātu (desire-realm), may mean “realm”; or it may mean “element,” as in the eighteen elements (see entry), where it is explained as analogous to a mineral such as copper. Thus the realm of the Dharma is the dharmakāyā, the pure source and sphere of the Dharma. And the element of the Dharma is like a mine from which the verbal Dharma, the buddha-qualities, and the wisdoms of the arhats and bodhisattvas are culled. This is metaphorical, as Vimalakīrti would remind us, because the Dharma, the ultimate, is ultimately not a particular place; it is immanent in all places, being the actuality and ultimate condition of all things and being relatively no one thing except, like voidness, the supremely beneficent of concepts.

In that context, volition orients the mind towards objects in ways that may be virtuous, non-virtuous or neutral. In this sūtra, however, the term seems to denote a less specific, manifest aspect of consciousness.

chos kyi 'khor lo bskor ba|This metaphor refers to the promulgation of the Buddhist teachings by the Buddha who is recognized to have promulgated three sequential “turnings of the wheel.” The association with the concept of a wheel derives from a comparison with the “wheel of sharp weapons” said to be held in the hand of a universal monarch. Within the context‌ of this comparison the sacred teachings are composed of ethical discipline (the central axis), analytic wisdom or discriminative awareness (the sharp spokes), and meditative concentration (the stabilising perimeter).

shes rab|In the context‌ of the transcendent perfections, wisdom is the sixth of the six transcendent perfections.\nThe translation of prajñā ({shes rab}) by “wisdom” here defers to the precedent established by Edward Conze in his writings. It has a certain poetic resonance which more accurate renderings—“discernment,”, “discriminative awareness,” or “intelligence”—unfortunately lack. It should be remembered that in Abhidharma, prajñā is classed as one of the five object-determining mental states (pañca­viṣaya­niyata, {yul nges lnga}), alongside “will,” “resolve,” “mindfulness,” and “meditative stability.” Following A­saṅga’s Abhi­dharma­sam­uccaya, Jamgon Kongtrul (TOK, Book 6, Pt. 2, p. 498), defines prajñā as “the discriminative awareness that analyzes specific and general characteristics.” Therefore “wisdom” in this context is to be understood in the cognitive or analytical Germanic sense of witan or weis (Dayal 1932: 136) and not as an abstract “body of knowledge,” or in any aloof and mysterious theosophical sense. Nor indeed is there any association with the Greek sophia.\nAlso translated here as “discriminative awareness.”
