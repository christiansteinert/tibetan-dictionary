It is the collection of such countless predispositions by afflicted mental states that constitutes the obscuration of misconceptions concerning the known range of phenomena, the total eradication of which occurs only when full awakening or buddhahood is achieved.

It literally means something that “causes aggregation” or “causes to be put together.” In a general sense it refers to any phenomenon that comes into being on the basis of causes and conditions. In more specific usage it is also the term describing the fourth of the five aggregates and the second of the twelve links of dependent origination.

'du shes|<term> clear understanding, conception, conceptual notions, discrimination, identification, intellect, name, notion, notions, perception, perceptions, saṃjñā (Skt: saṃjñā, sañjñā): Often this term is translated as “perception” or “discrimination” when it is included as the third of the five aggregates, in which case it refers to the mental function of differentiating and identifying objects according to their qualities. Thus it does not refer to the perceptions of the senses but to the conceptual notions or labels that are ascribed to sense perceptions before they may be conceived by the rational mind. In this sense, they are not really concepts or thoughts either, but rather the fundamental units ascribed to phenomena by the dualistic mind in order to form conceptual thoughts about them. Thus we have translated this as a “notion,” as the verses of theBhavasaṅkrāntisūtraemphasize the insubstantiality of the names as mere notions ascribed to phenomena, which exist as nothing other than a designation imputed by the mind.

Each trichiliocosm is ruled by a god Brahmā; thus, in this context, he bears the title ofSahāṃpati, Lord of Sahā. Our world system of Sahā, or Sahālokadhātu, is also described as being the buddhafield of the Buddha Śākyamuni.

A snake (the reincarnation of the park's previous owner, who still resented the king's acquisition of the park) approached with malign intentions. Through the king's tremendous merit, a gathering ofkalandaka—crows or other birds according to Tibetan renderings, but some Sanskrit and Pali sources suggest flying squirrels—miraculously appeared and began squawking. Their clamor alerted the king's consort to the danger, who rushed back and hacked the snake to pieces, thereby saving the king's life. King Bimbisāra then named the spot Kalandakanivāpa (“Kalandakas' Feeding Ground”), sometimes (though not in theVinayavastu) given as Kalandakanivāpa (“Kalandakas' Abode”) in their honor. The story is told in theSaṅghabhedavastu(Toh 1, ch.17, Degé Kangyur vol.4, folio 77.b et seq.).

bcom ldan 'das ma|<term> bhagavatī, blessed lady (Skt: bhagavatī): The female form of the epithet commonly applied to buddhas and other awakened beings. The Sanskrit wordbhagameans, among other factors, “good fortune,” “happiness,” “prosperity,” and “excellence.” The suffix-vatindicates possession. A common English translation is thus “blessed one” or “fortunate one.” The three syllables of the Tibetan translation mean that the being has “overcome” or “conquered” (Tib.bcom), is “endowed [with qualities]” (Tib.ldan), and has “gone beyond [saṃsāra]” (Tib.'das).
bcom ldan 'das|<person> bhagavān, bhagavat, blessed, blessed one, illustrious one, lord (Skt: bhagavān, bhagavat): In Buddhist literature, an epithet applied to buddhas, most often to Śākyamuni. The Sanskrit term generally means “possessing fortune,” but in specifically Buddhist contexts it implies that a buddha is in possession of six auspicious qualities (bhaga) associated with complete awakening. The Tibetan term—wherebcomis said to refer to “subduing” the four māras,ldanto “possessing” the great qualities of buddhahood, and'dasto “going beyond” saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—possibly reflects the commentarial tradition where the Sanskritbhagavatis interpreted, in addition, as “one who destroys the four māras.” This is achieved either by readingbhagavatasbhagnavat(“one who broke”), or by tracing the wordbhagato the root√bhañj(“to break”).

bcom ral pa|<person> Chom Ralpa, Chomden Rikpai Raldri, Rikpai Raldri: Chomden Rikpai Raldri (bcom ldan rig pa'i ral gri, 1227–1305) was a prominent scholar based at Narthang monastery who compiled an inventory of translated Buddhist texts and guided the compilation of the Old Narthang manuscript Kangyur (no longer extant), which is considered the first Kangyur compiled in Tibet.

bdag med pa|<term> absence of self, nonself, without self (Skt: anātman, anātmatā, nairātmya): This describes actual reality, as finally there is no enduring person himself or thing itself, since persons and things exist only in the relative, conventional, or superficial sense, and not in any ultimate or absolute sense. To understand Buddhist teaching correctly, we must be clear about the two senses (conventional/ultimate, or relative/absolute), since mistaking denial of ultimate self as denial of conventional self leads to nihilism, and mistaking affirmation of conventional self as affirmation of ultimate self leads to absolutism. Nihilism and absolutism effectively prevent us from realizing our enlightenment, hence are to be avoided.

bdag|<term> self, soul (Skt: ātma, ātman): Also translated often as “self” or “I.”
bdag|<term> self, soul (Skt: ātma, ātman): It is crucial to understand what is meant by “self,” before one is able to realize the all-important “absence of self.” Before we can discover an absence, we have to know what we are looking for. In Mahāyāna, there is aselfof persons and aselfof things, both presumed habitually by living beings and hence informative of their perceptions. Were these “selves” to exist as they appear because of our presumption, they should exist as substantial,self-subsistent entities within things, or as the intrinsic realities of things, or as the intrinsic identities of things, all permanent, unrelated and unrelative, etc. The nondiscovery of such “selves” within changing, relative, interdependent persons and things is the realization of ultimate reality, or absence of self.

Thus, the Sugata is “well” gone, as in the expressionsu-rūpa(“having a good form”); he is gone “in a way that he shall not come back,” as in the expressionsu-naṣṭa-jvara(“a fever that has utterly gone”); and he has gone “without any remainder” as in the expressionsu-pūrṇa-ghaṭa(“a pot that is completely full”). According to Buddhaghoṣa, the term means that the way the Buddha went (Skt.gata) is good (Skt.su) and where he went (Skt.gata) is good (Skt.su).

bdud|<term> demon, Māra, māras (Skt: māra, mārāḥ, namuci): (1) As a deva, Māra is said to be the principal deity in the Heaven of Making Use of Others' Emanations (paranirmitavaśavartin), the highest paradise in the desire realm. He famously attempted to prevent the Buddha's awakening under the Bodhi tree—seeThe Play in Full(Toh 95),21.1—and later sought many times to thwart the Buddha's activity. In the sūtras, he often also creates obstacles to the progress of śrāvakas and bodhisattvas. (2) The devas ruled over by Māra are collectively calledmārakāyikaormārakāyikadevatā, the “deities of Māra's family or class.” In general, these māras too do not wish any being to escape from saṃsāra, but can also change their ways and even end up developing faith in the Buddha, as exemplified by Sārthavāha; seeThe Play in Full(Toh 95),21.14and21.43. (3) The term māra can also be understood as personifying four defects that prevent awakening, called (i) the divine māra (devaputramāra), which is the distraction of pleasures; (ii) the māra of Death (mṛtyumāra), which is having one's life interrupted; (iii) the māra of the aggregates (skandhamāra), which is identifying with the five aggregates; and (iv) the māra of the afflictions (kleśamāra), which is being under the sway of the negative emotions of desire, hatred, and ignorance.

The name is said to have arisen when, one day, King Bimbisāra fell asleep after a romantic liaison in the Bamboo Park. While the king rested, his consort wandered off. A snake (the reincarnation of the park's previous owner, who still resented the king's acquisition of the park) approached with malign intentions. Through the king's tremendous merit, a gathering ofkalandaka—crows or other birds according to Tibetan renderings, but some Sanskrit and Pali sources suggest flying squirrels—miraculously appeared and began squawking. Their clamor alerted the king's consort to the danger, who rushed back and hacked the snake to pieces, thereby saving the king's life. King Bimbisāra then named the spot Kalandakanivāpa (“Kalandakas' Feeding Ground”), sometimes (though not in theVinayavastu) given as Kalandakanivāpa (“Kalandakas' Abode”) in their honor.

In some cases, the kalaviṅka also takes on mythical characteristics, being depicted as part human, part bird. It is also the sixteenth of the eighty designs on the palms and soles of a tathāgata.

Through the king's tremendous merit, a gathering ofkalandaka—crows or other birds according to Tibetan renderings, but some Sanskrit and Pali sources suggest flying squirrels—miraculously appeared and began squawking. Their clamor alerted the king's consort to the danger, who rushed back and hacked the snake to pieces, thereby saving the king's life. King Bimbisāra then named the spot Kalandakanivāpa (“Kalandakas' Feeding Ground”), sometimes (though not in theVinayavastu) given as Kalandakanivāpa (“Kalandakas' Abode”) in their honor. The story is told in theSaṅghabhedavastu(Toh 1, ch.17, Degé Kangyur vol.4, folio 77.b et seq.).

byang chub kyi sems bskyed pa|<term> conception of the spirit of enlightenment (Skt: bodhi­cittotpāda): This can also be rendered by “initiation of…” because it means the mental event occurring when a living being, having been exposed to the teaching of the Buddha or of his magical emanations (e.g., Vimalakīrti), realizes simultaneously his own level of conditioned ignorance, i.e., that his habitual stream of consciousness is like sleep compared to that of one who has awakened from ignorance; the possibility of his own attainment of a higher state of consciousness; and the necessity of attaining it in order to liberate other living beings from their stupefaction. Having realized this possibility, he becomes inspired with the intense ambition to attain, and that is called the “conception of the spirit of enlightenment.” “Spirit” is preferred to “mind” because the mind of enlightenment should rather be the mind of the Buddha, and to “thought” because a “thought of enlightenment” can easily be produced without the initiation of any sort of new resolve or awareness. “Will” also serves very well here.

These correspond to the wish to go and then actually setting out.” On the level of absolute truth, bodhicitta is the realization of emptiness or the awakened mind itself.

In this sense themahā-is closer in its connotations to themahā-in “Mahāyāna” than to the mahā- in “mahāsiddha.” While individual bodhisattvas described asmahāsattvamay in many cases also be “great” in terms of their level of realization, this is largely coincidental, and in the canonical texts the epithet is not restricted to bodhisattvas at any particular point in their career.

This term is interpreted variously‍—given the many connotations ofdharma/chos—as the sphere, element, or nature of phenomena, suchness, or truth.

Thus the realm of the Dharma is the dharmakāyā, the pure source and sphere of the Dharma. And the element of the Dharma is like a mine from which the verbal Dharma, the buddha-qualities, and the wisdoms of the arhats and bodhisattvas are culled. This is metaphorical, as Vimalakīrti would remind us, because the Dharma, the ultimate, isultimatelynot a particular place; it is immanent in all places, being the actuality and ultimate condition of all things and being relatively no one thing except, like voidness, the supremely beneficent of concepts.

dben par spyod pa|<person> Practicing Detachment: Name of a teacher in a story the Buddha tells.
dben pa|<term> detachment, disengagement, isolated, isolated state, isolation, secluded, singled out, solitude, void (Skt: viveka, vivikta, viviktatā): This may refer to either literal, bodily isolation, i.e., seclusion, or to the isolation of the mind from certain (usually undesirable) mental factors. The two senses are related, and as the relationship between the two senses is both implicitly and explicitly thematized in Buddhist texts, a single translation for both the more “outer” and the more “inner”forms of isolation is here meant to respect a clearly intended suggestion found throughout Buddhist literature. The term can also refer to conceptual isolation, i.e., discernment.
dben pa|<term> detachment, disengagement, isolated, isolated state, isolation, secluded, singled out, solitude, void (Skt: viveka, vivikta, viviktatā): Detachment is traditionally categorized as being of three types: (1) detachment or seclusion of the body (kāyaviveka), which refers to remaining in solitude free from desirous or disturbing objects; (2) detachment or seclusion of the mind (cittaviveka), which is mental detachment from desirous or disturbing objects; and, (3) detachment or seclusion from the “substrate” (upadhiviveka), which indicates detachment from all things that perpetuate rebirth, including the five aggregates, thekleśas, karma, etc. This last category is what is being referenced here.
dben pa|<term> detachment, disengagement, isolated, isolated state, isolation, secluded, singled out, solitude, void (Skt: viveka, vivikta, viviktatā): This term usually has to do with a subjective state of 'isolation,' 'separation,' or 'withdrawal,' rather than a metaphysical idea. TheAkṣayamatinirdeśa-sūtracontains a more or less parallel discussion ofdben pa nyidin connection with diligence: “de la 'jug pa gang zhe na gang dge ba'i rtsa ba thams cad rtsom pa'o/ gnas pa gang zhe na. gangs sems dben pa'o.” Jens Braarvig translates this passage: “What then is activity? Undertaking all roots of good. What then is stillness? Aloofness of thought.” (Braarvig, vol. 1, pp. 175-76; vol. 2, p. 50.) Heresems dben pais glossed in theAkṣayamatinirdeśaṭīkā(of Vasubandhu or perhaps Sthiramati) as:sems dben pa ni mi dge ba spangs pa dang dge ba rtsom pa gang la yang mi rtog pa'o. This can be translated as, “Disengagement of one's thought is not thinking at all about giving up the non-virtuous and undertaking the virtuous.” In any case, the termviviktatāin this context and in theAkṣayamatinirdeśadoes not seem to be about emptiness, but more about a type of aloof or disengaged diligence that does not conceptualize the virtues and non-virtues of the actions undertaken.

dge 'dun lhag ma|<term> saṅgha stigmata (Skt: saṅghāvaśeṣa): One of five types of offenses a monk can incur. Second only to a defeat in severity, there are thirteen saṅgha stigmata. Offenses against the monastic vows are classed as either atonable (Skt.sāvaśeṣa; Tib.lhag bcas) or unatonable (Skt.nirvaśeṣa; Tib.lhag med). Unatonable offenses, such as defeats, entail loss of one's monk- or nunhood while atonable offenses can be atoned for in prescribed ways, according to the severity of the offense. When a monk incurs an offense whose remnant is restored by the saṅgha, the saṅgha imposes a probation and penance during which the monk must endure a loss of status and privilege and give regular reports on his conduct. Upon completion of this period of probation and penance, the saṅgha may then reinstate the monk with full honors and privileges. There is no consensus on the exact referent of the Sanskrit termvaśeṣaor its Tibetan translationlhag ma, though it seems to refer to the “remnant” or “remainder” of a monastic's precepts that persist in the wake of atonable offenses. The translation “saṅgha stigmata”—literally “saṅgha remnant”—follows Kalyāṇamitra's gloss: a group of “saṅgha” meet to impose a disciplinary act upon an offending monk who retains a remnant of his monastic precepts (Kalyāṇamitra, folio 292.a.6–7).

As part of their doctrine of “threefold nonapprehending/nonreferentiality” ('khor gsum mi dmigs pa), Mahāyāna Buddhists famously assert that all three categories of apprehending lack substantiality.

don rnam par nges pa|<term> distinctly ascertaining the meanings (Skt: arthaviniścaya): TheNibandhanacommentary explains the termarthaviniścayatwice. It first states, “ 'Distinctly ascertaining the meanings' means classifying/analyzing the dharmas” (arthānāṁ viniścayo dharmāṇāṁ pravicayaḥ, Samtani 1971, p. 73). This interpretation equatesarthaviniścayawith the key termdharmapravicaya(“classifying the dharmas”), a synonym of “higher cognition” (prajñā), “special insight” (vipaśyanā), and, importantly,abhidharma. The second explanation is slightly more elaborate: “For sentient beings, by listening to this, there is an ascertainment of the meaning/purpose in manifold ways; thus, this is anamewherein the meaning corresponds” (arthasya vividhākāreṇa niścayo bhavaty etat-śravaṇāt sattvānām ity anugatārthā saṁjñā, Samtani 1971, p. 83). Samtani (1971, p. 57ff.) argues against taking the wordarthato here signify “meaning(s),” and suggests instead that it should be understood as “topic,” “subject matter,” or “category”; thus, while Ferrari's previous rendering would translate into English as “the determination of the meaning” (“la determinazione del significato,” Ferrari 1944, p. 588) and match our own preference, his own translation ofarthaviniścayais “compendium of categories” (Samtani 2002, p. 3). Bhikkhu Ānandajoti prefers “analysisof the topics” (Ānandajoti 2016, front cover), which also matches Norman's preference (“analysisof the (Buddhist) topics,” Norman 1973, p. 677). While we do not think that translating as either “category” or “topic” is, per se,wrong(for, one could say, the two senses ofarthaas “topic” andarthaas “meaning” are somewhat overlapping), the arguments offered by Samtani do not entirely convince us. One of his arguments is thatdharma= “category,” and therefore, since the commentary tells us thatartha=dharma, it follows thatarthais a category; here our difficulty is with the premise, since we believe that heredharmameans “entity” rather “category,” and indeed dharmas as entities are meanings/referents as opposed to words (śabda). Another argument adduced by Samtani is based on his interpretation of a quote from Yaśomitra, wherearthais equated withviṣaya, which in turn Samtani explains as “subject matter.” However, we think that the context of that passage (Wogihara 1989, p. 23) rather strongly suggests that it is not explaining the wordarthaas meaning “subject matter” but rather as “object,” i.e.,viṣayaas “domain,” here in the sense of the domain of sensory activity of one of the five sense faculties. Yaśomitra is here explaining the termarthaappearing in the expression “objects of the sense faculties” (indriyārthāḥ,Abhidharmakośakārikā1.9). Furthermore, we are not entirely sure that the sense ofarthain the two explanations offered by theNibandhanais exactly the same; we think that in the second explanation it is quite possible thatartha(in the singular, unlike in the first interpretation) also, or maybe even primarily, carries the sense of “purpose” or “goal” (one could say “what is meaningful,” with a bit of a stretch). It is also quite likely that different nuances of the sense ofarthaare implied in the commentary, which is avirtuerather than a defect in Sanskrit writing (as we understand it). We opted for “meaning” for the following reasons: it has a somewhat more vague/less specified feel (to us; “ascertaining the topics” could well mean ascertaining which topics are there (rather than, in fact, ascertaining their meanings); and, also taking into account other passages where the termarthaviniścayaoccurs, we think it desirable to retain at least a suggestion of the opposition between “word” versus “meaning” (śabdavs.artha), which is of crucial importance in the Buddhist tradition (“relying on the meaning rather than on the words” is one of the four reliances (pratiśaraṇa); “relying on the topics” or “on the categories” may not sound too far from “relying on the words,” let alone be its opposite. Thus, “meaning/meaningful/purpose/what has purpose” is the range of meanings that we primarily read in thearthaappearing in the expressionarthaviniścaya. The following passages use the termarthaviniścayain contexts that are different from our sūtra, and thus we do not claim that any of them, or even all of them taken together, should lead to a conclusive ascertainment of the meaning ofartha. However, we think they may clarify our purpose in using “meaning”: “The awareness of all sounds of speech; the awareness of the etymological explanations; the awareness of the distinct ascertainment of the meaning/what is meaningful/what is of benefit; the avoidance of what is not of benefit/what is meaningless” (sarvarutajñānaṃ niruktivyavasthānajñānaṃ arthaviniścayajñānaṃ anarthavivarjanaṁ,Samādhirājasūtra37.27; Dutt 1941, p. 18). “He sets aside the incoherent meaning/unconnected purpose; he is very certain in respect to the distinct ascertainment of the meanings/purposes” (asaṃsaktam artham uddharati suviniścito bhavati arthaviniścaye,Śayanāsanavastu,Gnoli 1978b, p. 45). “This is a negation of the word-meaning; the real thing is not set aside. In this way, the distinct ascertainment of the meaning should also be understood in respect to other sentences” (śabdārthapratiṣedho 'yaṃ na vastu vinivāryate evam anyeṣv api jñeyo vākyeṣv arthaviniścayaḥ,Prajñāpāramitāpiṇḍārthaḥof Dignāga, Tucci 1947, p. 58; Tucci here translatesarthaviniścayaḥas “determination of the things,” p. 65). “What is the distinct ascertainment of the meaning? It is where there is a distinct ascertainment in respect to six meanings. Which six meanings? The meaning of own-being, the meaning of cause, the meaning of result, the meaning of karma, the meaning of yoga, and the meaning of occurrence” (arthaviniścayaḥ katamaḥ yatra ṣaḍarthān ārabhya viniścayo bhavati katame ṣaḍ arthāḥ svabhāvārthaḥ hetvarthaḥ phalārthaḥ karmārthaḥ yogārthaḥ vṛttyarthaś ca,Abhidharmasamuccaya,Hayashima 2003, p. 858).

In particular, the five are Abṛha (mi che ba), the inferior heaven; Atapa (mi gdung ba), the heaven of no torment; Sudṛśa (gya nom snang), the heaven of sublime appearances; Sudarśana (shin tu mthong), the heaven of the most beautiful to behold; and Akaniṣṭha ('og min), the highest heaven.
gtsang ris|<place> pure abodes, Śuddhāvāsa (Skt: śuddhāvāsa): Yaśomitra explains their names, stating: (1) because those who abide there can only remain for a fixed amount of time, before they are plucked out (√bṛh,bṛṃhanti) of that heaven, or because it is not as extensive (abṛṃhita) as the others in the pure realms, that heaven is called the inferior heaven (abṛha;mi che ba); (2) since the afflictions can no longer torment (√tap,tapanti) those who reside there because of their having attained a particular samādhi, or because their state of mind is virtuous, they no longer torment (√tap,tāpayanti) others, this heaven, consequently, is called the heaven of no torment (atapa;mi gdung ba); (3) since those who reside there have exceptional (suṣṭhu) vision because what they see (√dṛś,darśana) is utterly pure, that heaven is called the heaven of sublime appearances (sudṛśa;gya nom snang); (4) because those who reside there are beautiful gods, that heaven is called the heaven of the most beautiful to behold (sudarśana;shin tu mthong); and (5) since it is not lower (na kaniṣṭhā) than any other heaven because there is no other place superior to it, this heaven is called the highest heaven (akaniṣṭha;'og min) since it is the uppermost.

A snake (the reincarnation of the park's previous owner, who still resented the king's acquisition of the park) approached with malign intentions. Through the king's tremendous merit, a gathering ofkalandaka—crows or other birds according to Tibetan renderings, but some Sanskrit and Pali sources suggest flying squirrels—miraculously appeared and began squawking. Their clamor alerted the king's consort to the danger, who rushed back and hacked the snake to pieces, thereby saving the king's life. King Bimbisāra then named the spot Kalandakanivāpa (“Kalandakas' Feeding Ground”), sometimes (though not in theVinayavastu) given as Kalandakanivāpa (“Kalandakas' Abode”) in their honor. The story is told in theSaṅghabhedavastu(Toh 1, ch.17, Degé Kangyur vol.4, folio 77.b et seq.).

khams bcwa brgyad|<term> eighteen bases, eighteen constituent elements, eighteen constituents (Skt: aṣṭādaśadhātu): Eighteen collections of similar dharmas under which all coproduced and unproduced dharmas may be included: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and thought, plus their objects—visible forms, sounds, smells, flavors, tangibles, and dharmas—plus the consciousnesses corresponding to each of the first six. The eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and thought are the basis for the arising of consciousness, though here there is the technical sense of a prior moment in any of the six consciousnesses. The first five consciousnesses depend on the five sense faculties as their basis, while the basis for the thought consciousness can be any of the six consciousnesses but not a sense faculty. Hence thought is classified among thedhātus(“elements”) in the section meant to offer a complete list of the possible bases of consciousness, i.e., what is most frequently listed as the second set of six elements. The termdhātuis explained as having the sense of an ore (gotra), like a mineral ore, hence a point of origin (ākara). The bases are the points of origin for the arising of similar dharmas. TheNibandhanacommentary onDistinctly Ascertaining the Meaningsexplains that the order of enumeration of the eighteen bases can be explained in terms of the specific way in which different sense faculties operate within their domains or in terms of the placement (from higher to lower) of the eye faculty, the ear faculty, and so forth. TheAbhidharmakośaexplains that the teaching of the bases is for those who are of weaker abilities, since it is very detailed; it is for those who prefer special insight meditation (vipaśyanā), because it contains extensive analysis; and it counteracts a delusion of “self” that is evenly distributed between sentient and nonsentient elements, since the eighteen bases offer an analysis both of form and of mind and mental derivatives.

In Buddhist cosmology the devas occupy the highest of the five or six “destinies” (gati) of saṃsāra among which beings take rebirth. The devas reside in thedevalokas, “heavens” that traditionally number between twenty-six and twenty-eight and are divided between the desire realm (kāmadhātu), form realm (rūpadhātu), and formless realm (ārūpyadhātu). A being attains rebirth among the devas either through meritorious deeds (in the desire realm) or the attainment of subtle meditative states (in the form and formless realms). While rebirth among the devas is considered favorable, it is ultimately a transitory state from which beings will fall when the conditions that lead to rebirth there are exhausted. Thus, rebirth in the god realms is regarded as a diversion from the spiritual path.

In Buddhist cosmology the devas occupy the highest of the five or six “destinies” (gati) of saṃsāra among which beings take rebirth. The devas reside in thedevalokas, “heavens” that traditionally number between twenty-six and twenty-eight and are divided between the desire realm (kāmadhātu), form realm (rūpadhātu), and formless realm (ārūpyadhātu). A being attains rebirth among the devas either through meritorious deeds (in the desire realm) or the attainment of subtle meditative states (in the form and formless realms). While rebirth among the devas is considered favorable, it is ultimately a transitory state from which beings will fall when the conditions that lead to rebirth there are exhausted. Thus, rebirth in the god realms is regarded as a diversion from the spiritual path.

mA ra|<term> māra (Skt: māra): (1) As a deva, Māra is said to be the principal deity in the Heaven of Making Use of Others' Emanations (paranirmitavaśavartin), the highest paradise in the desire realm. He famously attempted to prevent the Buddha's awakening under the Bodhi tree—seeThe Play in Full(Toh 95),21.1—and later sought many times to thwart the Buddha's activity. In the sūtras, he often also creates obstacles to the progress of śrāvakas and bodhisattvas. (2) The devas ruled over by Māra are collectively calledmārakāyikaormārakāyikadevatā, the “deities of Māra's family or class.” In general, these māras too do not wish any being to escape from saṃsāra, but can also change their ways and even end up developing faith in the Buddha, as exemplified by Sārthavāha; seeThe Play in Full(Toh 95),21.14and21.43. (3) The term māra can also be understood as personifying four defects that prevent awakening, called (i) the divine māra (devaputramāra), which is the distraction of pleasures; (ii) the māra of Death (mṛtyumāra), which is having one's life interrupted; (iii) the māra of the aggregates (skandhamāra), which is identifying with the five aggregates; and (iv) the māra of the afflictions (kleśamāra), which is being under the sway of the negative emotions of desire, hatred, and ignorance.

mtshan ma med pa|<term> absence of attributes, absence of characteristics, absence of distinguishing marks, absence of marks, absence of phenomenal marks, appearancelessness, marklessness, signlessness, without signs (Skt: animitta, animittatā): Emptiness (stong pa nyid), signlessness (mtshan ma med pa), and wishlessness (smon pa med pa) are known as the “three doors to deliverance” (triṇivimokṣamukhāni) or the “three concentrations” (trayaḥ samādhyaḥ) and as a set appear in both mainstream Buddhist sūtras and Mahāyāna sūtras. See Conze 1962, pp. 59–69; Lamotte 1944, pp. 1213–15; and Deleanu 2000, pp. 74–78.
mtshan ma med pa|<term> absence of attributes, absence of characteristics, absence of distinguishing marks, absence of marks, absence of phenomenal marks, appearancelessness, marklessness, signlessness, without signs (Skt: animitta, animittatā): In ultimate reality, there is no sign, as a sign signals or signifies something to someone and hence is inextricably involved with the relative world. We are so conditioned by signs that they seem to speak to us as if they had a voice of their own. The letter “A” seems to pronounce itself to us as we see it, and the stop-sign fairly shouts at us. However, the configuration of two slanted lines with a crossbar has in itself nothing whatsoever to do with the phenomenon made with the mouth and throat in the open position, when expulsion of breath makes the vocal cords resonate “ah.” By extending such analysis to all signs, we may get an inkling of what is meant by “signlessness,” which is essentially equivalent to voidness, and to “wishlessness” (see entry). Voidness,signlessness, and wishlessness form the “Three Doors of Liberation.”

Advertence toward the generic sign and secondary characteristics of an object furnishes the conception or nominal designation (Skt.saṃjñā) of that object, which may in turn generate clinging or rejection and ultimately lead to suffering.
mtshan ma|<term> causal sign, characteristics, conceptual signs, conceptualization, distinguishing mark, feature, mark, phenomenal appearance, phenomenal mark, sign, signs (Skt: nimitta): A mark or feature of an object which serves as the basis for its being generically named and thus conceptually categorized. A distinguishing mark is usually imagined rather than being a real attribute of the object, and perception that operates by identifying distinguishing marks is therefore what defines coarse conceptuality. In some contexts (particularly with respect to meditative concentration practices),nimittacan be translated as “mental image.” Also translated in this text as “sign.”

mya ngan 'das|<term> extinguished (Skt: nirvṛta): More specifically, three main types of nirvāṇa are identified. The first type of nirvāṇa, called nirvāṇa with remainder (sopadhiśeṣanirvāṇa), is when an arhat or buddha has attained awakening but is still dependent on the conditioned aggregates until their lifespan is exhausted. At the end of life, given that there are no more causes for rebirth, these aggregates cease and no new aggregates arise. What occurs then is called nirvāṇa without remainder (anupadhiśeṣanirvāna), which refers to the unconditioned element (dhātu) of nirvāṇa in which there is no remainder of the aggregates. The Mahāyāna teachings distinguish the final nirvāṇa of buddhas from that of arhats, the latter of which is not considered ultimate. The buddhas attain what is called nonabiding nirvāṇa (apratiṣthitanirvāṇa), which transcends the extremes of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, i.e., existence and peace. This is the nirvāṇa that is the goal of the Mahāyāna path.

mya ngan bsring ba|<term> monks and nuns: This is likely a pre-reform expression. We were unable to determine the exact meaning of this Tibetan expression, and we did not find it used elsewhere in either the Kangyur or the Tengyur. In theDictionary of Old Tibetan Orthography(Tib.bod yig brda rnying tshig mdzod) by rnam rgyal tshe ring (2001), we find the entrynyon mongs bzod; one who endures hardship or suffering, as an older Tibetan expression for a monk or nun (Tib.dge slong gi ming). Thus, one literal translation that we are proposing for this expression is “one who sustains (or endures) suffering (or hardship).” Comparison with similar contexts in related texts (Toh 338,(F.278.ab)) andpassim, i.e., where we findrab tu byung ba tshul dang ldan pa rnamsetc. instead, suggests that the expression may be a collective term for those who have entered the path to liberation (Skt.āryapudgala; Pāliariyapuggala) or for the Buddhist saṅgha generally. See also “those who have entered the path of liberation.”

phung po|<term> aggregate, Aggregates, psycho-physical aggregates, skandha, skandhas (Skt: skandha): This translation ofskandhais fairly well established, although some prefer the monosyllabic “group.” It is important to bear in mind that the originalskandhahas the sense of “pile,” or “heap,” which has the connotation of utter lack of internal structure, of a randomly collocated pile of things; thus “group” may convey a false connotation of structure and ordered arrangement. The five “compulsive” (upādāna)aggregatesare of great importance as a schema for introspective meditation in the Abhidharma, wherein each is defined with the greatest subtlety and precision. In fact, the five termsrūpa,vedanā,samjñā,saṃskāra, andvijñānahave such a particular technical sense that many translators have preferred to leave them untranslated. Nevertheless, in the sūtra context, where the five are meant rather more simply to represent the relative living being (in the realm of desire), it seems preferable to give a translation—in spite of the drawbacks of each possible term—in order to convey the same sense of a total categorization of the psychophysical complex. Thus, forrūpa, “matter” is preferred to “form” because it more concretely connotes the physical and gross; forvedanā, “sensation” is adopted, as limited to the aesthetic; forsamjñā, “intellect” is useful in conveying the sense of verbal, conceptual intelligence. Forsamskāra, which covers a number of mental functions as well as inanimate forces, “motivation” gives a general idea. And “consciousness” is so well established forvijñāna(although what we normally think of as consciousness is more likesamjñā, i.e., conceptual and notional, andvijñānais rather the “pure awareness” prior to concepts) as to be left unchallenged.

In this paragraph,sems canhas the connotation of beings who do not practice the yoga taught in this chapter, that is,ordinary beings.
rang bzhin gsum|<term> three natures (Skt: trisvabhāva, trividhā niḥsvabhāvatā): These comprise the imaginary, dependent, and consummate essenceless natures, which are elaborated particularly in thediscoursesassociated with the third turning of the wheel. They are not directly discussed in this text but are similar to explanations in the Maitreya Chapter (chapter 72) and are also used as an underlying analytical key in some commentaries. See introduction.

This terminology is characteristic of Yogācāra discourse.
rang bzhin gyi snying po 'byung ba'i gtsug tor|<person> Uṣṇīṣa Arisen from the Natural Essence: The central figure of the maṇḍala surrounded by a group of eight uṣṇīṣa buddhas mentioned in this text that do not appear elsewhere in the canon.

rang bzhin yang dag par 'phags pa'i rgyal po|<person> Svabhāvasamudgatarāja (Skt: svabhāva­samudgata­rāja): One of the tathāgatas attending the delivery of the MMK.
rang bzhin|<term> basic character, basic nature, disposition, fundamental, identity, inherent existence, inherent nature, intrinsic nature, nature, own nature, prakṛti (Skt: jātika, prakṛti, svabhāva): “According to Sāṁkhya, the prime substance, from which the material universe evolves, as opposed topuruṣa, pure consciousness.” (Reat, 39 n5).
rang bzhin|<term> basic character, basic nature, disposition, fundamental, identity, inherent existence, inherent nature, intrinsic nature, nature, own nature, prakṛti (Skt: jātika, prakṛti, svabhāva): This term denotes the ontological status of phenomena, according to which they are attributed with existence in their own right, inherently, in and of themselves, objectively, and independent of any other phenomena such as our conception and labeling. The absence of such an ontological reality is defined as the true nature of reality, emptiness.
rang bzhin|<term> basic character, basic nature, disposition, fundamental, identity, inherent existence, inherent nature, intrinsic nature, nature, own nature, prakṛti (Skt: jātika, prakṛti, svabhāva): A fundamental ontological principle of the non-Buddhist Sāṅkhya tradition.Prakṛtiis the undifferentiated potentiality that contains all possible transformations of thought and matter. It can either persist in an unmanifest or manifest state, manifesting only when it comes into contact with the second fundamental Sāṅkya principle,puruṣa, a basic mode of timeless awareness. When these two come into contact, the internal complexities of cognition and perception and the external complexities of the material world progressively unfold, thereby creating the known universe.
rang bzhin|<term> basic character, basic nature, disposition, fundamental, identity, inherent existence, inherent nature, intrinsic nature, nature, own nature, prakṛti (Skt: jātika, prakṛti, svabhāva): Svabhāvais usually rendered as “self-nature,” sometimes as “own-being,” both of which have a certain literal validity. However, neither artificial term has any evocative power for the reader who has no familiarity with the original, and a term must be found that the reader can immediately relate to his own world to fulfill the function the original word had in its world. In our world ofidentities(national, racial, religious, personal, sexual, etc.), “identity” is a part of our makeup; thus, when we are taught the ultimate absence ofidentityof all persons and things, it is easy to “identify” what is supposedly absent and hence to try to understand what that entails.
rang bzhin|<term> basic character, basic nature, disposition, fundamental, identity, inherent existence, inherent nature, intrinsic nature, nature, own nature, prakṛti (Skt: jātika, prakṛti, svabhāva): This term (also rendered here as “inherent existence” and “inherent nature”) literally means “own-being” and can be used in an ordinary sense to denote the most fundamental or characteristic quality, property, or nature of things. In Mahāyāna literature it is also used in several different ways in the examination of the ontological status of phenomena, most frequently in statements denying that phenomena may ultimately possess any such existence or nature, objectively in their own right, apart from ignorantly attributed concepts and designations. However, in the Yogācāra system and later literature the incompleteness of an ontological status is described in three or more successive levels or aspects that also use modulations of the same term; see “three natures.”

They attain realization of the nature of dependent origination, the selflessness of the person, and a partial realization of the selflessness of phenomena, by observing the suchness of all that arises through interdependence. This is the result of progress in previous lives but, unlike a buddha, they do not have the necessary merit, compassion or motivation to teach others.

The legal exemption members of the saṅgha enjoyed made it an attractive sanctuary for those on the run from their masters, debt collectors, and the law, who would join the saṅgha for legal rather than spiritual reasons. “From ancient times the legal tradition recognized the right of properly constituted groups to formulate their own laws” (Olivelle, 1993, 209).

rig pa 'dzin pa|<term> knowledge-holder, vidyā holder, vidyādhara (Skt: vidyādhara): A type of semidivine being whose identiy has shifted over time and genre.

rig pa dang zhabs su ldan pa|<term> endowed with knowledge and feet, perfect in wisdom and conduct (Skt: vidyācaraṇa­sampanna): A common description of buddhas. According to some explanations, “wisdom” refers to awakening, and “conduct” to the three trainings (bslab pa gsum) by means of which a buddha attains that awakening; according to others, “wisdom” refers to right view, and “conduct” to the other seven elements of the eightfold path.
rig pa dang zhabs su ldan pa|<term> endowed with knowledge and feet, perfect in wisdom and conduct (Skt: vidyācaraṇa­sampanna): TheNibandhanaexplains this as a metaphor of the eye and the feet, which, operating together, allow one to move; knowledge, interpreted as either “right view” or as “the training in wisdom,” is like the eye, while the other seven parts of the noble eightfold path, or the two other trainings in discipline and samādhi, function as the “feet.” This explanation is also found in thesgra sbyor bam po gnyis pacommentary on theMahāvyutpatti, which further clarifies thatzhabsis here simply the honorific term for “foot” (caraṇa ni rkang pa). Thus, although it is not uncommon to translatecaraṇahere with “conduct,” this loses the significance of the metaphor.

Applied to buddhas they are called三達, and applied to worthy ones they are called三明. They are the power of divine vision (天眼通), whereby they can observe the full course of passage by sentient beings through the six destinies; the power of the knowledge of previous lifetimes (宿命通), (宿住通), whereby they know the events of countless kalpas of previous lifetimes experienced by themselves, as well as by all the beings in the six destinies; and the power of the extinction of contamination (漏盡通), whereby they completely extinguish all the afflictions of the three realms and thus are no longer subject to rebirth in the three realms. In theAbhidharmakośabhāṣya(倶舍論) 27, the three are termed住智識證明,死生識證明, and漏盡識證明(Skt.tri-vidya,tisrovidyāḥ,traividya; Pāliti-vijjā; Tib.rig pa gsum).

According to Buddhist scholars, thought in itself is simply a function, and only thought that is attached to its own content over and above the relative object, i.e., “egoistic” thought, is bad and to be eliminated. Therefore we have chosen a set of words for the seven Skt. terms: respectively, “conceptualization,” “imagination,” “presumption,” “exaggeration,” “construction,” “conception” or “notion,” and “fabrication.” This does not mean that these words are not somewhat interchangeable or that another English word might not be better in certain contexts; it only represents an attempt to achieve consistency with the original usages.

For the sixthconsciousness, see also “mind consciousness.”
rnam par shes pa|<term> cognition, consciousness, vijñāna (Skt: vijñāna): The fifth of the five aggregates; also counted as the sixth of the six elements. In most Abhidharma accounts it comprises the six sensoryconsciousnesses, but in Yogācāra theory two more kinds ofconsciousness, afflicted (kliṣṭamanas) and storehouse (ālayavijñāna), are added.

rnam par shes pa|<term> cognition, consciousness, vijñāna (Skt: vijñāna): Fifth of the five aggregates; also third of the twelve links of dependent origination. Consciousness is defined as “an awareness which is knowing and luminous.” Not being physical, it lacks resistance to obstruction. It has neither shape nor color, and it can be experienced but not externally perceived as an object. A distinction is made between the mundane consciousness of beings, and thewisdomof the buddhas. In the context‌ of the present discourse, the former includes six aspects of consciousness, namely, visual consciousness, auditory consciousness, olfactory consciousness, tactile consciousness, and mental consciousness, the last of which objectively refers to mental phenomena.
rnam par shes pa|<term> cognition, consciousness, vijñāna (Skt: vijñāna): The termvijñānais formed by the prefixviplus a formation from the rootjñā, which means “to know,” “to understand,” “to know of,” “to be aware of.” (This is reproduced in the Tibetan asrnam par+shes pa.) “Consciousness” has a specific meaning in Buddhist texts and refers to awareness of an object, point of reference, or support. This meaning is occasionally obtained by understanding thevias standing forviṣaya, which means a domain of activity and, in this case, the object of perception. The standard list of consciousness types is six, corresponding to the five sense faculties plus the “thought consciousness.” This refers to a type of mental perception that arises taking as its basis not a sense faculty but a prior moment of consciousness itself; this type of consciousness is unrestricted as per its possible range of objects, both in terms of their location in time (past, present, or future) and in terms of their type (visual, audible, etc., including entities that are not within the range of any of the five senses).

rten cing 'brel par 'byung ba|<term> dependent arising, dependent origination (Skt: pratītya­samutpāda): The teaching that everything arises in dependence on something else, which is also applied to the entire process of life and death. This became standardized into twelve sequences of dependent origination, beginning with ignorance, followed by formation, and concluding in death. In the Pali suttas, this was more often taught as a greater number of successive sequences, commencing with ignorance and formation being simultaneous and codependent, like two sticks leaning against each other.

It is only through deliberate reversal of these twelve links that one can succeed in bringing the whole cycle to an end. The twelve links are enumerated many times in the text, starting at. See also “twelve links of dependent origination.”
rten cing 'brel par 'byung ba|<term> dependent arising, dependent origination (Skt: pratītya­samutpāda): A key term for Buddhist philosophy that represents the basic Buddhist understanding of causal processes. Inpratītya-samutpāda, a compound of two terms,samutpādameans “arisin” or “coming into existence” and poses little interpretive difficulty. The preverbsam- is sometimes understood as meaning “together” (samavāyena), referring to the doctrine that no entity whatsoever arises on its own—ultimately existent bits of materiality always arise with other bits, and moments of mind are always accompanied by mental states. Thesgra sbyor bam po gnyis pacommentary on theMahāvyutpatti, however, clarifies that the Tibetan translation has'brel parin the sense of “connection,” a rendering ofsambandharesulting from an interpretation of thesam- as indicating connection (sam ni sambandha stes 'brel pa la bya). The first part of the compound,pratītya, can be explained in two very different ways, which have occasioned lengthy debates at the crossroads of philosophy and grammar. According to one explanation, it would mean “things that are each bound to go, to vanish,” hence the whole expression would mean something like “the arising of things that are each bound to vanish,” i.e., the arising of impermanent things. This explanation is favored, for example, by Bhāviveka, and Candrakīrti criticizes him for it (see Macdonald 2015, pp. 121–32). It is also the one opted for by Vīryaśrīdatta in theNibandhanacommentary onDistinctly Ascertaining the Meanings(see Samtani 1971, p. 98). The other interpretation takespratītyaas meaning “having obtained” or “having depended upon,” more flexibly also “depending,” i.e., without necessarily implying temporal succession of two activities by the same entity, which is problematic, as the entity cannot be easily expected to do something (even “depending”) before it has come intoexistence(unless one is a Vaibhāṣika who acceptsexistenceof future entities). In this interpretation, the sense of the whole expression is expanded as “arising in dependence upon an assemblage of causes and conditions.” This interpretation seems to be prevalent, and hence it has been followed in the translation (it is also the basis for the Tibetan rendering asrten cing 'brel par 'byung ba). It has the distinct advantage of matching the only possible sense ofpratītyawhen it appears outside of a compound in sūtra passages where the dependent arising of, say, eye consciousness is described. A long discussion of the proper sense and the two interpretations of the termpratītyasamutpādacan be found in chapter 3 of theAbhidharmakośabhāṣya(Pradhan 1967, p. 138). We find numerous different explanations of dependent arising in the Buddhist texts, but three of them are most prominent: a short general definition of contingent coming intoexistence, as “A being there, B exists; from the arising of A, B arises”; the example of the arising of a single momentary entity, as “depending upon visible form and the eye faculty, eye consciousness arises”; and lastly the process of causality known as “dependent arising with twelve parts,” which describes the birth, complete life cycle, death, and rebirth of a sentient being in the desire realm (the part of the universe where we live and where several classes of sentient beings are born from a womb). The twelve parts of dependent arising are often distributed into three lifetimes: ignorance and assembled factors belong to the previous lifetime; consciousness, name-and-form, the six entrances, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, and existence belong to the present lifetime; and birth and decay-and-death belong to the future lifetime (seeAbhidharmakośabhāṣya3.25, Pradhan 1967, pp. 133–34). This explanation allows one to make good sense of the frequent sequence, found in the sūtras, where first dependent arising is explained, and then it is said to vanquish all views regarding past, present, or future lives (this progression is also found in theMūlamadhyamakakārikā;see Salvini 2011).

In general, the processes of cyclic existence, through which the external world and the sentient beings within it revolve in a continuous cycle of suffering, propelled by the propensities of past actions and their interaction with afflicted mental states, originate dependent on the sequential unfolding of twelve links: (1) fundamental ignorance, (2) formative predispositions, (3) consciousness, (4) name and form, (5) sense field, (6) sensory contact, (7) sensation, (8) craving, (9) grasping, (10) rebirth process, (11) actual birth, (12) aging and death. It is through deliberate reversal of these twelve links that one can succeed in bringing the whole cycle to an end.

The other set, common to Prajñāpāramitā literature, charts the progress of an individual practitioner who, starting from the level of an ordinary person, sequentially follows the path of a śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and then a bodhisattva on their way to complete buddhahood. The first three levels pertain to an ordinary person preparing themselves for the path; the next four (4-7) chart the path of a śrāvaka; level eight aligns with the practices of a pratyekabuddha; level nine refers to the path of bodhisattvas; and finally, level ten is the attainment of buddhahood.

sems bskyed|<term> mind set on awakening (Skt: bodhicitta): In the general Mahāyāna teachings, bodhicitta, the mind of awakening, is the intention or the strong aspiration to attain awakening for the sake of all sentient beings. Its two aspects on the relative level of truth are famously summarized in Śāntideva'sBodhicaryāvatāra(chapter 1, verses 15, 16): “Bodhichitta, the awakened mind, is known in brief to have two aspects: First, aspiring, bodhichitta in intention; Then active bodhichitta, practical engagement. These correspond to the wish to go and then actually setting out.” On the level of absolute truth, bodhicitta is the realization of emptiness or the awakened mind itself.

sems can chen po|<term> mahāsattva (Skt: mahāsattva): Later commentarial writings do nevertheless define the term—variably—in terms of bodhisattvas having attained a particular level (bhūmi) or realization. The most common qualifying criteria mentioned are attaining the path of seeing, attaining irreversibility (according to its various definitions), or attaining the seventh bhūmi.
sems can chen po|<term> mahāsattva (Skt: mahāsattva): The term can be understood to mean “great courageous one” or "great hero,” or (from the Sanskrit) simply “great being,” and is almost always found as an epithet of “bodhisattva.” The qualification “great” in this term, according to the majority of canonical definitions, focuses on the generic greatness common to all bodhisattvas, i.e., the greatness implicit in the bodhisattva vow itself in terms of outlook, aspiration, number of beings to be benefited, potential or eventual accomplishments, and so forth. In this sense themahā-(“great”) is close in its connotations to themahā-in “Mahāyāna.” While individual bodhisattvas described asmahāsattvamay in many cases also be “great” in terms of their level of realization, this is largely coincidental, and in the canonical texts the epithet is not restricted to bodhisattvas at any particular point in their career. Indeed, in a few cases even bodhisattvas whose path has taken a wrong direction are still described asbodhisattva mahāsattva.

sems dpa' chen po|<term> great being, great spiritual hero, mahāsattva (Skt: mahāsattva): Later commentarial writings do nevertheless define the term—variably—in terms of bodhisattvas having attained a particular level (bhūmi) or realization. The most common qualifying criteria mentioned are attaining the path of seeing, attaining irreversibility (according to its various definitions), or attaining the seventh bhūmi.
sems dpa' chen po|<term> great being, great spiritual hero, mahāsattva (Skt: mahāsattva): The term can be understood to mean “great courageous one” or "great hero,” or (from the Sanskrit) simply “great being,” and is almost always found as an epithet of “bodhisattva.” The qualification “great” in this term, according to the majority of canonical definitions, focuses on the generic greatness common to all bodhisattvas, i.e., the greatness implicit in the bodhisattva vow itself in terms of outlook, aspiration, number of beings to be benefited, potential or eventual accomplishments, and so forth. In this sense themahā-(“great”) is close in its connotations to themahā-in “Mahāyāna.” While individual bodhisattvas described asmahāsattvamay in many cases also be “great” in terms of their level of realization, this is largely coincidental, and in the canonical texts the epithet is not restricted to bodhisattvas at any particular point in their career. Indeed, in a few cases even bodhisattvas whose path has taken a wrong direction are still described asbodhisattva mahāsattva.

shes rab|<term> consort (female) (Skt: mudrā, prajñā, rati, vidyā, yoṣitā): The female element of the coupling pair in sexual yoga. In this translation the term “consort” has been used to render different terms with slighty different concepts of thefemale consort, the most important being mudrā, vidyā, and prajñā.

shes rab|<term> discernment, discriminating wisdom, insight, knowledge, knowledge of the Dharma, prajñā, transcendent awareness, wisdom (Skt: prajñā): The termprajñāis formed by adding the prefixpra, usually understood as meaning “excellent,” to the rootjñā, meaning “to know,” “to know of,” “to understand,” “to cognize,” “to be aware of,” etc.Prajñāis used in more mundane contexts as referring to something very akin to “wisdom,” while in a Buddhist context it is often defined asdharma-pravicaya, the classification or analysis of entities, predicated upon a recognition of their specific nature. It is thus also a synonym ofabhidharmaand of “insight” or “clear sight” (vipaśyanā).
shes rab|<term> discernment, discriminating wisdom, insight, knowledge, knowledge of the Dharma, prajñā, transcendent awareness, wisdom (Skt: prajñā): In this textshes rabseems to mean primarilyknowledge(defined as insight and understanding one has gained through studying and experience), specificallyknowledgeof the teachings of the Buddha in general, and of karmic cause and effect in particular (Cf. Edgerton, BHSD, s.v.prajñā: “(Skt., and Pālipaññā),knowledge: three kinds,śrutamayī,cintāmayī, andbhāvanāmayī”, i.e.,knowledgeconsisting in listening to the teachings, reflecting on them, and meditation (cultivating or internalizing the teachings).

shes rab|<term> discernment, discriminating wisdom, insight, knowledge, knowledge of the Dharma, prajñā, transcendent awareness, wisdom (Skt: prajñā): In the context‌ of the perfections, wisdom is the sixth of the six perfections. The translation ofprajñā(shes rab) by “wisdom” here defers to the precedent established by Edward Conze in his writings. It has a certain poetic resonance which more accurate renderings—“discernment,” “discriminative awareness,” or “intelligence”—unfortunately lack. It should be remembered that in Abhidharma,prajñāis classed as one of the five object-determining mental states (pañcaviṣayaniyata,yul nges lnga), alongside “will,” “resolve,” “mindfulness,” and “meditative stability.” Following Asaṅga'sAbhidharmasamuccaya, Jamgon Kongtrul (TOK, Book 6, Pt. 2, p. 498), definesprajñāas “the discriminative awareness that analyzes specific and general characteristics.” Therefore “wisdom” in this context is to be understood in the cognitive or analytical Germanic sense ofwitanorweis(Dayal 1932: p. 136) and not as an abstract “body of knowledge,” or in any aloof and mysterious theosophical sense. Nor indeed is there any association with the Greeksophia. Also translated here as “discriminative awareness.” See also “perfection of wisdom.”

thams cad mkhyen pa|<term> all-knowing, All-Knowing One, omniscience, omniscient, Omniscient One (Skt: sarvajña, sarvajñatā): This refers to the gnosis of the Buddha, with which there is nothing he does not know. However, not to confuse “omniscience” with the theistic conception of an omniscient god, the “everything” here is specifically everything about the source of the predicament of worldly life and the way of transcendence of that world through liberation. Since “everything” is only an abstract term without any particular referent, once we are clear about the implications of infinity, it does not refer to any sort of ultimate totality, since a totality can only be relative, i.e., a totality within a particular frame of reference.

For our use of “effort” (samyakpradhāna) instead of lit. “abandonment” (samyakprahāna) see Dayal, p. 102 ff. These four form a part of the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment.

The four correct exertions are (1) preventing negative states of mind from arising, (2) removing those that have already arisen, (3) giving rise to positive states that have not yet arisen, and (4) maintaining those that have already arisen. While the translation of this term here follows the Sanskrit, a literal translation from Tibetan would be “four correct abandonings,” a rendering often seen. It is possible that the Tibetan translators may originally have confused the meaning in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit (BHS) of the termprahāṇa(“priority”) with its meaning in classical Sanskrit (“elimination”).

Exertion is in accordance with the meaning in Buddhist Sanskrit. The Tibetan is translated as “abandonment” as in classical Sanskrit, which does not fit the context.

These are among the thirty-sevenfactors of awakening. The term is often translated “true relinquishments,” which is the literal meaning of both the Sanskrit and Tibetan, but does not fit the third and fourth; Dayal, p. 102 ff. suggests the use of “effort” (samyakpradhāna) instead of lit. “abandonment” (samyakprahāna).

The Sanskrit termsamyakprahāṇais generally translated as either "right exertion(s)” or “right abandonment(s),” depending on whether one follows the primary connotation “exertion” (pradhāna, lit. “priority”) or the secondary (nirukta) derived connotation “abandonment” (prahāṇa). The four are the intention to not do bad actions that have not been done, to give up bad actions that are being done, to do good actions that have not been done, and to increase the good actions that are being done.

ye shes|<term> awareness, gnosis, knowing, knowledge, primordial wisdom, transcendental knowledge, wakefulness, wisdom (Skt: jñāna): Although the Sanskrit termjñānacan refer to knowledge in a general sense, it is often used in Buddhist texts to refer to the mode of awareness of a realized being. In contrast to ordinary knowledge, which mistakenly perceives phenomena as real entities having real properties, wisdom perceives the emptiness of phenomena, their lack of intrinsic essence.
ye shes|<term> awareness, gnosis, knowing, knowledge, primordial wisdom, transcendental knowledge, wakefulness, wisdom (Skt: jñāna): This term denotes the mode of awareness of a realized being. Although all sentient beings possess the potential for actualizing transcendentalknowledgewithin their mind streams, mental obscurations make them appear instead as aspects of mundane consciousness. Also known as “pristine awareness,” “primordialwisdom,” “primordial awareness,” “gnosis,” or the like.
ye shes|<term> awareness, gnosis, knowing, knowledge, primordial wisdom, transcendental knowledge, wakefulness, wisdom (Skt: jñāna): The termjñānais formed by the rootjñā, meaning “to know,” “to know of,” “to understand,” “to be aware of,” with the addition of thepratyaya lyuṭ, which can be interpreted as having different values (the instrument of awareness, its agent, or the action of awareness). We have chosen “awareness” as it was the only that seemed to fit for two important (and not unrelated) contexts whereinjñānais used: awareness of something, and nonobjective, nonconceptual awareness. In Tibetan the two senses are sometimes distinguished by usingshes paandye shes, respectively, but the distinction in the usage of these two terms is not clearly marked in works that are translations from the Sanskrit, and hence it is less relevant for the Kangyur than it may be for indigenous Tibetan works. The nature ofjñānaand its relationship with “wisdom” (prajñā) is the topic of one of the chapters of theAbhidharmakośaand is also thematized in a number of Mahāyāna sūtras and śāstras.

In this way the actions thus dedicated contribute to the purpose of attaining enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings.
yongs su bsngo ba|<term> dedication, dedication of merit (Skt: pariṇāma, pariṇāmana, pariṇata): This refers to the bodhisattva's constant mindfulness of the fact that all his actions of whatever form contribute to his purpose of attaining enlightenment for the sake of himself and others, i.e., his conscious deferral of the merit accruing from any virtuous action as he eschews immediate reward in favor of ultimate enlightenment for himself and all living beings.
yongs su bsngo ba|<term> dedication, dedication of merit (Skt: pariṇāma, pariṇāmana, pariṇata): Although the Sanskrit termpariṇāmanāis often translated as “dedication” (as in the practice of dedicating merit), the term has the basic meaning of “transforming,” “developing,” “making ripen.” This conception, then, reflects the Buddhist understanding that the act of dedication involves mentally or ritually directing the merit (puṇya) produced from virtuous activity toward a specific goal, be it worldly or transworldly. In this text, we can observe that the idea of dedication is closely linked with the idea of karmic ripening or maturation (vipaka). It is also noteworthy that dedication can be wrongly practiced, as when the text speaks of six perfections that are dedicated through wrong view ().

In standard classifications, such as the one in theAbhidharmakośa, it is ranked as the fourth of the six counting from below. This god realm is where all future buddhas are said to dwell before taking on their final rebirth prior to awakening. There, the Buddha Śākyamuni lived his preceding life as the bodhisattva Śvetaketu. When departing to take birth in this world, he appointed the bodhisattva Maitreya, who will be the next buddha of this eon, as his Dharma regent in Tuṣita. For an account of the Buddha's previous life in Tuṣita, seeThe Play in Full(Toh 95),2.12, and for an account of Maitreya's birth in Tuṣita and a description of this realm, seeThe Sūtra on Maitreya's Birth in the Heaven of Joy, (Toh 199).

It is only at the end of life that these cease, and since no new aggregates arise, the arhat or buddha is said to attainparinirvāṇa, meaning “complete” or “final” nirvāṇa. This is synonymous with the attainment of nirvāṇa without remainder (anupadhiśeṣanirvāṇa).
