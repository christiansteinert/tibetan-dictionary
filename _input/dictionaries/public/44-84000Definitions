These elements are usually believed to be in principle invisible; all primary rūpa (“form/materiality”) is in principle invisible, while visibility is a type of secondary rūpa, which depends on the four great elements but is not to be confused with them.

This term may also refer to composite objects or conditioned things in the generic sense.
'du byed|This term denotes the deep-seated predispositions inherited from past actions and experiences, some of which function in association with mind, while others do not. Karmic predispositions are critical to the Buddhist understanding of the causal dynamics of karma and conditioning. It is the collection of such countless predispositions by afflicted mental states that constitutes the obscuration of misconceptions concerning the known range of phenomena, the total eradication of which occurs only when full awakening or buddhahood is achieved.
'du byed|In its most general usage this term refers to any phenomenon has been formed, conditioned, or dependently brought into being. It is this broad use of the term that is used in the Bhava saṅkrānti sūtra when King Bimbisāra asserts that “formations are empty” ( https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-063-007.html#UT22084-063-007-52 ). The same term is also used to describe the second of the twelve links of dependent origination (pratītya samutpāda) and also the fourth of the five aggregates, where the term has a more specific usage related to those teachings.

'du byed|The Sanskrit term saṃskāra varies according to context. It literally means something that “causes aggregation” or “causes to be put together.” In a general sense it refers to any phenomenon that comes into being on the basis of causes and conditions. In more specific usage it is also the term describing the fourth of the five aggregates and the second of the twelve links of dependent origination. Although both of these latter uses have their own technical contexts, in both cases the term carries a more active and volitional aspect and refers to the formative factors, mental volitions, and other supporting factors that perpetuate birth in saṃsāra.

'du shes|One of the five aggregates, sometimes also called “recognition” or “discrimination,” this refers to the discriminative power of the mind in relation to objects.
'du shes|The term is used in an ordinary sense in Sanskrit to mean “notion,” “sign,” “conception,” “clear understanding.” It is also used more specifically in Buddhist scholastic contexts in the phrase “the aggregate of perceptions” (saṃjñāskandha).
'du shes|Often this term is translated as “perception” or “discrimination” when it is included as the third of the five aggregates, in which case it refers to the mental function of differentiating and identifying objects according to their qualities. Thus it does not refer to the perceptions of the senses but to the conceptual notions or labels that are ascribed to sense perceptions before they may be conceived by the rational mind. In this sense, they are not really concepts or thoughts either, but rather the fundamental units ascribed to phenomena by the dualistic mind in order to form conceptual thoughts about them. Thus we have translated this as a “notion,” as the verses of the Bhava saṅkrānti sūtra emphasize the insubstantiality of the names as mere notions ascribed to phenomena, which exist as nothing other than a designation imputed by the mind.

'jam dpal gzhon nur gyur pa|Mañjuśrī is one of the eight “close sons” of the Buddha and a bodhisattva that embodies insight. He is a major figure in the Mahāyāna sūtras, appearing often as an interlocutor of the Buddha, as in the case of this text. In his most well-known iconographic form, he is portrayed bearing the sword of insight in his right hand and a volume of the Prajñā pāramitā sūtra in his left. In addition to the epithet Kumārabhūta, which means “having a youthful form,” Mañjuśrī can also take on the epithets Mañjughoṣa, Mañjusvara, and Pañcaśikha.
'jam dpal gzhon nur gyur pa|The eternally youthful crown prince (kumārabhūta), so called because of his special identification with the Prajñā pāramitā, or Transcendence of Wisdom. He is the only member of the Buddha’s retinue who volunteers to visit Vimalakīrti, and he serves as Vimalakīrti’s principal interlocutor throughout the sūtra.

'jam dpal gzhon nur gyur pa|Evolved from the gandharva Pañcaśikha in early Buddhism, which remains one of Mañjuśrī’s alternate names. Pañcaśikha was a gandharva who lived on a five-peaked mountain, and who brought the Buddha information on what was occuring in the paradises. Mañjuśrī is the first prominent bodhisattva after Maitreya in the early Mahāyāna sūtras, where he is known as Mañjughoṣa (“Having a Beautiful Voice”). He came to embody wisdom, and became one of the eight great bodhisattvas. In the early tantras he was the lord of one of the three buddha families. In the Sanskrit version of the sūtra, Kumārabhūta is a separate word rather than a compound with his proper name. This means that it could be the second of his names, and it is glossed as meaning “always young.” Alternatively it could be treated simply as an adjective, as in “the youth Manjuśrī.”

'jig tshogs la lta ba'i ri'i rtse mo mthon po nyi shu|“The body is not the self nor does the self have a body; / The self is not based on the body [n]or body on self. / Know that these four relations apply to all skandhas; / So these are considered the twenty views of self.” (Goldfield 387).
'jig tshogs la lta ba|The Tibetan literally means “the view of the perishing collection,” referring to regarding the collection of aggregates that are momentary and transitory as a self.
'jig tshogs la lta ba|First of the three fetters; also third of the five fetters associated with the lower realms, which concerns the superimposition of the notion of self upon the five psycho-physical aggregates.
'jig tshogs la lta ba|View that posits true reality in a person by taking one or more of the five aggregates to consist in a single, lasting, and autonomously existing entity (self). Also known as the view of the transitory collection.
'jig tshogs la lta ba|The Tibetan is literally “the view of the destructible collection,” and the Sanskrit is “the view of the existing body.” Both refer to a view that identifies the existence of a self in relation to the five aggregates.
'jig tshogs la lta ba|The Sanskrit term means “the view that the body is real,” the Tibetan term can be translated as “the view of the perishing collection,” and the Chinese translates as “the view of the body.” It refers to viewing the “perishing” collection of momentary, transitory aggregates—the body—as a self.
'jig tshogs la lta ba|This consists of twenty varieties of false notion, consisting basically of regarding the temporally impermanent and ultimately insubstantial as “I” or “mine.” The five compulsive aggregates are paired with the self, giving the twenty false notions. For example, the first four false notions are that (1) matter is the self, which is like its owner (rūpaṃ ātmā svāmivat); (2) the self possesses matter, like its ornament (rūpavañ ātmā alaņkāravat); (3) matter belongs to the self, like a slave (ātmīyaṃ rūpaṃ bhṛtyavat); and (4) the self dwells in matter as in a vessel (rūpe ātmā bhajanavat). The other four compulsive aggregates are paired with the self in the same four ways, giving sixteen more false notions concerning sensation, intellect, motivation, and consciousness, hypostatizing an impossible relationship with a nonexistent, permanent, substantial self.
'jig tshogs spong byed|A temple on Mount Gośṛṅga.
'jig tshogs|Object of egoistic or materialist interest (satkāyadṛṣṭi). See “egoistic views.”
'jig tshogs|The Tibetan is literally “the destructible aggregation,” and the Sanskrit is “the existing body.” It implies the view that identifies the existence of a self in relation to the skandhas. Thhe term is also translated here as “destructible accumulation.”
'jig tshogs|The transitory collection of the five aggregates, which is the basis for the view of a self or that which belongs to a self. The term {'jig tshogs} (“transitory collection”; Skt. satkāya, literally “real assemblage”) here alludes to the belief in a real person (satkāyadṛṣti) or, more specifically, the view that the aggregates constitute a real person. This is typically denounced as a false view in Buddhism. However, this text makes the radical claim that beginners should be taught not to reject the composite person because, as becomes clear, there is, quite literally, nothing there to reject.

'khor los sgyur ba'i rgyal po|The concept of the benign universal monarch or emperor who rules in accordance with the law of the sacred teachings of Buddhism is one that has permeated Buddhist literature since the time of A śoka.

'khor los sgyur ba'i rgyal po|The term “universal monarch” denotes a just and pious king who rules over the universe according to the laws of Dharma. Such a monarch is called a cakravartin because he wields a disk (cakra) that rolls (vartana) over continents, worlds, and world systems, bringing them under his power. A universal monarch is often considered the worldly, political correlate of a buddha.
'khor los sgyur ba'i rgyal po|A ruler of one of the continents, possessing the mark of a wheel on the soles of his feet as a sign of his authority (Rigzin 38).

'khor los sgyur ba'i rgyal po|An ideal monarch or emperor who rules in accordance with the Dharma over the entire universe or large parts of it (whatever the spatial extent of the known universe at a given time is conceived to be). A world system can have only one universal monarch at one given time, just as it can have only one buddha. Like a buddha, a universal monarch possesses the thirty-two major marks of a great being (Skt. mahā puruṣa lakṣaṇa), and in addition he possesses seven precious objects: his magical wheel or disc, an elephant, a horse, a wish-fulfilling gem, a queen, a treasurer, and a counselor. He rules on the basis of ten royal qualities (Skt. rājadharma): generosity, ethical conduct, nonattachment, honesty, gentleness, austerity, non-anger, nonviolence, patience, and tolerance.
'khor los sgyur ba|Apart from the standard meaning of a universal emperor or wheel-turning monarch, this term, often along with “tathāgata,” is used as an epithet describing a class of mantra deities also referred to as “uṣṇīṣa kings.”
'khor los sgyur ba|A just and pious king who rules over the universe according to the laws of Dharma. Such a monarch is called a cakravartin because he wields a disk (Skt. cakra) that rolls (Skt. vartana) over continents, worlds, and world systems, bringing them under his power.
'khor los sgyur ba|An epithet for any great king, but especially those of the higher classes of beings, such as vidyādharas. When referring to a specific class of Buddhist deities, the term is left in its Sanskrit form; elsewhere the term has been translated as “wheel-turning monarch” or “emperor.”
'khor los sgyur ba|A term for an idealized, utopic vision of kingship in South Asian cultures. A cakravartin reigns over vast regions of the universe in accordance with principles of righteous law ( dharma ). Such a king is called a cakravartin because he possesses a wheel or discus (cakra) that rolls across different realms and brings them all under his power.
'khor los sgyur ba|The term “universal monarch” denotes a just and pious king who rules over the universe according to the laws of Dharma. Such a monarch is called a cakravartin because he wields disc (cakra) that rolls (vartana) over continents, worlds, and world systems, bringing them under his power. A universal monarch is often considered the secular, political correlate of a buddha.
'khor los sgyur ba|A cakravartin is a king who rules over at least one continent and gains his territory by the rolling of his magic wheel over the land. Therefore he is called a king with the revolving wheel. This is as the result of the merit he has accumulated in previous lifetimes. An illustrative passage about the cakravartin and his wheel can be found in Toh 95, The Play in Full https://read.84000.co/translation/toh95.html#UT22084-046-001-94–https://read.84000.co/translation/toh95.html#UT22084-046-001-97 (here translated as “universal monarch”).

bcom ldan 'das ma|Also rendered as “Blessed Lady.”
bcom ldan 'das ma|The female form of the epithet commonly applied to buddhas and other awakened beings. The Sanskrit word bhaga means, among other factors, “good fortune,” “happiness,” “prosperity,” and “excellence.” The suffix -vat indicates possession. A common English translation is thus “blessed one” or “fortunate one.” The three syllables of the Tibetan translation mean that the being has “overcome” or “conquered” (Tib. {bcom}), is “endowed [with qualities]” (Tib. {ldan}), and has “gone beyond [saṃsāra]” (Tib. {'das}).
bcom ldan 'das|While the Sanskrit term simply means “fortunate,” “illustrious,” or “revered,” Tibetan hermeneutics defines the term as denoting a teacher or buddha who primordially subdues ({bcom}) the four demonic forces, possesses ({ldan}) the six attributes of greatness ({che ba'i yon tan drug}, viz: lordship, noble form, glory, fame, gnosis, and perseverance), and transcends ({'das}) all sorrow, without abiding in the extremes of existence and quiescence. Used in this text to refer to the Buddha Śākyamuni.\nAlso translated here as “Lord” (See also https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-121 ).
bcom ldan 'das|In the Buddhist context, it is an epithet of the buddhas. In Sanskrit, it literaly means “One who has bhaga,” which has many diverse meanings, including good fortune, happiness, and majesty; and more specifically to this context, it is used to define someone who as possessor of six specific qualities as well as beeing a conqueror of māras. The usual definition of the Tibetan term is {bcom} (“subdue”), referring to the subduing of the four māras; {ldan} (“to possess”), referring to the possession of the great qualities of buddhahood; and {'das} (“beyond,” “transcended”), meaning that such a person has gone beyond saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.\nIn this text, it refers to the Buddha Śākyamuni.
bcom ldan 'das|In Buddhist literature, an epithet applied to buddhas, most often to Śākyamuni. The Sanskrit term generally means “possessing fortune,” but in specifically Buddhist contexts it implies that a buddha is in possession of six auspicious qualities (bhaga) associated with complete awakening. The Tibetan term‍—where {bcom} is said to refer to “subduing” the four māras, {ldan} to “possessing” the great qualities of buddhahood, and {'das} to “going beyond” saṃsāra and nirvāṇa‍—possibly reflects the commentarial tradition where the Sanskrit bhagavat is interpreted, additionally, as “one who destroys the four māras.” This is achieved either by reading bhagavat as bhagnavat (“one who broke”), or by tracing the word bhaga to the root √bhañj (“to break”).

The Tibetan term‍—where {bcom} is said to refer to “subduing” the four māras, {ldan} to “possessing” the great qualities of buddhahood, and ’das to “going beyond” saṃsāra and nirvāṇa‍—possibly reflects the commentarial tradition where the Sanskrit bhagavat is interpreted, in addition, as “one who destroys the four māras.” This is achieved either by reading bhagavat as bhagnavat (“one who broke”), or by tracing the word bhaga to the root √bhañj (“to break”).
bcom ldan 'das|In Buddhist literature, an epithet applied to buddhas, most often to Śākyamuni. The Sanskrit term generically means “possessing fortune,” but in specifically Buddhist contexts it implies that a buddha is in possession of the virtuous qualities and wisdom associated with complete awakening. The Tibetan translation has three syllables defined to mean “one who has conquered (the māras), possesses (the qualities of awakening), and has transcended (saṃsāra, or both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa).\nIn this sūtra it is notable that Dīrghanakha does not initially show respect to the Buddha and refers to him using a more neutral register, “renunciant Gautama,” until his conversion at the end of the sūtra ( https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-074-003.html#UT22084-074-003-74 ), when he then uses the epithet “Blessed One.”
bcom ldan 'das|“Lord” is chosen to translate the title Bhagavān because it is the term of greatest respect current in our “sacred” language, as established for the Deity in the Elizabethan version of the Bible. Indeed, the Skt. Bhagavān was given as a title to the Buddha, although it also served the non-Buddhist Indians of the day and, subsequently, it served as an honorific title of their particular deities. As the Buddha is clearly described in the sūtras as the “Supreme Teacher of Gods and Men,” there seems little danger that he may be confused with any particular deity through the use of this term [as indeed in Buddhist sūtras various deities, creators, protectors, etc., are shown in their respective roles]. Thus I feel it would compromise the weight and function of the original Bhagavān to use any less weighty term than “Lord” for the Buddha.

bcom pa ma|This term is used for a female devotee of Viṣṇu ( bhagavat ), but here is used as an honorific term for a courtesan. Bhaga can also mean “vulva” and is therefore also used in that way in compounds. This English is also used as a translation for gaṇika in chapter 43 (see https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-037-007.html#UT22084-037-007-4448 ).

bdag med pa|The view that there is no self existing independent of the five psycho-physical aggregates. Also translated here as “selflessness” and “absence of self.”
bdag med pa|This describes actual reality, as finally there is no enduring person himself or thing itself, since persons and things exist only in the relative, conventional, or superficial sense, and not in any ultimate or absolute sense. To understand Buddhist teaching correctly, we must be clear about the two senses (conventional/ultimate, or relative/absolute), since mistaking denial of ultimate self as denial of conventional self leads to nihilism, and mistaking affirmation of conventional self as affirmation of ultimate self leads to absolutism. Nihilism and absolutism effectively prevent us from realizing our enlightenment, hence are to be avoided.
bdag med|The absence of any enduring, singular, or independent essence in individuals or phenomena.
bdag med|The Buddhist view that there is no self in persons or phenomena that exists independently of the five psycho-physical aggregates.

bdag tu 'du shes|Third of the four misconceptions; the mistaken notion of a self existing independent of the five psycho-physical aggregates.
bdag|It is crucial to understand what is meant by “self,” before one is able to realize the all-important “absence of self.” Before we can discover an absence, we have to know what we are looking for. In Mahāyāna, there is a self of persons and a self of things, both presumed habitually by living beings and hence informative of their perceptions. Were these “selves” to exist as they appear because of our presumption, they should exist as substantial, self-subsistent entities within things, or as the intrinsic realities of things, or as the intrinsic identities of things, all permanent, unrelated and unrelative, etc. The nondiscovery of such “selves” within changing, relative, interdependent persons and things is the realization of ultimate reality, or absence of self.

bde bar gshegs pa|One of the standard epithets of the Buddha Śākyamuni and other buddhas. According to Buddhaghoṣa, the term means that the way the Buddha went (Skt. gata) is good (Skt. su), and where he went (gata) is good (su).
bde bar gshegs pa|“One who fares well” or “one who is free from care.” Sometimes interpreted as “one gone to bliss.” The {su} or {bde bar} is adverbial, and gata, a past passive participle, denotes a state of being rather than literal motion and refers to a present state rather than a past one.
bde bar gshegs pa|An epithet applied to buddhas, often interpreted to mean “one gone to bliss.” In Sanskrit the prefix su- (Tib. {bde bar}) is adverbial, and that gata denotes a state of being rather than literal motion, hence the current rendering of “well-gone one,” that is, “one who has fared well.”
bde bar gshegs pa|An epithet of the Buddha meaning “one who has gone to bliss” or, interpreting gata as denoting a state of being rather than literal motion, “one who has fared well.” The epithets Sugata and Tathāgata in this sūtra, which likely belonged to the canon of an early Buddhist school, seem to refer to the historical Buddha rather than to buddhas in general.
bde bar gshegs pa|One of the standard epithets of the buddhas. A recurrent explanation offers three different meanings for su- that are meant to show the special qualities of accomplishment of one’s own purpose (svārthasampat) for a complete buddha. Thus, the Sugata is “well” gone, as in the expression su-rūpa (“having a good form”); he is gone “in a way that he shall not come back,” as in the expression su-naṣṭa-jvara (“a fever that has utterly gone”); he has gone “without any remainder,” as in the expression su-pūrṇa-ghaṭa (“a pot that is completely full”). According to Buddhaghosa, the term means that the way the Buddha went (Skt. gata) is good (Skt. su) and where he went (Skt. gata) is good (Skt. su).
bde bar gshegs pa|The term sugata is formed by the preverb su- (“well,” “good,” “completely”) and the participle gata, from the root gam (“to go” but also “to understand”). A recurrent explanation offers three different meanings for su- that are meant to show the special qualities of accomplishment of one’s own purpose (svārthasampat) for a complete buddha. Thus, the Sugata is “well” gone, as in the expression su-rūpa (“having a good form”); he is gone “in a way that he shall not come back,” as in the expression su-naṣṭa-jvara (“a fever that has utterly gone”); he has gone “without any remainder” as in the expression su-pūrṇa-ghaṭa (“a pot that is completely full”). These three senses of su- distinguish the Buddha from non-Buddhist practitioners who are free of desirous attraction (bāhya-vītarāga), from Buddhist practitioners who are still in need of training (śaikṣa), i.e., are not liberated, and from Buddhist practitioners who have no more need of training (aśaikṣa), i.e., are liberated but have not obtained complete buddhahood (svārtha sampat sugatatvena trividham artham upādāya praśastatvārthaṃ surūpavat apunarāvṛttyarthaṃ sunaṣṭajvaravat niḥśeṣārthaṃ supūrṇaghaṭavat arthatrayaṃ caitad bāhyavītarāga śaikṣāśaikṣebhyaḥ svārtha sampadviśeṣaṇārtham, Dignāga, Pramāṇa samuccaya 1.1https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4203.html, Steinkellner 2005, p. 1; see also Prajñākaramati’s Pañjikā on Bodhi caryāvatāra 1.1https://read.84000.co/translation/toh3872.html, de La Vallée Poussin 1901–14, pp. 2–3; and Artha viniścaya sūtra nibandhana, Samtani 1971, p. 244).\nThe sgra sbyor bam po gnyis pa commentary on the Mahāvyutpatti, apart from the three explanations above, contains an additional interpretation of the preverb su-, as meaning “happiness/bliss/pleasure” (sukha), attributed to the Dharmaskandha (one of the abhidharma treatises of the Sarvāstivāda tradition); thus su-gata is understood as “one who has reached happiness” (su[khaṁ]gata): “The Bhagavat has happiness; he has heavenly happiness, since he is endowed with the untroubled dharma” ({dharmmaskandha las 'byung ba sugata iti sukhito bhagavAn / svargita avyathitadharmmasamanvAgata / tad ucyate sugata ces 'byung ste}). The commentary further explains that the Tibetan rendering {bde bar gshegs pa} is in fact in accordance with the Dharmaskandha interpretation of the term ({dharmaskandha las 'byung ba dang sbyar te bde bar gshegs pa zhes btags}), which explains why the Tibetan rendering does not seem to match the more recurrent interpretations of sugata in Sanskrit treatises. The connection with sukham can also be found in lexicographical literature (see for example Subhūticandra’s Kavikāmadhenu commentary on the Amarakośa,https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4300.html Deokar 2014, p. 121; and also the Pāli Abhidhānappadīpikāṭīkā, Saggakaṇḍavaṇṇanā, which seems to be a shortened version of the Kavikāmadhenu gloss on sugata).\nThe Pāli tradition offers a slightly different explanation, in four parts: “his way of going is good,” “he has gone to a beautiful place,” “he has gone in the right manner,” and, deriving gata not from gam but from gad (“to speak,” “to say”), “he speaks in the right manner” (sobhanagamanattā sundaraṃ ṭhānaṃ gatattā sammā gatattā sammā ca gadattā sugato Visuddhimagga, 1.134).
bde bar gshegs|One of the standard epithets of the Buddha Śākyamuni and other buddhas. According to Buddhaghoṣa, the term means that the way the Buddha went (Skt. gata) is good (Skt. su), and where he went (gata) is good (su).

In doing so, the Bhava saṅkrānti sūtra does not propose a third ontological category but demonstrates in its final verse that both the relative and ultimate truths are conceptual categories and therefore provisional to understanding the ultimate nature of reality. The conception of ultimate truth should not be misunderstood, like a finger pointing to the moon, but to arrive at its actual understanding one must transcend any dualistic notion or designation altogether.

The Tibetan translation is based on the etymology that śakra is an abbreviation of śata-kratu (“one who has performed a hundred sacrifices”).

The Tibetan translation is based on an etymology that śakra is an abbreviation of śata-kratu, one who has performed a hundred sacrifices.

In the Buddhist Avataṃsaka cosmology of innumerable (asaṃkhyeya) interpenetrating buddha realms, there are myriad Śakras (aka Indra), each presiding over his own world-system.

Specifically, this term refers to one who is on the cusp of becoming a stream-enterer (Skt. śrotāpanna; Tib. {rgyun du zhugs pa}), and is the first and lowest stage in a list of eight stages or classes of a noble person (Skt. āryapudgala). The person at this lowest stage in the sequence is still on the path of seeing (Skt. darśanamārga; Tib. {mthong lam}), and then enters the path of cultivation (Skt. bhāvanāmārga; Tib. {sgoms lam}) upon attaining the next stage, that of a stream-enterer (stage 7). From there they progress through the remaining stages of the śrāvaka path, becoming in turn a once-returner (stages six and five), a non-returner (stages four and three), and an arhat (stages two and one).\nThis same “eighth stage” also appears in set of ten levels (Skt. daśabhūmi; Tib. {sa bcu}) found in Mahāyāna sources, where it is the third step out of the ten. Not to be confused with the ten levels of the bodhisattva’s path, these ten levels mark the progress of one who sequentially follows the paths of a śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and then bodhisattva on their way to complete buddhahood. In this set of ten level a person “on the eighth stage” is similarly one who is on the cusp of becoming a stream-enterer.

Specifically, this term refers to one who is on the cusp of becoming a stream enterer (Skt. śrotāpanna; Tib. {rgyun du zhugs pa}), and is the first and lowest stage in a list of eight stages or classes of a noble person (Skt. āryapudgala).

From there they progress through the remaining stages of the hearer path, becoming in turn a once-returner (stages six and five), a non-returner (stages four and three), and an arhat (stages two and one). This same “eighth stage” also appears in set of ten stages (Skt. daśabhūmi; Tib. {sa bcu}) found in Mahāyāna sources, where it is the third step out of the ten. Not to be confused with the ten stages of the bodhisattva’s path, these ten stages mark the progress of one who sequentially follows the paths of a hearer, solitary buddha, and then bodhisattva on their way to complete buddhahood. In this set of ten stages a person “on the eighth stage” is similarly one who is on the cusp of becoming a stream enterer.

brgyad pa|A person who is eight steps away in the arc of their development from becoming an worthy one (Skt. arhat; Tib. {dgra bcom pa}). Specifically, this term refers to one who is on the cusp of becoming a stream-enterer (Skt. srotaāpanna; Tib. {rgyun du zhugs pa}), and is the first and lowest stage in a list of eight stages or classes of a noble person (Skt. āryapudgala).

bsam gtan|Generally one of the synonyms for meditation, referring to a state of mental stability. Specifically, as in this sūtra, it refers to the four dhyānas, which are responsible for rebirth in the four levels—composed of seventeen paradises—of the form realm, and the four dhyānas that bring rebirth in the four levels of the formless realm, which, though called a “realm,” has no cosmological location.
bsam gtan|Also called “(meditative) concentration,” “meditative state,” and a state of mind in which one is able to focus one’s attention single-pointedly on any suitable virtuous object without wavering (Rigzin 455). Closely related to meditative stabilization (samādhi).\nThe term “meditation” has also been used in this translation to render {sgom pa} (meditation training) and {ting nge 'dzin} (meditative stabilization).
bsam gtan|Designates both the mental state of deep concentration and the meditative practices leading to it. These states are characterized by a gradual withdrawal of consciousness from external sense data. Two broad distinctions are made: rūpāvacara dhyāna or the meditative absorption associated with the form realm, and ārūpyāvacara dhyāna or the meditative absorption associated with the formless or immaterial realm. Each of the two dhyānas is subdivided into four stages. See also “four states of imperturbability.”
bsam gtan|Meditative concentration is defined as the one-pointed abiding in an undistracted state of mind free from afflicted mental states. It is an advanced form of calm abiding, where often both calm abiding and penetrative insight may be present in perfect union. Four states of meditative concentration are identified as being conducive to birth within the world system of form, each of which has three phases of intensity. However, in the context‌ of the Great Vehicle, meditative concentration is the fifth of the six transcendent perfections.

bsam gtan|One of the synonyms for meditation, referring specifically to states of mental stability or one-pointed abiding in an undistracted state of mind free from afflicted mental states. The term also refers to the specific states of absorption of the form and formless realms. Abiding in these absorptions can cause one to be reborn into these realms, and the states themselves also seem to have a spatial correlation to the form and formless realms. In this way there are eight progressive dhyānas; the first four rūpāvacara dhyāna correspond to the form realm and the latter ārūpāvacara dhyāna corrspond to the formless realms. See also https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-060-001.html#UT22084-060-001-46 .
bsam gtan|Designates mental states of deep concentration and the specific meditative practices leading to them. These states are characterized by a gradual withdrawal of one’s awareness from external sense data. There are four meditative absorptions associated with the form realm and four meditative absorption associated with the formless realm. In the course of the four meditative absorptions associated with the form realm, the meditator gradually eliminates the five hindrances (sensuous desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt) and cultivates the seven constituents of enlightenment (Skt. bodhyaṅga). In the four meditative absorptions associated with the formless realm, the meditator gradually refines the object of the fourth meditative absorption associated with the form realm to the point of the complete dissolution of subject-object differentiation.

These holy days were called upavasatha days because it was said that the gods that were the recipients of these sacrifices would “dwell” (√vas) “near” (upa) the practitioners of these sacrifices. While sacrificial practices were discarded by Buddhists, the framework of practicing fortnightly abstinence evolved into the poṣadha observance, and in fact the term poṣadha is etymologically related to the term upavasatha.

bya ka lan da ka gnas pa|A park outside Rājagṛha where the Buddha often resided, within the Bamboo Grove (Veṇuvana). The Tibetan rendering {bya ka lan da ka} makes it clear that the Tibetans considered the kalandaka to be a kind of bird, while Sanskrit and Pali sources generally agree that it is a kind of squirrel. It is therefore likely that this word refers to the Indian flying squirrel, Petaurista philippensis.
bya ka lan da ka gnas pa|A certain place in Bamboo Gove (Veṇuvana) in Rājagṛha, the Sanskrit name meaning “dwelling place of squirrels;” it was so named by King Bimbisāra after being saved from attack by a snake there thanks to the squawking of many kalandaka—flying squirrels, Sanskrit and Pali sources suggest, but crows or other birds according to the Tibetan rendering. It is also sometimes called Kalandakanivāpa, “place where squirrels are fed.”
bya ka lan da ka gnas pa|Literally, “the dwelling place of kalandaka (birds).” A location within the Veṇuvana where the Buddha stayed. The place was given its name by King Bimbisāra after he had been saved from a snake attack there by the squawking of many kalandaka—flying squirrels, Sanskrit and Pali sources suggest, but Tibetan translations understand the Sanskrit term to refer to a kind of bird. The alternative Sanskrit Kalandakanivāpa means “where food-offerings are made to kalandakas.”
bya ka lan da ka gnas pa|A place or vihāra within the Veṇuvana (Bamboo Grove) near Rājagṛha, named because it was where birds or animals called kalandaka lived or were fed. These kalandaka had once saved King Bimbisāra from a venomous snake, and it was on his orders that they were maintained and fed at the site to express his gratitude. The Tibetan rendering {bya ka lan da ka} makes it clear that the Tibetans considered the kalandaka to be a kind of bird ({bya}), perhaps a kind of crow, while from Sanskrit and Pali sources it seems more likely to mean a squirrel. It is therefore possible that this word refers to the Indian flying squirrel, Petaurista philippensis.
bya ka lan da ka gnas pa|A woodland within the Bamboo Grove; in the Pali tradition the compound is usually interpreted as “squirrels’ feeding place,” but according to Tibetan sources kalandaka refers to a kind of bird.\nThe exact referent of the word kalandaka is contested, and its etymology is unclear (see Mayrhofer 1956, s.v.). While in the Pali Buddhist tradition the word is generally believed to refer to a kind of squirrel (see Dhammika 2015, 61 and 110), the Tibetan tradition understood {ka lan da ka} to be a species of bird that nested in the Bamboo Grove. In the Pali tradition, kalandakanivāpa is the name of a locality in or near the Veṇuvana, the Bamboo Grove north of the ancient town of Rājagṛha, in which a certain king had placed food (nivāpa) for the squirrels. According to legend, a tree spirit in the form of a squirrel had warned the intoxicated, sleeping, and unattended king that a venomous snake was approaching to bite him. Out of gratitude, the king ordered that the squirrels be fed regularly. According to Tibetan sources, King Bimbisāra of Magadha confiscated the park that was later to become the Bamboo Grove from a local landowner. The landowner, angry about the expropriation, took rebirth as a venomous snake in that park. One day, when Bimbisāra and his attendants had fallen asleep after a picnic in the park, the snake approached to bite the king. Some kalandaka birds, however, saw the snake and seized it. Their cries awoke one of the king’s wives, who then killed the snake, thus saving the king’s life. As a sign of his gratitude, Bimbisāra planted bamboo that the birds especially liked (cf. Rockhill 1884, 43–44, for a translation of the Kangyur passage relating this story). According to some Chinese sources kalandaka is the name of the person who donated the Bamboo Grove to the Buddha (for references, see Vinītā 2010, 415 and 417, footnote b). We have followed the Tibetan interpretation in our translation.

byang chub kyi sde snod|An old term for Mahāyāna corpus.
byang chub kyi sems bskyed pa|This can also be rendered by “initiation of…” because it means the mental event occurring when a living being, having been exposed to the teaching of the Buddha or of his magical emanations (e.g., Vimalakīrti), realizes simultaneously his own level of conditioned ignorance, i.e., that his habitual stream of consciousness is like sleep compared to that of one who has awakened from ignorance; the possibility of his own attainment of a higher state of consciousness; and the necessity of attaining it in order to liberate other living beings from their stupefaction. Having realized this possibility, he becomes inspired with the intense ambition to attain, and that is called the “conception of the spirit of enlightenment.” “Spirit” is preferred to “mind” because the mind of enlightenment should rather be the mind of the Buddha, and to “thought” because a “thought of enlightenment” can easily be produced without the initiation of any sort of new resolve or awareness. “Will” also serves very well here.
byang chub kyi sems bskyed|The altruistic resolve to achieve complete and perfect Buddhahood for the sake of oneself and all sentient beings.
byang chub kyi sems mi brjed pa|The name of a particular absorption.
byang chub kyi sems|The wish to attain awakening for the sake of all sentient beings; a luminous “seed” moving inside the channels; the Sanskrit and Tibetan terms are also used to denote semen.
byang chub kyi sems|Literally “the mind of awakening,” but more technically, one’s particular aspiration to become fully awakened for the specific purpose of liberating all sentient beings. This is the necessary and sufficient condition to be a bodhisattva.
byang chub kyi sems|In normative Mahāyāna doctrine, bodhicitta refers to the awakened mind both in its relative and absolute aspects. In tantric thought it is frequently used as a code word for semen in the context of its generation and manipulation in sexual yogic rites.
byang chub kyi sems|“Spirit” is preferred to “mind” because the mind of enlightenment should rather be the mind of the Buddha, and to “thought” because a “thought of enlightenment” can easily be produced without the initiation of any sort of new resolve or awareness. “Will” also serves very well here.
byang chub kyi sems|The intent at heart of the Great Vehicle, namely to obtain buddhahood in order to liberate all sentient beings from suffering. In it’s relative aspect, it is both this aspiration and the practices towards buddhahood. In it’s absolute aspect, it is the realization of emptiness or the awakened mind itself.
byang chub kyi sems|The intention or the strong aspiration to attain enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings. Its two aspects on the relative level of truth are famously summarized in Śāntideva’s Bodhi caryāvatāra (ch. 1, verses 15, 16): “15. Bodhichitta, the awakened mind, / Is known in brief to have two aspects: / First, aspiring, bodhichitta in intention; / Then active bodhichitta, practical engagement. 16. As corresponding to the wish to go / And then to setting out, / The wise should understand respectively / The difference that divides these two.” (tr. Padmakara Translation Group, The Way of the Bodhisattva, Boston: Shambala, 2011). On the level of absolute truth, mind of enlightenment means the realization of emptiness.

byang chub kyi snying po|The name for the platform under the Bodhi tree that marks the location where the Buddha Śākyamuni attained awakening. The same term is used to signify the platform under the Bodhi trees on which all tathāgatas, both in this realm and in others, attain awakening.
byang chub kyi snying po|Although it is translated as “seat of awakening” and frequently refers to the seat upon which Śākyamuni attained awakening, the Skt. term literally means “essence of awakening.” It refers to the final realization with the corollary of the realized being performing the twelve deeds of a buddha.
byang chub kyi snying po|The place where Śakyamuni Buddha achieved awakening and where countless other buddhas are said to have achieved awakening, and will do so in the future. This is understood to be located under the bodhi tree in present-day Bodhgaya, India. In some texts, the term is used to refer to a seat of awakening in other buddha realms.
byang chub kyi snying po|Haribhadra defines it as “a place used as a seat, where the maṇḍa, here ‘essence,’ of enlightenment is present.” See Lamotte, p. 198, n. 105. The main “seat of enlightenment” is the spot under the bo tree at Buddha Gaya, where the Buddha sat and attained unexcelled, perfect enlightenment. It is not to be confused with bodhimaṇḍala, “circle of enlightenment.”
byang chub kyi snying po|Bodhimaṇḍa, the “seat of awakening,” can be explained in terms of location , in which case it refers to the sphere in which the dharmakāya is realized; to Akaniṣṭha, which is the place of awakening for the saṃbhogakāya ; or to the foot of the bodhi tree at Vajrāsana, which is the site of awakening for the supreme nirmāṇakāya . In terms of realization , the “seat of awakening” refers to unsurpassable, perfect awakening.

La Vallée Poussin 1925, p. 119ff.). Adhiṣṭhāna is also used to convey the idea of transformation through exerting one’s control over objects, people, and places. The term “sovereign power” seems to cover all these shades of meaning as well as the various usages of the Sanskrit term, for example satyādhiṣṭhāna “the sovereign power of truth” and adhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭita “empowered by the sovereign power (of the Tathāgata).”

chos kyi dbyings|A synonym for emptiness, the ultimate reality, or the ultimate nature of things. This term is interpreted variously due to the many different meanings of dharma ({chos}) as element, phenomena, reality, truth, and/or the teaching.
chos kyi dbyings|Defined in the commentary as the ultimate nature of phenomena, or as the supreme amongst phenomena. Also defined as the essence of the Dharma. Dhātu can be used to mean an essential element or a realm, and so dharmadhātu is also used to mean “the realm of phenomena,” meaning all phenomena. Also translated here as “essence of phenomena.”
chos kyi dbyings|This term is interpreted variously—given the many connotations of both dharma and dhātu—as the sphere, element, or nature, of phenomena, reality, or truth. In this text it is used with this general, Mahāyāna sense, not to be confused with its rather different meaning in the Abhidharma as one of the twelve sense sources (āyatana) and eighteen elements (dhātu) related to mental perception.
chos kyi dbyings|Dharma-dhātu is a synonym for emptiness or the ultimate nature of phenomena (dharmatā). This term is interpreted variously‍—given the many connotations of dharma/{chos}—as the sphere, element, or nature of phenomena, suchness, or truth. In this text it is used with this general, Mahāyāna sense, not to be confused with dharma constituent (Tib. {chos kyi khams}), also called in Sanskrit dharma dhātu, which is one of the eighteen constituents. See also “dharma constituent.”
chos kyi dbyings|A synonym for emptiness or the ultimate nature of reality (dharmatā). This term is interpreted variously—given the many connotations of dharma/{chos}—as the sphere, element, or nature of phenomena, reality, or truth. In this text it is used with this general, Mahāyāna sense, not to be confused with its rather different meaning in the Abhidharma as one of the twelve sense fields (Skt. āyatana) and eighteen elements (Skt. dhātu), and comprising all objects of mental perception.
chos kyi dbyings|This compound is actually metaphorical in sense, with (at least) two interpretations possible because of ambiguities in the word dhātu. Dhātu as in the expression kāmadhātu (desire-realm), may mean “realm”; or it may mean “element,” as in the eighteen elements (see entry), where it is explained as analogous to a mineral such as copper. Thus the realm of the Dharma is the dharmakāyā, the pure source and sphere of the Dharma. And the element of the Dharma is like a mine from which the verbal Dharma, the buddha-qualities, and the wisdoms of the arhats and bodhisattvas are culled. This is metaphorical, as Vimalakīrti would remind us, because the Dharma, the ultimate, is ultimately not a particular place; it is immanent in all places, being the actuality and ultimate condition of all things and being relatively no one thing except, like voidness, the supremely beneficent of concepts.
chos kyi dbying|The field or nature of ultimate reality.
chos kyi dbying|The “sphere of dharmas,” a synonym for the nature of things.

chos kyi dung|One of the eight auspicious emblems. As a musical instrument, the conch is blown like a trumpet, and throughout India’s history it has been a symbol of power, authority, and auspicious beginnings. In Buddhism, the Dharma conch has been variously described to represent the Buddha’s speech, his thought or intention ({dgongs}), or the sound of his teachings—in essence the Dharma itself. The sound of blowing the Dharma conch awakens beings from their sleep of delusion and ignorance.

chos kyi sku|Dharmakāya or body of dharma refers to the Buddha’s realization of reality.

chos nyid|The nature of phenomena, in terms of their specialized relative characteristics, such as the heat of fire, the moisture of water, etc.; and in terms of their common ultimate quality, emptiness, which cannot be conveyed in conceptual, dualistic terms.
chos nyid|Lit. the “nature of phenomena,” or “phenomena themselves.” The quality or condition of things as they really are, which cannot be conveyed in conceptual, dualistic terms. Akin to other terms rendered here as thatness (tattva, {de kho na nyid}), true reality (bhūtatā, {yang dag pa nyid}), and suchness (tathatā, {de bzhin nyid}).
chos nyid|The quality or condition of things as they really are, which cannot be conveyed in conceptual, dualistic terms. Throughout Buddhist discourse this term is used both in regard to the specialized relative characteristics of phenomena, such as the heat of fire and the moisture of water, and in terms of their common ultimate characteristic, emptiness.
chos nyid|Lit. the “nature of phenomena,” or “phenomena themselves.” The quality or condition of things as they really are, which cannot be conveyed in conceptual, dualistic terms. Also rendered here as “nature” or “truth.”\nNote that the term “reality” has also been used to render terms of similar meaning such as {yang dag} (nyid), as in “limit of reality” ({yang dag pa'i mtha'}).
chos nyid|“True nature of dharmas” renders dharmatā ({chos nyid}). In dharmatā the -tā ending is the English “-ness.” The dharma is an attribute of a dharmin (an “attribute possessor”). The attribute is the ultimate, emptiness. The attribute possessors are all phenomena. So, it means “the true nature [= -ness] of the attribute [emptiness].” The issue is further complicated by the widespread use of the word dharma as phenomenon (as in “all dharmas”) and so on. In such contexts it is not a word for the ultimate attribute, but for any phenomenon.

chos|The term dharma ({chos}) conveys ten different meanings, according to Vasubandhu’s Vyākhyā yukti. In the context‌ of the present work, it may mean “sacred doctrine” (also rendered “Dharma” in this translation), the “attributes” which buddhas and bodhisattvas acquire, “phenomena” or “things” in general, and, more specifically, “mental phenomena” which are the object of the mental faculty (manas, {yid}).
chos|Among its many meanings, this term can refer to the teachings of the Buddha (when capitalized in this translation); positive actions that accord with it; an entity, which has (dhṛ) certain features through which it may be cognized (also the relevant sense in which it is used when dharmas are listed as the objects of thought); and a property or a quality (such as when discussing the Buddhadharmas, i.e., the dharmas of the Buddha, meaning his special qualities or properties).
chos|The term dharma has many different interrelated meanings: it may refer to the teaching of the buddhas, to religious teachings in general, to phenomena in general, or to the specific characteristics of an object or objects in a generic sense, among other meanings. In our translation of the Bhava saṅkrānti sūtra, we have translated this term as “phenomena,” as it is generally used in this latter sense; however, we have translated the term as “Dharma” when it specifically refers to the teaching of the Buddha.
chos|The term “dharma” ({chos}) conveys ten different meanings, according to Vasubandhu’s Vyākhyā yukti. It may mean the Buddhist teachings, the awakened qualities which buddhas and bodhisattvas acquire, phenomena or things in general, etc. In the context of this work, it was rendered as “Dharma” when it refers to the teachings, and in other contexts, rendered according to the specific meaning, namely as phenomena and qualities. See also https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-060-003.html#UT22084-060-003-8 .
chos|This term has multiple interrelated meanings. In this text, the primary meanings are as follows: (1) the doctrine taught by the Buddha (Dharma); (2) the ultimate reality underlying and expressed through the Buddha’s teaching (Dharma); (3) the trainings that the Buddha’s teaching stipulates (dharmas); (4) the various awakened qualities or attainments acquired through practicing and realizing the Buddha’s teaching (dharmas); (5) qualities or aspects more generally, i.e., phenomena or phenomenal attributes (dharmas); and (6) mental objects (dharmas).
chos|A term that predates Buddhism, Dharma/dharmas has a wide range of meanings and usages in Buddhist texts depending on context:\nAs Dharma , it is the teaching of Buddha Śākyamuni and other buddhas, preached by their followers, and transmitted in the form of scripture; or, alternatively, it means ultimate reality itself, the referent of the teaching and what is realized through it.\nAs dharmas , it is variously the different teachings given by Buddha Śākyamuni, other buddhas, and their followers; the trainings enjoined in those teachings; the positive qualities acquired through applying those trainings; mental phenomena in general; or phenomena in general or their characteristics. Often in Buddhist literature there is a play on the multiple interlinked senses of this term.

dbang po|A term with a wide range of meanings. Often refers to one or all of the five faculties (faith, diligence, mindfulness, absorption, and knowledge) that are among the https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-047-001.html#UT22084-047-001-1953 (q.v.); or to the five sense faculties; or to one of the https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-047-001.html#UT22084-047-001-1922 (q.v.).

The highest Vedic sacrifice was the horse-sacrifice ritual, and there is a tradition that Indra became the lord of the gods through performing them.
dbang po|“Faculties” is a translation meant to represent the preferred etymologization of indriya in Buddhist texts as indanti, meaning “they have power,” which is also reflected in the Tibetan translation as {dbang po}. Different lists of indriyas exist within the Buddhist texts, their common trait being that they have “power” over a specific domain of activity. For example, the five sense faculties have causal power with respect to seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching.

dben pa 'dod pa|Name of a householder, a former incarnation of the Buddha while he was a practicing bodhisattva.
dben par spyod pa|Name of a teacher in a story the Buddha tells.
dben pa|Equivalent to {med pa} (non-existent) or {stong pa} (empty), with a sense of ‘being devoid of.’
dben pa|Isolation is traditionally categorized as being of three types: (1) isolation of the body (kāyaviveka), which refers to remaining in solitude free from desirous or disturbing objects; (2) isolation of the mind (cittaviveka), which is mental detachment from desirous or disturbing objects; and (3) isolation from the “substrate” (upadhiviveka), which indicates detachment from all things that perpetuate rebirth, including the five aggregates, the afflictions, and karma.
dben pa|This may refer to either literal, bodily isolation, i.e., seclusion, or to the isolation of the mind from certain (usually undesirable) mental factors. The two senses are related, and as the relationship between the two senses is both implicitly and explicitly thematized in Buddhist texts, a single translation for both the more “outer” and the more “inner” forms of isolation is here meant to respect a clearly intended suggestion found throughout Buddhist literature. The term can also refer to conceptual isolation, i.e., discernment.
dben pa|Detachment is traditionally categorized as being of three types: (1) detachment or seclusion of the body (kāyaviveka), which refers to remaining in solitude free from desirous or disturbing objects; (2) detachment or seclusion of the mind (cittaviveka), which is mental detachment from desirous or disturbing objects; and, (3) detachment or seclusion from the “substrate” (upadhiviveka), which indicates detachment from all things that perpetuate rebirth, including the five aggregates, the kleśas, karma, etc. This last category is what is being referenced here.
dben pa|This term usually has to do with a subjective state of ‘isolation,’ ‘separation,’ or ‘withdrawal,’ rather than a metaphysical idea. The Akṣayamatinirdeśa-sūtra contains a more or less parallel discussion of {dben pa nyid} in connection with diligence: “{de la 'jug pa gang zhe na gang dge ba'i rtsa ba thams cad rtsom pa'o/ gnas pa gang zhe na. gangs sems dben pa'o}.” Jens Braarvig translates this passage: “What then is activity? Undertaking all roots of good. What then is stillness? Aloofness of thought.” (Braarvig, vol. 1, pp. 175-76; vol. 2, p. 50.) Here {sems dben pa} is glossed in the Akṣayamatinirdeśaṭīkā (of Vasubandhu or perhaps Sthiramati) as: {sems dben pa ni mi dge ba spangs pa dang dge ba rtsom pa gang la yang mi rtog pa'o}. This can be translated as, “Disengagement of one’s thought is not thinking at all about giving up the non-virtuous and undertaking the virtuous.” In any case, the term viviktatā in this context and in the Akṣayamatinirdeśa does not seem to be about emptiness, but more about a type of aloof or disengaged diligence that does not conceptualize the virtues and non-virtues of the actions undertaken.

de bzhin gshegs pa|One of the standard epithets of the Buddha Śākyamuni. The expression is interpreted in different ways, but in general it means one who has thus gone (Skt. tathā + gata) or one who has thus come (Skt. tathā + āgata). The etymology of this term remains unclear and has, over the centuries, been variously interpreted as one who understands (gata) the way things are (tathā), one who has come (gata) into the world like other buddhas of the past, or one who (gata) has gone to nirvāṇa like other buddhas of the past.
de bzhin gshegs pa|An epithet for a buddha. The Sanskrit compound may be ambiguously parsed to mean either “thus-gone one” (tathā + gata) or “thus-come one” (tathā + āgata); this concurs with the Tibetan translation with the verb {gshegs}, which can mean either “to come” or “to go.” The Sanskrit root √gam (“to go”) also often denotes the meaning “to understand,” while tathā refers to thusness, suchness, or the way things really are, so the tathāgata can be rendered as the one who understands things as they really are or who has gone to such a state.
de bzhin gshegs pa|A frequently used synonym for buddha. In Sanskrit, gata, though literally meaning “gone,” is a past passive participle used to describe a state or condition of existence. Tatha(tā) is the quality or condition of things as they really are, which cannot be conveyed in conceptual, dualistic terms, and is often rendered as “suchness” or “thusness.” Therefore, this epithet is interpreted in different ways but general implies one who has departed in the wake of the buddhas of the past, or one who has manifested the supreme awakening dependent on the reality (dharmatā) that does not abide in the two extremes of existence and quiescence.
de bzhin gshegs pa|A frequently used synonym for buddhas. According to different explanations, it can be read as tathā-gata, literally meaning “one who has thus gone,” or as tathā-agata, “one who has thus come.” Gata, though literally meaning “gone,” is a past passive participle used to describe a state or condition of existence. Tatha (tā), often rendered as “suchness” or “thusness,” is the quality or condition of things as they really are, which cannot be conveyed in conceptual, dualistic terms. Therefore, this epithet is interpreted in different ways, but in general it implies one who has departed in the wake of the buddhas of the past, or one who has manifested the supreme enlightenment dependent on the reality that does not abide in the two extremes of existence and quiescence.\nHere also used as a specific epithet of the Buddha Śākyamuni.
de bzhin gshegs pa|A frequently used synonym for buddha. According to different explanations, it can be read as tathā-gata, literally meaning “one who has thus gone,” or as tathā-āgata, “one who has thus come.” Gata, though literally meaning “gone,” is a past passive participle used to describe a state or condition of existence. Tatha (tā), often rendered as “suchness” or “thusness,” is the quality or condition of things as they really are, which cannot be conveyed in conceptual, dualistic terms. Therefore, this epithet is interpreted in different ways, but in general it implies one who has gone in the same way that the buddhas of the past have gone, or one who has manifested the supreme awakening dependent on the reality that does not abide in the two extremes of existence and quiescence.\nHere also used as a specific epithet of the Buddha Śākyamuni.
de bzhin gshegs pa|The term tathāgata is formed by the indeclinable tathā (“thus,” “in that manner”) and gata, a participle from the root gam (“to go,” but also, like all Sanskrit roots indicating going or reaching, “to understand”). According to the sgra sbyor bam po gnyis pa commentary on the Mahāvyutpatti, the Tathāgata is one who has “gone in the same way that all the past buddhas have gone” ({sngon gyi sangs rgyas rnams ji ltar gshegs zhing phyin pa}) and also “someone who has understood the nature, i.e., the tathatā, of all the dharmas, as it is” ({chos thams cad gyi rang bzhin de bzhin nyid ji lta ba mkhyen}).\nThe Nibandhana commentary on Distinctly Ascertaining the Meanings derives tathāgata from the root gad (“to speak,” “to say”) and interprets it as meaning that “he teaches the Dharma just as it is, without distortion” (tathaivāviparīta dharmaṁ gadatīti, Samtani 1971, p. 242).\nAnother explanation of the term tathāgata can be found in The Diamond Cutter Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra https://read.84000.co/translation/toh16.html: “Tathāgata, Subhūti, is explained as not gone anywhere, not arrived from anywhere; in this sense he is called the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfect, complete Buddha.” (tathāgata iti subhūte ucyate na kvacidgato na kutaścidāgataḥ tenocyate tathāgato 'rhan samyak saṃbuddha iti, Vaidya 1961, p. 88).

It is presently the abode of the bodhisattva Maitreya, who received the crown for this heaven from the bodhisattva Śvetaketu when the latter decided to take birth in the Śākya family in order to become the Buddha Śākyamuni, as described in The Play in Full (https://read.84000.co/translation/toh95.html).

dge 'dun lhag ma|One of five types of offenses a monk can incur. Second only to a defeat in severity, there are thirteen saṅgha stigmata. Offenses against the monastic vows are classed as either atonable (Skt. sāvaśeṣa; Tib. {lhag bcas}) or unatonable (Skt. nirvaśeṣa; Tib. {lhag med}). Unatonable offenses, such as defeats, entail loss of one’s monk- or nunhood while atonable offenses can be atoned for in prescribed ways, according to the severity of the offense. When a monk incurs an offense whose remnant is restored by the saṅgha, the saṅgha imposes a probation and penance during which the monk must endure a loss of status and privilege and give regular reports on his conduct. Upon completion of this period of probation and penance, the saṅgha may then reinstate the monk with full honors and privileges. There is no consensus on the exact referent of the Sanskrit term vaśeṣa or its Tibetan translation {lhag ma}, though it seems to refer to the “remnant” or “remainder” of a monastic’s precepts that persist in the wake of atonable offenses. The translation “saṅgha stigmata”—literally “saṅgha remnant”—follows Kalyāṇamitra’s gloss: a group of “saṅgha” meet to impose a disciplinary act upon an offending monk who retains a remnant of his monastic precepts (Kalyāṇamitra, folio 292.a.6–7).

Actions based on the roots of virtue will eventually lead to future happiness. The Dharmasaṃgraha, however, lists the three roots of virtue as (1) the mind of enlightenment, (2) purity of thought, and (3) freedom from egotism (Skt. trīṇi kuśala mūlāni bodhi cittotpādaḥ, āśayaviśuddhiḥ, ahaṃkāramama kāraparityāgaśceti ).

dge ba|The term kuśala can function both as a qualifier or as a noun in its own right, which makes it difficult to resort to a single translation (I have resorted to “virtue” and “virtuous”). It refers to something beneficial or virtuous and is sometimes etymologized as something that keeps badness in check (kutsitaṁ śalate); when the sense of kuśala is more akin to “skillful” or even “virtuoso,” the etymology is that it is “someone who can cut the kuśa grass” (kuśān lāti), a type of grass that is very sharp and thus requires remarkable skill to cut it without being cut in turn.

dge sbyong|The Sanskrit term literally means “one who toils,” i.e., an ascetic, and the term is applied to spiritual renunciants or monks, whether Buddhist or otherwise. The Tibetan translation of this term is {dge sbyong}, meaning “one who trains in virtue.”
dge sbyong|In Indic literature, the term śramaṇa is used to denote a spiritual practitioner who emphasizes the renunciation of worldly life for a life of austerity and monasticism. Buddhism and Jainism, among others, are considered śramaṇa traditions. The term is often used in contrast to brahmaṇa, “brahmin,” in reference to a follower of the Vedic tradition, which emphasizes a householder lifestyle as the basis for spiritual practice.
dge sbyong|A renunciate who lives his life as a mendicant. In Buddhist contexts the term usually refers to a Buddhist monk, although it can also designate a renunciant practitioner from other spiritual traditions. The epithet Great Śramaṇa is often applied the Buddha.\nThe common phrase “śramaṇas and brahmins” sometimes refers to Buddhist practitioners but can also mean any religious practitioners, the brahmins being the settled hereditary priestly caste following the ancient Vedic practices while the śramaṇas are the itinerant followers (often of kṣatriya caste) of the newer, non-Vedic spiritual trends.
dge sbyong|The word śramaṇa refers to ascetics/religious practitioners who are often distinguished from brāhmaṇa (brahmins). It seems that a common characteristic of śramaṇas was to have “gone forth” (pravrajita), i.e., to not be householders, or at least this is how the Buddhist commentarial tradition understands the term. At some point, the term also became an established way to distinguish non-Vedic ascetics from those who followed the Vedas; renunciates, not just Buddhists, could be called śramaṇa if they were not within the Vedic/brahminical fold. Thus, the term has several layers of meaning, and it was such a key term in Buddhist texts that the result of practice came also to be known as “the fruit of being a śramaṇa” (Skt. śrāmaṇyaphala, Pāli sāmaññaphala); the Buddha himself is epitomized as “the great śramaṇa” (mahāśramaṇa) in one of the most famous Buddhist verses (the ye dharmā stanza, found in colophons and epigraphy throughout the Buddhist world).\nThe term śramaṇa is formed from the root śram, most likely in the sense of “to exert oneself” (tapasi). This is reflected in the second element of its Tibetan translation ({sbyong}, which is sometimes used as a translation of abhyāsa); thus, śramaṇas are—as per the Tibetan rendering—those who exert themselves ({sbyong}) toward virtue ({dge}). The reference to virtue may be connected to an etymology found in the Sanskrit Udānavarga https://read.84000.co/translation/toh326.html and Pāli Dhammapada, according to which one is a śramaṇa if one has pacified sins (śamitatvāt tu pāpānāṁ śramaṇo hi nirucyate, Udānavarga 11.14, Berhard 1965, p. 190; {sdig pa zhi ba de dag ni/ dge sbyong nyid ces brjod par bya}, Udānavarga Tib. 11.15; Zongtse 1990, p. 127; samitattā hi pāpānaṃ samaṇo ti pavuccati Dhammapada verse 265). Commentarial literature occasionally distinguishes between this as the higher sense of śramaṇa vs. the more ordinary sense of being a śramaṇa/samaṇa “only due to having gone forth” (pabbajjāmattasamaṇo); this distinction appears in contexts where the word is together with “brahmins,” as it often happens in sūtras/suttas (yaṃ no payirupāsato cittaṃ pasīdeyyāti vuttattā samaṇaṃ vā brāhmaṇaṃ vāti ettha paramatthasamaṇo ca paramatthabrāhmaṇo ca adhippeto na pabbajjāmattasamaṇo na jātimattabrāhmaṇo cāti āha samitapāpatāya samaṇaṃ bāhitapāpatāya brāhmaṇanti Ṭīkā on the Sāmaññaphalasutta, Sīlakkhandavagga, Dīghanikāya).\nThe Kāśyapa parivarta sūtra https://read.84000.co/translation/toh87.html lists four types of śramaṇa: one who is so only in outer appearance (varṇa rūpa liṅga saṃsthāna śramaṇa), one who is hypocritical and hides their real conduct (ācāra gupti kuhaka śramaṇa), one who does everything for the sake of fame (kīrti śabda śloka śramaṇa), and one who practices genuinely (bhūta pratipatti śramaṇa).

dge slong|Although the Tibetan ({dge slong}) and Sanskrit (bhikṣu) terms usually refer to fully ordained monks, in the plural, they may encompass nuns as well. Rendering it as “mendicant” in English remains faithful to the original meaning of bhikṣu as “one who begs for alms.”
dge slong|This term refers specifically to a monk who has received ordination, the highest level of monastic initiation available in the Buddhist tradition. The Sanskrit term literally means “beggar” or “mendicant,” which refers to the fact that Buddhist monks and nuns—like other ascetics of the time—subsisted on alms begged from the laity.
dge slong|The term bhikṣu, which is often translated as “monk,” refers to the highest type among the eight types of prātimokṣa vows that make one part of the Buddhist assembly.

don rnam par nges pa|The Nibandhana commentary explains the term arthaviniścaya twice. It first states, “ ‘Distinctly ascertaining the meanings’ means classifying/analyzing the dharmas” (arthānāṁ viniścayo dharmāṇāṁ pravicayaḥ, Samtani 1971, p. 73). This interpretation equates arthaviniścaya with the key term dharma pravicaya (“classifying the dharmas”), a synonym of “higher cognition” (prajñā), “special insight” (vipaśyanā), and, importantly, abhidharma.\nThe second explanation is slightly more elaborate: “For sentient beings, by listening to this, there is an ascertainment of the meaning/purpose in manifold ways; thus, this is a name wherein the meaning corresponds” (arthasya vividhākāreṇa niścayo bhavaty etat-śravaṇāt sattvānām ity anugatārthā saṁjñā, Samtani 1971, p. 83).\nSamtani (1971, p. 57ff.) argues against taking the word artha to here signify “meaning(s),” and suggests instead that it should be understood as “topic,” “subject matter,” or “category”; thus, while Ferrari’s previous rendering would translate into English as “the determination of the meaning” (“la determinazione del significato,” Ferrari 1944, p. 588) and match our own preference, his own translation of arthaviniścaya is “compendium of categories” (Samtani 2002, p. 3). Bhikkhu Ānandajoti prefers “analysis of the topics” (Ānandajoti 2016, front cover), which also matches Norman’s preference (“analysis of the (Buddhist) topics,” Norman 1973, p. 677).\nWhile we do not think that translating as either “category” or “topic” is, per se, wrong (for, one could say, the two senses of artha as “topic” and artha as “meaning” are somewhat overlapping), the arguments offered by Samtani do not entirely convince us. One of his arguments is that dharma = “category,” and therefore, since the commentary tells us that artha = dharma, it follows that artha is a category; here our difficulty is with the premise, since we believe that here dharma means “entity” rather “category,” and indeed dharmas as entities are meanings/referents as opposed to words (śabda). Another argument adduced by Samtani is based on his interpretation of a quote from Yaśomitra, where artha is equated with viṣaya, which in turn Samtani explains as “subject matter.” However, we think that the context of that passage (Wogihara 1989, p. 23) rather strongly suggests that it is not explaining the word artha as meaning “subject matter” but rather as “object,” i.e., viṣaya as “domain,” here in the sense of the domain of sensory activity of one of the five sense faculties. Yaśomitra is here explaining the term artha appearing in the expression “objects of the sense faculties” (indriyārthāḥ, Abhidharma kośa kārikā 1.9https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4089.html).\nFurthermore, we are not entirely sure that the sense of artha in the two explanations offered by the Nibandhana is exactly the same; we think that in the second explanation it is quite possible that artha (in the singular, unlike in the first interpretation) also, or maybe even primarily, carries the sense of “purpose” or “goal” (one could say “what is meaningful,” with a bit of a stretch). It is also quite likely that different nuances of the sense of artha are implied in the commentary, which is a virtue rather than a defect in Sanskrit writing (as we understand it).\nWe opted for “meaning” for the following reasons: it has a somewhat more vague/less specified feel (to us; “ascertaining the topics” could well mean ascertaining which topics are there (rather than, in fact, ascertaining their meanings); and, also taking into account other passages where the term arthaviniścaya occurs, we think it desirable to retain at least a suggestion of the opposition between “word” versus “meaning” (śabda vs. artha), which is of crucial importance in the Buddhist tradition (“relying on the meaning rather than on the words” is one of the four reliances (pratiśaraṇa); “relying on the topics” or “on the categories” may not sound too far from “relying on the words,” let alone be its opposite. Thus, “meaning/meaningful/purpose/what has purpose” is the range of meanings that we primarily read in the artha appearing in the expression arthaviniścaya.\nThe following passages use the term arthaviniścaya in contexts that are different from our sūtra, and thus we do not claim that any of them, or even all of them taken together, should lead to a conclusive ascertainment of the meaning of artha. However, we think they may clarify our purpose in using “meaning”:\n“The awareness of all sounds of speech; the awareness of the etymological explanations; the awareness of the distinct ascertainment of the meaning/what is meaningful/what is of benefit; the avoidance of what is not of benefit/what is meaningless” (sarva ruta jñānaṃ nirukti vyavasthāna jñānaṃ artha viniścaya jñānaṃ anartha vivarjanaṁ, Samādhi rāja sūtra https://read.84000.co/translation/toh127.html#UT22084-055-001-3962; Dutt 1941, p. 18).\n“He sets aside the incoherent meaning/unconnected purpose; he is very certain in respect to the distinct ascertainment of the meanings/purposes” (asaṃsaktam artham uddharati suviniścito bhavati artha viniścaye, Śayanāsana vastu,https://read.84000.co/translation/toh1-17.html Gnoli 1978b, p. 45).\n“This is a negation of the word-meaning; the real thing is not set aside. In this way, the distinct ascertainment of the meaning should also be understood in respect to other sentences” (śabdārtha pratiṣedho 'yaṃ na vastu vinivāryate evam anyeṣv api jñeyo vākyeṣv artha viniścayaḥ, Prajñā pāramitā piṇḍārthaḥ https://read.84000.co/translation/toh3809.html of Dignāga, Tucci 1947, p. 58; Tucci here translates artha viniścayaḥ as “determination of the things,” p. 65).\n“What is the distinct ascertainment of the meaning? It is where there is a distinct ascertainment in respect to six meanings. Which six meanings? The meaning of own-being, the meaning of cause, the meaning of result, the meaning of karma, the meaning of yoga, and the meaning of occurrence” (artha viniścayaḥ katamaḥ yatra ṣaḍ arthān ārabhya viniścayo bhavati katame ṣaḍ arthāḥ svabhāvārthaḥ hetvarthaḥ phalārthaḥ karmārthaḥ yogārthaḥ vṛttyarthaś ca, Abhidharma samuccaya,https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4049.html Hayashima 2003, p. 858).

gang zag brgyad pa|A person who is eight steps away in the arc of their development from becoming an arhat (Tib. {dgra bcom pa}). Specifically, this term refers to one who is on the cusp of becoming a stream-enterer (Skt. srotāpanna; Tib. {rgyun du zhugs pa}) and is the first and lowest stage in a list of eight stages or classes of a noble person (Skt. āryapudgala). The person at this lowest stage in the sequence is still on the path of seeing (Skt. darśanamārga; Tib. {mthong lam}), and then enters the path of cultivation (Skt. bhāvanāmārga; Tib. {sgoms lam}) upon attaining the next stage, that of a stream-enterer (stage seven). From there they progress through the remaining stages of the śrāvaka path, becoming in turn a once-returner (stages six and five), a non-returner (stages four and three), and an arhat (stages two and one). This same “eighth stage” also appears in set of ten stages (Skt. daśabhūmi; Tib. {sa bcu}) found in Mahāyāna sources, where it is the third step out of the ten. Not to be confused with the ten stages of the bodhisattva’s path, these ten stages mark the progress of one who sequentially follows the paths of a śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and then bodhisattva on their way to complete buddhahood. In this set of ten stages, a person “on the eighth stage” is similarly one who is on the cusp of becoming a stream-enterer.
gang zag la bdag med par phyogs gcig shes pa|Selflessness in this context‌ implies the lack of inherent existence in personal identity and also in physical and mental phenomena. Śrāvakas are said to expound the doctrine of selflessness only in terms of the absence of personal identity, while pratyekabuddhas additionally realize the emptiness of external phenomena, composed of atomic particles. However, unlike bodhisattvas they do not realize that the internal phenomena of consciousness too are without inherent existence.

They are “pairs” because in each of the four categories one first enters the path of that stage, and subsequently attains its fruit.

gnas|In “The Chapter on Going Forth,” Kalyāṇamitra reads this as an abbreviation of “refuge instructor” (Tib. {gnas kyi slob dpon}). A “refuge” or “refuge monk” is one who has passed ten years as a monk and possesses five qualities and is thus fit to guide new monks, grant ordination, and instruction. In “The Chapter on Going Forth,” the Buddha says a monk who has been ordained five years may be considered “independent” enough to travel independently between monsoons. Though the text does not address the issue, a monk of five years ordination would not, in ordinary circumstances, acts as a refuge instructor.

grangs med pa|The name of a certain kind of kalpa that literally means “incalculable.” The number of years in this kalpa differs in the various sūtras that give it a number. Also, twenty intermediate kalpas are said to be one incalculable kalpa, and four incalculable kalpas are one great kalpa. In light of that, those four incalculable kalpas represent the kalpas of the creation, presence, destruction, and absence of a world. Buddhas are often described as appearing in a second “incalculable” kalpa.
grangs med pa|This eon is literally called “incalculable” but nevertheless has a calculated span of time and therefore, to avoid confusion, its Sanskrit name is used here. The number of years in an asaṃkhyeya eon differs in various sūtras. Twenty “intermediate eons” are said to be one asaṃkhyeya eon, and four asaṃkhyeya eons are one great eon (mahākalpa). In that case those four asaṃkhyeya eons represent the eons of the creation, presence, destruction, and absence of a world. Therefore buddhas are often described as appearing in a second asaṃkhyeya eon.

gzungs kyi snying po yon tan gyi 'gro ba thams cad kyi smon lam yang dag par 'dzin pa'i snying po|A bodhisattva mahāsattva.
gzungs|The incantations, or spells, are mnemonic formulas, possessed by advanced bodhisattvas, that contain a quintessence of their attainments, not simply magical charms—although the latter are included. The same term in Sanskrit and Tibetan also refers to a highly developed power present in bodhisattvas that is a process of memory and recall of detailed teachings, best translated “retention” in certain contexts.
gzungs|The term dhāraṇī has the sense of something that “holds” or “retains,” and as such can refer to the special capacity of practitioners to memorize and recall detailed teachings. It can also refer to a verbal expression of the teachings‍—an incantation, spell, or mnemonic formula that distills and “holds” essential points of the Dharma and is used by practitioners to attain mundane and supramundane goals. The same term is also used to denote texts that contain such formulae.
gzungs|This term has several meanings. Often it refers to a ritual incantation that usually encapsulates the meaning of a longer text. In this sense it is considered to assist in the retention of the text and imbue the one who recites it with a variety of desired powers. At other times this term carries the meaning of “holding” or “retaining,” and so it is frequently used in reference to memory and learning. In the context of this text, the term carries both of these meanings. Finally, this term can also be applied as a classificatory term to Buddhist scriptures that contain one or more such incantations.
gzungs|Literally, “retention” (the ability to remember), or “that which retains, contains, or encapsulates,” this term refers to mnemonic formulas or codes possessed by advanced bodhisattvas that contain the quintessence of their attainments, as well as the Dharma teachings that express them and guide beings toward their realization. They are therefore often described in terms of “gateways” for entering the Dharma and training in its realization, or “seals” that contain condensations of truths and their expression. The term can also refer to a statement or incantation meant to protect or bring about a particular result. Also translated here as “retention.”
gzungs|The term dhāraṇī—in some sūtras a mnemonic formula and also the ability of realized beings to retain (√dhṛ) in their transmundane memory any teachings—refers, in its most general use, to dhāraṇīs as understood in the context of the Dhāraṇī genre and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Such dhāraṇīs are divinely revealed prayer formulae that are dedicated to a particular deity and typically include homage, praise, supplication, exhortation to act, and, most importantly, the heart mantra or mantras of the deity. The specific meaning of “retention” is also present in this inasmuch as dhāraṇīs, once obtained, are never lost but stay with the person who obtained them. They function as doors (dhāraṇīdvāra) or access points (dhāraṇīmukha) to infinite qualities of buddhahood. Even shorter mantras, when they are regarded as functioning in this way, can be designated as dhāraṇī.
gzungs|The ability to remember all Dharma teachings that are heard. In other contexts, a dhāraṇi is a powerful recitation that is a precursor of mantras and is usually in the form of intelligible sentences or phrases that preserve or retain the essence of a teaching. There are two sets of “four retentions” in relation to this text. (A) As explained in the sūtra itself in chapter 24 ( https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-055-001.html#UT22084-055-001-2336 ): the retention, respectively, of teachings on composites, on sounds, on kleśas, and on purifications. (B) As explained in the commentary to the opening of the sūtra (1.2, see https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-055-001.html#UT22084-055-001-93 ): the recited dhāraṇī sentences and phrases themselves, the retention of the memory of the words of all teachings given, the retention of the memory of the meaning of these teachings, and the retention of the realization gained through meditation on that meaning.

ka la ping ka|A mythical Indian bird renowned for its beautiful call. Some dictionaries equate it with the Indian cuckoo (or other Indian songbirds), while other sources will attribute mythical qualities to it.
ka la ping ka|A bird said to have a song sweeter than any other. Sometimes said to refer to the avadavat, sometimes to the Indian Cuckoo, but used as a simile it is a reference that is partly mythical; the kalaviṅka is said to sing sublimely even before being hatched.
ka la ping ka|Several species of finch belonging to the genus Amandava, part of the Estrildid finch family (Estrildidae). They are renowned as songbirds, and in Tibetan texts the Sanskrit kalaviṅka was sometimes simply transliterated ka la ping ka, sometimes translated as khu byug, “cuckoo.”
ka la ping ka|Also called red avadavats, strawberry finches, and kalaviṅka sparrows. Dictionaries have erroneously identified them as cuckoos, and kalaviṅka birds outside India have evolved into a mythical half human bird.

ka la ping ka|In Buddhist literature refers to a mythical bird with the head of a human and the body of a bird.

The call of the kalaviṅka is also used as an analogy to describe the voice of the Buddha.
ka la ping ka|An Indian bird renowned for its beautiful song. There is some uncertainty regarding the identity of the kalaviṅka, as some dictionaries declare it to be a type of Indian cuckoo (probably Eudynamys scolopacea, also known as the asian koel) or a red and green sparrow (possibly Amandava amandava, also known as the red avadavat). Within the Buddhist sūtras, the bird is usually linked to its pleasing or striking voice. In some cases, it has also taken on mythical characteristics, being described as part human, part bird. Here it is the sixteenth of the eighty designs on the palms and soles of the Tathāgata.

ka lan da ka gnas pa|A bamboo forest near Rājagṛha.
ka lan da ka gnas|Literally, the “Squirrel Feeding Ground.” A location within the Veṇuvana where the Buddha Śākyamuni stayed. The place received its name from the many squirrels living there, being fed by humans. It should be noted that Tibetan translations misunderstand the Sanskrit term kalandaka to be a kind of bird (Tib. {bya}).
ka lan da ka'i gnas|A place where the Buddha often resided, within the Bamboo Park (Veṇuvana) outside Rajagṛha that had been donated to him. The name is said to have arisen when, one day, King Bimbisāra fell asleep after a romantic liaison in the Bamboo Park. While the king rested, his consort wandered off. A snake (the reincarnation of the park’s previous owner, who still resented the king’s acquisition of the park) approached with malign intentions. Through the king’s tremendous merit, a gathering of kalandaka—crows or other birds according to Tibetan renderings, but some Sanskrit and Pali sources suggest flying squirrels—miraculously appeared and began squawking. Their clamor alerted the king’s consort to the danger, who rushed back and hacked the snake to pieces, thereby saving the king’s life. King Bimbisāra then named the spot Kalandakanivāpa (“Kalandakas’ Feeding Ground”), sometimes (though not in the Vinayavastu) given as Kalandakanivāpa (“Kalandakas’ Abode”) in their honor. The story is told in the https://read.84000.co/translation/toh1-17.html (Toh 1, ch.17, Degé Kangyur vol.4, folio 77.b et seq.).
ka lan da ka|A grove or forest within the Veṇuvana near Rājagṛha, where Buddha Śākyamuni spent several monsoon retreats and delivered many Great Vehicle teachings. In other texts it is known as the Kalandakanivāsa or °nivāpa, the dwelling place or feeding ground of kalandaka—crows or other birds according to Tibetan renderings, but some Sanskrit and Pali sources suggest flying squirrels.

khams bco brgyad|The objects, sense faculties, and forms of consciousness that are associated with form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mental phenomena. See also “element.”
khams bco brgyad|One way of describing experience and the world in terms of eighteen elements (eye, form, and eye consciousness; ear, sound, and ear consciousness; nose, odor, and nose consciousness; tongue, taste, and tongue consciousness; body, touch, and body consciousness; mind, mental phenomena, and mind consciousness).
khams bco brgyad|The eighteen sensory elements, as listed in https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-151 , comprise (1) the sensory element of the eyes, (2) the sensory element of sights, and (3) the sensory element of visual consciousness; (4) the sensory element of the ears, (5) the sensory element of sounds, and (6) the sensory element of auditory consciousness; (7) the sensory element of the nose, (8) the sensory element of odors, and (9) the sensory element of olfactory consciousness; (10) the sensory element of the tongue, (11) the sensory element of tastes, and (12) the sensory element of gustatory consciousness; (13) the sensory element of the body, (14) the sensory element of tangibles, and (15) the sensory element of tactile consciousness; and (16) the sensory element of the mental faculty, (17) the sensory element of mental phenomena, and (18) the sensory element of mental consciousness.
khams bco brgyad|Eighteen collections of similar dharmas under which all coproduced and unproduced dharmas may be included: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and thought, plus their objects—visible forms, sounds, smells, flavors, tangibles, and dharmas—plus the consciousnesses corresponding to each of the first six. The eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and thought are the basis for the arising of consciousness, though here there is the technical sense of a prior moment in any of the six consciousnesses. The first five consciousnesses depend on the five sense faculties as their basis, while the basis for the thought consciousness can be any of the six consciousnesses but not a sense faculty. Hence thought is classified among the dhātus (“elements”) in the section meant to offer a complete list of the possible bases of consciousness, i.e., what is most frequently listed as the second set of six elements.\nThe term dhātu is explained as having the sense of an ore (gotra), like a mineral ore, hence a point of origin (ākara). The bases are the points of origin for the arising of similar dharmas. The Nibandhana commentary on Distinctly Ascertaining the Meanings explains that the order of enumeration of the eighteen bases can be explained in terms of the specific way in which different sense faculties operate within their domains or in terms of the placement (from higher to lower) of the eye faculty, the ear faculty, and so forth. The Abhidharmakośa https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4089.html explains that the teaching of the bases is for those who are of weaker abilities, since it is very detailed; it is for those who prefer special insight meditation (vipaśyanā), because it contains extensive analysis; and it counteracts a delusion of “self” that is evenly distributed between sentient and nonsentient elements, since the eighteen bases offer an analysis both of form and of mind and mental derivatives.
khams bcwa brgyad|The eighteen constituents through which sensory experience is produced: the six sense faculties (indriya); the six corresponding sense objects (ālambana); and the six sensory consciousnesses (vijñāna).\nWhen grouped these are: the eye constituent, form constituent, and eye consciousness constituent; the ear constituent, sound constituent, and ear consciousness constituent; the nose constituent, smell constituent, and nose consciousness constituent; the tongue constituent, taste constituent, and tongue consciousness constituent; the body constituent, touch constituent, and body consciousness constituent; the thinking-mind constituent, dharma constituent, and thinking-mind consciousness constituent.\nSee also “constituents.”

khams gsum|The three worlds or realms of which all universes are composed: of desire (kāmadhātu), of pure matter (rūpadhātu), and the immaterial realm (ārūpyadhātu).
khams gsum|Usually synonymous with the three realms of desire, form, and formlessness. Sometimes it means the realms of devas above, humans on the ground, and nāgas below ground.
khams gsum|The three worlds are the desire realm (kāmadhātu, {'dod khams}), the form realm (rūpadhātu, {gzugs khams}) and the formless realm (ārūpyadhātu, {gzugs med khams}). These three worlds include all of saṃsāra.
khams gsum|The three realms are the desire realm (kāmadhātu, {'dod khams}), form realm (rūpadhātu, {gzugs khams}) and the formless realm (ārūpyadhātu, {gzugs med khams}), i.e., the three worlds that make up saṃsāra. The first is composed of the six sorts of beings (gods, asuras, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, and hell beings), whereas the latter two are only realms of gods and are thus higher, more ethereal states of saṃsāra. See also three realms of existence.

khams|One way of describing experience and the world in terms of eighteen elements (eye and form, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, body and physical objects, and mind and mental objects, to which the six consciousnesses are added). It can also refer to the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind, or the six elements when space and consciousness are included with those four.
khams|The list of dhātus in the sense of “elements” comprises the four great elements (see “great elements”) of earth, water, heat, and wind, plus space and consciousness, and is a list specifically designed to describe the assemblage of conditions that makes it possible for a new moment of consciousness to arise after the last moment of consciousness at death, i.e., it is meant to explain the process of rebirth.
khams|Often translated “element,” commonly in the context of the eighteen elements of sensory experience (the six sense faculties, their six respective objects, and the six sensory consciousnesses), although the term has a wide range of other meanings. Along with the aggregates (Skt. skandha) and the sense bases (Skt. āyatana), one of the three major categories in the taxonomy of phenomena in the sūtra literature.
khams|One way of describing experience and the world in terms of eighteen elements: eye, form, and eye consciousness; ear, sound, and ear consciousness; nose, odor, and nose consciousness; tongue, taste, and tongue consciousness; body, touch, and body consciousness; mind, mental objects, and mind consciousness. These eighteen cognitive elements are listed in The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines, https://read.84000.co/translation/toh11.html#UT22084-031-002-151.
khams|In the context of epistemology, it is one way of describing experience and the world in terms of eighteen elements (eye, form, and eye consciousness; ear, sound, and ear consciousness; nose, odor, and nose consciousness; tongue, taste, and tongue consciousness; body, touch, and body consciousness; mind, mental phenomena, and mind consciousness).\nThese also refer to the elements of the physical world, which can be enumerated as four, five, or six elements. The four elements are earth, water, fire, and air. A fifth, space, is often added. The six elements are earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness.
khams|Depending on the context, may translate either: (a) Skt. mahābhūta, Tib. {'byung ba chen po}, the four “main” or “great” outer elements of earth, water, fire, air, and (when there is a fifth) space; or: (b) Skt. dhātu, Tib. khams, the “eighteen elements” introduce, in the context of the aggregates, elements, and sense-media, the same six pairs as the twelve sense-media, as elements of experience, adding a third member to each set: the element of consciousness (vijñāna), or sense. Hence the first pair gives the triad eye-element (caksur dhātu), form-element (rūpadhātu), and eye-consciousness-element, or eye-sense-element (caksur vijñāna dhātu)—and so on with the other five, noting the last, mind-element (manodhātu), phenomena-element (dharma dhātu), and mental-sense-element (mano vijñāna dhātu).

lhag mthong|An important form of Buddhist meditation focusing on developing insight into the nature of phenomena. Often presented as part of a pair of meditation techniques, the other being “tranquility” (śamatha).
lhag mthong|Refers to insight into the nature of reality or the practice of developing such insight. One of the two basic forms of Buddhist meditation, the other being meditative calm (Skt. śamatha; Tib. {zhi gnas}).
lhag mthong|Often translated as “insight meditation,” referring to the liberating insight into the nature of reality or the meditative practice of developing insight into the nature of reality. One of the two basic forms of Buddhist meditation, the other being calm abiding (śamatha).
lhag mthong|This is paired with “mental quiescence” (see entry). In general “meditation” is too often understood as only the types of practices categorized as “quietistic”—which eschew objects, learning, analysis, discrimination, etc., and lead only to the attainment of temporary peace and one-pointedness. However, in order to reach any high realization, such as the absence of a personal self, the absence of a self in phenomena, or voidness, “transcendental analysis,” with its analytical penetration to the nature of ultimate reality, is indispensable. The analysis is called “transcendental” because it does not accept anything it sees as it appears. Instead, through analytic examination, it penetrates to its deeper reality, going ever deeper in infinite penetration until tolerance is reached. All apparently self-sufficient objects are seen through and their truth-status is rejected—first conceptually and finally perceptually, at buddhahood. Thus “meditation,” to be efficacious, must include both mental quiescence (śamatha), and transcendental analysis (vipaśyana) in integrated combination.

This high resolve reaches its most intense purity when the bodhisattva simultaneously attains the Path of Insight and the first bodhisattva-stage, the Stage of Joy. The translation follows Lamotte’s happy coinage “haute résolution.”

lha|According to the Buddhist tradition, one of the five or six classes of sentient beings, specifically engendered and dominated by exaltation, indulgence, and pride. The gods are said to exist in many levels of celestial or divine realms, higher than that of the human realm, within in the desire realm (kāma dhātu), and also in the form realm (rūpa dhātu) and the formless realm (ārūpya dhātu).
lha|Cognate with the English term divine. The devas are most generically a class of divine, celestial beings who populate the narratives of Indian mythology. Devas make regular appearances in Buddhist literature at the head of the assemblies of celestial and supernatural beings who attend the teachings, interact with the Buddha, bodhisattvas and other spiritual figures, and celebrate the delivery of their sermons. In Buddhist cosmology, the devas are subdivided into numerous classes based on the specific devalokas, the “heavens” in which they reside. Traditionally there are between twenty-six and twenty-eight devalokas, divided between the desire realm (kāmadhātu), form or material realm (rūpadhātu), and formless or immaterial realm (arūpyadhātu). The state of deva is reached either through meritorious acts or the cultivation of subtle meditative states, and is therefore considered a higher mode of rebirth in comparison to rebirth among hell beings, pretas, and animals. Nonetheless, all the devalokas are within the three realms of saṃsāra and therefore transitory. Thus while the devas occupy the highest strata within the scheme of the five or six “destinies” (gati), the realms within saṃsāra where beings take rebirth, their state is still one determined by the fetters (saṃyojana) that bind one to the perpetual cycle of rebirth. Also rendered here as “gods.”

Hijra is a more recent term with a Hindustani-Urdu origin.

mdo sde|Usually refers to a discourse by the Buddha, sometimes to just a few sentences by the Buddha, or sometimes, when not referring to the words of the Buddha, any concise doctrinal statement.
mdo sde|The term "teaching" renders here {mdo sde}, which usually refers to one of the collections of sūtras in the Kangyur. However, it can also mean the text of a particular sūtra or the teachings or doctrine contained in it—which is the case in this text.
mdo sde|Literally meaning “a thread,” this was an ancient term for teachings that were memorized and orally transmitted in an essential form. Therefore it can mean “pithy statements,” “rules,” and “aphorisms.” In Buddhism it refers to the Buddha’s teachings, whatever their length, and in terms of the three divisions of the Buddha’s teachings, it is the category of teachings other than those on the vinaya and abhidharma. It is also used as a category to contrast with the tantra teachings, though a number of important tantras have sūtra in their title. Another very specific meaning is when it is classed as one of the nine or twelve aspects of the Dharma. In that context sūtra means “a teaching given in prose,” and therefore is one aspect of what is generally called a sūtra.

mdo|Literally “thread,” and generally used for pithy statements, rules, and aphorisms, on which are strung a commentary. Within Buddhism it refers generally to the Buddha’s nontantric teachings. In terms of the subdivisions into twelve aspects of the Dharma, it means the teachings given in prose.
mdo|In general Indian usage, the word for a highly condensed arrangement of verses that lends itself to memorization, serving as a basic text for a particular school of thought. In Buddhism, a scripture, in as much as it records either the direct speech of the Buddha, or the speech of someone manifestly inspired by him.
mdo|Primarily within Buddhism it refers to the Buddha’s nontantric teachings in general. Literally it means “thread.” It is also used in other contexts for pithy statements, rules, and aphorisms, on which are strung a commentary and terms of the subdivisions of a sūtra into twelve aspects of the Dharma; in that case, sūtra then means only the prose part of a sūtra.

It is also used as a category to contrast with the tantra teachings. Another very specific meaning is when it is classed as one of the nine or twelve aspects of the Dharma. In that context sūtra means “discourse.”
mdo|In Indian literature, originally an orally transmitted memorized text, often a series of central points in concentrated form, and hence, called a sūtra, which means “thread.” In Buddhism, particularly with the lengthy Mahāyāna sutras, it came to mean any teaching of the Buddha, and later specifically those that were not part of the tantra tradition, even though a number of texts with the title of sūtra are classed as tantras. In the division of the Buddha’s teachings into twelve kinds, sūtra then has the specific meaning of any prose passages within a sūtra, tantra, or vinaya text.

She pretends to do so, and the heretics, believing her story, then hire some drunkards to murder her and bury her body under a pile of flowers near the Buddha’s monastery in order to make the public believe that the Buddha has ravished and killed her. As the rumour spreads, the citizenry is at first outraged but are then led to reconsider the story told by the Buddha’s monks, who pass on their master’s advice to avoid unsubstantiated hearsay and rumors. The truth eventually comes to light when King Prasenajit sends his secret service to investigate the matter, and the true perpetrators are brought to justice. This story is found in the Sundarīsutta, Udāna 4.8.

mi 'jigs pa|The literal translation of Tibetan {mi 'jigs pa}(Skt. vaiśāradya) is “fearlessness.” Usually four kinds of confidence or fearlessness are enumerated when describing a buddha: a fully enlightened buddha is confident of having (1) attained complete, perfect enlightenment regarding all phenomena, (2) eliminated all contaminants, (3) correctly declared all obstacles to enlightenment, and (4) shown the path that actually leads to the liberation from obstacles and suffering. This sūtra, on the other hand, talks about confidence regarding the daily routines of monks and nuns and their deportment. They have confidence in their ability to faultlessly adhere to the monastic discipline in all situations because it provides a sense of protection.
mi 'jigs pa|The Buddha has four fearlessnesses, as do the bodhisattvas. The four fearlessnesses of the Buddha are: fearlessness regarding the realization of all things; fearlessness regarding knowledge of the exhaustion of all impurities; fearlessness of foresight through ascertainment of the persistence of obstructions; and fearlessness in the rightness of the path leading to the attainment of the supreme success. The fearlessnesses of the bodhisattva are: fearlessness in teaching the meaning he has understood from what he has learned and practiced; fearlessness resulting from the successful maintenance of purity in physical, verbal, and mental action—without relying on others’ kindness, being naturally flawless through his understanding of the absence of self; fearlessness resulting from freedom from obstruction in virtue, in teaching, and in delivering living beings, through the perfection of wisdom and liberative art and through not forgetting and constantly upholding the teachings; and fearlessness in the ambition to attain full mastery of omniscience—without any deterioration or deviation to other practices—and to accomplish all the aims of all living beings.

The literal meaning (“not great”) of Tib. {mi che ba}, Skt. avṛha, and Pāli aviha may be based on a folk-etymological explanation (i.e., Skt. a-bṛhat may be a faulty Sanskritization of Middle Indic aviha; see Edgerton, Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Grammar and Dictionary, vol. 2, s.v. avṛha).
mi che ba|Lit. “Slightest.” The thirteenth of the seventeen heavens of the form realm; also the name of the gods living there.

When later he felt joy toward an emanation of the Buddha, the Buddha made his ugliness disappear.

mi sgul ba|The buddha in the eastern realm of Abhiratī. The translation of his name in this sūtra differs from the usual translations, which are either {mi 'khrugs pa}, {mi skyod pa}, or {mi bskyod pa}.

mi skye ba'i chos la bzod pa thob pa|The name of a meditative state associated with the path of seeing after which a bodhisattva’s progress on the path is irreversible.
mi skye ba'i chos la bzod pa|A bodhisattva’s realization that all phenomena are unproduced and empty. This attainment is variously said to occur on either the first or eighth bodhisattva level.
mi skye ba'i chos la bzod pa|The acceptance of or receptivity to the nonorigination of phenomena. This realization is attained by bodhisattvas on the eighth spiritual level on the Path of Seeing (darśana mārga).
mi skye ba'i chos la bzod pa|The forbearance to accept and understand the non-arising of phenomena, attained by a bodhisattva on the 8th level (see https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-062-018.html#UT22084-062-018-183 ).
mi skye ba'i chos la bzod pa|An attainment of effortless insight into emptiness and the lack of birth of phenomena. This attainment only occurs on the bodhisattva levels, variously said to occur on the first and eighth bodhisattva levels.
mi skye ba'i chos la bzod pa|Bodhisattvas’ realization that all phenomena are unoriginated and empty. It sustains them on the difficult path of benefitting all beings so that they do not succumb to the goal of personal liberation. Different sources link this realization to the first or eighth bodhisattva level (bhūmi).
mi skye ba'i chos la bzod pa|Here we are concerned with the “intuitive tolerance of the birthlessness (or incomprehensibility) of all things” (anutpattika dharma kṣānti or anupalabdhi dharma kṣānti). To translate kṣānti as “knowledge” or “conviction” defeats entirely the Skt. usage and its intended sense: In the face of birthlessness or incomprehensibility (i.e., the ultimate reality), ordinary knowledge and especially convictions are utterly lost; this is because the mind loses objectifiability of anything and has nothing to grasp, and its process of coming to terms may be described only as a conscious cancellation through absolute negations of any false sense of certainty about anything. Through this tolerance, the mind reaches a stage where it can bear its lack of bearings, as it were, can endure this kind of extreme openness, this lack of any conviction, etc. There are three degrees of this tolerance—verbal (ghoṣānugā), conforming (anulomikī), and complete. See Introduction, https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-060-005.html#UT22084-060-005-19 , and Lamotte, Appendice, Note III.
mi skye ba|This refers to the ultimate nature of reality, to the fact that, ultimately, nothing has ever been produced or born nor will it ever be because birth and production can occur only on the relative, or superficial, level. Hence “birthlessness” is a synonym of “voidness,” “reality,” “absolute,” “ultimate,” “infinity,” etc.

It is a shorthand term for the five skandhas.
ming dang gzugs|Literally “name and form” means the mental and physical consituents of a being. It is a synonym for the five skandhas, with the four aggregates of the mind being called “names.” In the context of the twelve phases of dependent origination the term is also used specifically to refer to the embryonic phase of an individual’s existence where the mental aggregates are undeveloped and have only a nominal presence, and therefore are called “names.”

mkha' 'gro ma|Covers a wide range of meanings—in general a female being, not necessarily benevolent, ranging from a powerful spirit to a retinue deity in a maṇḍala. Also the name of the royal goddess in the east, see “Ḍākinī.”
mkha' 'gro ma|In the higher tantras they are portrayed as keepers of tantric teachings or embodiments of enlightenment. Otherwise in Indian culture, however, they are possibly dangerous female spirits haunting crossroads and charnel grounds, and are in Kāli’s retinue.
mkha' 'gro|A class of powerful non-human female beings who play a variety of roles in Indic literature in general and Buddhist literature specifically. Essentially synonymous with yoginīs, ḍākinīs are liminal and often dangerous beings who can be propitiated to acquire both mundane and transcendent spiritual accomplishments.

In this text, they are divided according to three types: sky dweller (Skt. khecarī), earth dweller (Skt. bhūcarī), and subterranean dweller (Skt. pātālacāriṇī).

mkhan po|A personal preceptor and teacher. In Tibet, it has also come to mean a learned scholar, the equivalent of a paṇḍita, but that is not the intended meaning in the Kāraṇḍavyūha.

mkhar rnga|Listed among Indian instruments as an hourglass drum, played in the hand, and the ancestor of the present day huḍukka, somewhat larger than the ḍamaru. See Saṅgītaśiromaṇi: A Medieval Handbook of Indian Music, edited by Emmie Te Nijenhuis, p. 549. However, Dutt describes it as a drum made of bell metal, which matches the Tibetan translation as “bronze drum,” but he may have been influenced by the Tibetan translation of chapter 30. In an earlier chapter paṇava is simply transcribed into Tibetan. An example of a bell metal drum would be the ceṇṇala, a small flat gong of bell metal that is hit with a stick and used to keep time in South Indian music. Other instruments mentioned are of the South Indian tradition.

mnyan yod|A city of ancient India, in what is now Uttar Pradesh. The name Śrāvastī is explained as being derived from the name of a sage, Śravasta, who used to live in that area (this explanation is found in the commentary Nibandhana, Samtani 1971, p. 77, and is also found in the ṭīkā on Distinctly Ascertaining the Meanings found in the Tengyur, where, however, the name of the sage is transliterated as Śravasti). Pāli sources offer three explanations for the term: one is the one just mentioned, that Sāvatthī is derived from Savattha, just like other city names (Kākandī, Mākandī, Kosambī); alternatively, it is so called because “everything is there” in terms of possible objects of enjoyment for humans; and lastly the name refers to the reply, “there is everything,” that the Buddha offered when asked about what kind of shops were there (sāvatthīti savatthassa isino nivāsaṭṭhānabhūtā nagarī yathā kākandī mākandī kosambīti evaṃ tāva akkharacintakā aṭṭhakathācariyā pana bhaṇanti yaṃkiñci manussānaṃ upabhogaparibhogaṃ sabbamettha atthīti sāvatthī satthasamāyoge ca kiṃ bhaṇḍam atthīti pucchite sabbamatthīti vacanam upādāya sāvatthī Aṭṭhakathā on the Sabbāsava sutta of the Majjhima nikāya, Mūlapaṇṇāsa). The Tibetan translation as {mnyan yod} seems to derive the first part of the name from the root śru (“to hear”) and the second part as “there is” (asti); this derivation seems to be implied in one of the explanations of the Artha viniścaya ṭīkā.https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4365.html

The five are patricide, matricide, killing an arhat, intentionally injuring a buddha, and causing a schism within the saṅgha.
mtshams med pa lnga|These five are killing one’s father, killing one’s mother, killing an arhat, wounding a buddha, and splitting a buddha’s saṅgha. They are literally called “without an interval” because they result in instantaneous rebirth in hell at the moment of death without passing through an intermediate state.

They are killing an arhat, killing one’s mother, killing one’s father, creating a schism in the Saṅgha, and maliciously drawing blood from a tathāgata’s body.
mtshams med pa'i sdig las|Sanskrit ānantarya is a short for pañcā nantaryāṇi karmāṇi. These are five grave sins which, when committed, lead one to fall immediately, i.e., with no intermediate period, into the Avīci hell after death due to their severity. Usually five are enumerated: killing one’s mother, father, or an arhat; causing dissension in the order of monks (the saṅgha); and deliberately causing a tathāgata’s blood to flow. But the exact number of items varies in different lists from two or three to five (cf. BHSD, s.v. ānantarya).

mtshams med pa|The most severe among the eight hot hell realms.

mtshan ma med pa|The absence of the conceptual identification of perceptions. Knowing that the true nature has no attributes, such as color, shape, etc. One of the three doorways to liberation.
mtshan ma med pa|Emptiness ({stong pa nyid}), signlessness ({mtshan ma med pa}), and wishlessness ({smon pa med pa}) are known as the “three doors to deliverance” (triṇi vimokṣa mukhāni) or the “three concentrations” (trayaḥ samādhyaḥ) and as a set appear in both mainstream Buddhist sūtras and Mahāyāna sūtras. See Conze 1962, pp. 59–69; Lamotte 1944, pp. 1213–15; and Deleanu 2000, pp. 74–78.
mtshan ma med pa|In ultimate reality, there is no sign, as a sign signals or signifies something to someone and hence is inextricably involved with the relative world. We are so conditioned by signs that they seem to speak to us as if they had a voice of their own. The letter “A” seems to pronounce itself to us as we see it, and the stop-sign fairly shouts at us. However, the configuration of two slanted lines with a crossbar has in itself nothing whatsoever to do with the phenomenon made with the mouth and throat in the open position, when expulsion of breath makes the vocal cords resonate “ah.” By extending such analysis to all signs, we may get an inkling of what is meant by “signlessness,” which is essentially equivalent to voidness, and to “wishlessness” (see entry). Voidness, signlessness, and wishlessness form the “Three Doors of Liberation.”
mtshan ma'i 'du shes|This refers to the conceptual designation of things using linguistic signs.
mtshan ma|Can refer both to a physical mark or trait as well as to the data of perception.
mtshan ma|Conceptual characteristics or reifications that lead to distraction and a false understanding of reality.
mtshan ma|Any imagined mark or feature of an object, the misperception of which serves as the basis of perception and the arising of coarse conceptuality. Also translated here as “mark.”
mtshan ma|A causal sign is the projected reality that functions as the objective support of a cognitive state. It cannot be separated out from the cognitive state and to that extent may enjoy a modicum of conventional reality. To “practice with a causal sign” means to look at an apparent phenomenon within accepting that it has more reality than it actually does.
mtshan ma|A sign or characteristic, which refers to the generic appearance of an object, in distinction to its secondary characteristics or anuvyañjana. Advertence toward the generic sign and secondary characteristics of an object furnishes the conception or nominal designation (Skt. saṃjñā) of that object, which may in turn generate clinging or rejection and ultimately lead to suffering.
mtshan ma|A polyvalent term, it generally refers to the characteristic features of an object or image. Nimitta can refer to features of an object that attract the mind’s attention, engage with it more deeply, and develop emotional responses to it. Such marks or features are often considered to be ultimately false and deceptive. In a more positive sense nimitta can refer to the focus of meditation practice. The term applies to both external objects and visualized images that are used to deepen meditative concentration and absorption. Also translated here as “mark” and “feature.”

mu stegs can|Religious or philosophical orders that were contemporary with the early Buddhist order, including Jains, Jaṭilas, Ājīvikas, and Cārvākas. Initially, the term tīrthika or tīrthya may have referred to non-brahmanic ascetic orders.\nSee also https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-001-001.html#UT22084-001-001-48 and https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-001-001.html#UT22084-001-001-49 .

mu stegs pa|A member of a religion, sect, or philosophical tradition that was a rival of or antagonistic to the Buddhist community in India.
mu stegs pa|A person belonging to any non-Buddhist tradition in pre-Muslim India, both those Veda-based and not. The term has its origins among the Jains.
mu stegs pa|Those of religious or philosophical orders that were contemporary with the early Buddhist order, including Jains, Jaṭilas, Ājīvikas, and Cārvākas. Initially, the term tīrthika or tīrthya may have referred to non-brahmanic ascetic orders. Tīrthika (“forder”) literally translates as “one belonging to or associated with (possessive suffix –ika) stairs for landing or for descent into a river,” or “a bathing place,” or “a place of pilgrimage on the banks of sacred streams” (Monier-Williams). The term may have originally referred to temple priests at river crossings or fords where travelers propitiated a deity before crossing. The Sanskrit term seems to have undergone metonymic transfer in referring to those able to ford the turbulent river of saṃsāra (as in the Jain tīrthaṅkaras, “ford makers”), and it came to be used in Buddhist sources to refer to teachers of rival religious traditions. The Sanskrit term is closely rendered by the Tibetan {mu stegs pa}: “those on the steps ({stegs pa}) at the edge ({mu}).”

mya ngan bsring ba|This is likely a pre-reform expression. We were unable to determine the exact meaning of this Tibetan expression, and we did not find it used elsewhere in either the Kangyur or the Tengyur. In the Dictionary of Old Tibetan Orthography (Tib. bod yig brda rnying tshig mdzod) by rnam rgyal tshe ring (2001), we find the entry {nyon mongs bzod}; one who endures hardship or suffering, as an older Tibetan expression for a monk or nun (Tib. {dge slong gi ming}). Thus, one literal translation that we are proposing for this expression is “one who sustains (or endures) suffering (or hardship).” Comparison with similar contexts in related texts (https://read.84000.co/translation/toh338.html, F.278.a) and passim, i.e., where we find {rab tu byung ba tshul dang ldan pa rnams} etc. instead, suggests that the expression may be a collective term for those who have entered the path to liberation (Skt. āryapudgala; Pāli ariyapuggala) or for the Buddhist saṅgha generally. See also “those who have entered the path of liberation.”

mya ngan las 'das pa|The Sanskrit means “extinguishment,” for the causes for saṃsāra are “extinguished.” The Tibetan means “the transcendence of suffering.”
mya ngan las 'das pa|The state of “extinction,” said to be blissful and inviolable, where the afflictions are extinguished and one is not subject to ever be born again.
mya ngan las 'das pa|Final liberation from suffering. In the Hinayāna it is believed attainable by turning away from the world of living beings and transcending all afflictions and selfishnesses through meditative trances. In the Mahāyāna, it is believed attainable only by the attainment of buddhahood, the nondual realization of the indivisibility of life and liberation, and the all-powerful compassion that establishes all living beings simultaneously in their own liberations.
mya ngan las 'das pa|Literally “extinction,” the state beyond sorrow, it refers to the ultimate attainment of buddhahood, the permanent cessation of all suffering and of the afflicted mental states that lead to suffering. Three types of nirvāṇa are identified: (1) the residual nirvāṇa where the person is still dependent on conditioned psycho-physical aggregates, (2) the non-residual nirvāṇa where the aggregates have also been consumed within emptiness, and (3) the non-abiding nirvāṇa transcending the extremes of phenomenal existence and quiescence. See also “parinirvāṇa.”

nyan thos|This term, based on the verb “to hear,” means disciple, and it originally referred to those direct disciples of the Buddha Śākyamuni who had actually heard the Buddha’s teachings. It is also used to refer to those who aspired to the state of an arhat, in contrast to the bodhisattvas. More generally, it refers to those who were followers of the non-Mahāyāna traditions of Buddhism.
nyan thos|The term is most simply interpreted as “those who hear” the Buddha’s teaching, i.e., his disciples, but the additional element that they then “make it heard” to others is often present in canonical glosses. In a Mahāyāna context it refers to those disciples of the Buddha who aspire to attain the state of a worthy one (arhat), and not to embarking on the path of a bodhisattva (with buddhahood as its ultimate goal).
nyan thos|Hīnayāna practitioner of the first turning of the wheel of the Dharma on the four noble truths, who realizes the suffering inherent in saṃsāra and focuses on understanding that there is no independent self. By conquering disturbing emotions, he liberates himself, attaining first the stage of stream enterer at the path of seeing, followed by the stage of once-returner who will be reborn only one more time, and then the stage of non-returner who will no longer be reborn into saṃsāra. The final goal is to become an arhat. These four stages are also known as the “four results of spiritual practice.”

nye bar len pa'i phung po lnga|The five aggregates (skandha) of form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness. On the individual level the five aggregates refer to the basis upon which the mistaken idea of a self is projected.

nye bar len pa'i phung po|Said of the aggregates individually, but more commonly in terms of all five as a collective, because they are “the basis of clinging to existence” (Edgerton).
nye bar len pa'i phung po|The “skandhas of appropriation” or “appropriated skandhas,” this refers to the five skandhas as the bases upon which a nonexistent self is mistakenly projected.

nye bar len pa|The ninth of the twelve links of dependent origination, “grasping” more broadly refers to the exceptionally strong form of craving through which we remain attached to and fixated on cyclic existence.
nye bar len pa|In some texts, four types of appropriation are listed: of desire (rāga), of view (dṛṣṭi), of rules and observances as paramount (śīla vrata parāmarśa), and of belief in a self (ātmavāda). The term {nye bar len pa} also means “grasping” and it was rendered as such when it refers to the ninth of the twelve links of dependent origination, between craving and becoming.
nye bar len pa|Also means “grasping” or “clinging;” but has a particular meaning as the ninth of the twelve links of dependent arising, between craving (tṛṣṇā, {sred pa}) and becoming or existence (bhava, {srid pa}). In some texts, four types of appropriation are listed: of desire (rāga), of view (dṛṣṭi), of rules and observances as paramount (śīla vrata parāmarśa), and of belief in a self (ātmavāda). Only the first three are mentioned in this sūtra.
nye bar len pa|The term upādāna figures in at least two prominent contexts within basic Buddhist classifications. Firstly, the five aggregates are also called “aggregates of clinging” when they refer to a nonliberated person. According to the Nibandhana commentary on Distinctly Ascertaining the Meanings, they are called “aggregates of clinging” for different reasons: they are “born from the clingings” because the aggregates arise due to the three mental afflictions of attraction, aversion, and confusion, which can also be called “clingings”; or, they are so called because the aggregates are under the control of the “clingings,” in the sense that it is due to the three mental afflictions that the aggregates remerge, after death, in a new realm of existence (Samtani 1971, pp. 87–88; the explanation in the Nibandhana partly follows Abhidharma kośa bhāṣya https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4090.html on kārikā 1.8; see Pradhan 1967, p. 5).\nAnother important context of the term upādāna is as the ninth of the “twelve parts of dependent arising.” Here upādāna arises with craving (tṛṣṇā) as its condition. The difference between “craving” and “clinging” is explained by Vasubandhu as follows: it is “craving” when one strongly wants enjoyments but has not yet started searching for those objects of enjoyments (yāvan na tadviṣaya paryeṣṭim āpadyate); it is “clinging” once one starts seeking ways to obtain those objects of enjoyments and thus runs in all directions (viṣaya prāptaye paryeṣṭim āpannaḥ sarvato dhāvati). See Pradhan 1967, p. 132.

nyon mongs|A term meaning “defilement” or “affliction” that refers to a wide range of mental factors that disturb the mind and lead to unwholesome deeds by body, speech, and mind. The Pāli kilesa, Middle-Indic kileśa, and Sanskrit kleśa all primarily mean “to soil, stain, defile.” The meaning “affliction” is a secondary development that derives from the more general (non-Buddhist) classical understanding of kliś (“to harm, to afflict”). Both meanings are noted by Buddhist commentators. The basic three defilements are attachment, aversion, and confusion.

These mental disturbances can be subsumed into the three or five poisons of attachment, anger, and ignorance plus arrogance and jealousy. Also translated here as “disturbing emotions.”
nyon mongs|In Buddhism, kleśa refers to any disturbing and destructive mental state that causes suffering and continued existence in saṃsāra. In this regard, the three basic kleśas are delusion, attachment, and aversion (or hatred). In terms of etymology, the primary meaning is “defilement.” This is reflected in the Middle Indic kileśa and Pali kilesa, which mean “to soil, stain, defile.” The meaning “affliction” is a secondary meaning that derives from a more general (non-Buddhist) classical understanding based on the verbal root kliś (“afflict, torment, cause pain”). Both senses are noted by later Buddhist commentators.

phung po|Lit. a “heap” or “pile.” The five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, volitional factors, and consciousness. On the individual level the five aggregates refer to the basis upon which the mistaken idea of a self is projected.\nHowever, in this text, five pure or uncontaminated aggregates are also listed, namely: the aggregate of morality, the aggregate of meditative stabilization, the aggregate of wisdom, the aggregate of liberation, and the aggregate of knowledge and seeing of liberation.
phung po|This translation of skandha is fairly well established, although some prefer the monosyllabic “group.” It is important to bear in mind that the original skandha has the sense of “pile,” or “heap,” which has the connotation of utter lack of internal structure, of a randomly collocated pile of things; thus “group” may convey a false connotation of structure and ordered arrangement. The five “compulsive” (upādāna) aggregates are of great importance as a schema for introspective meditation in the Abhidharma, wherein each is defined with the greatest subtlety and precision. In fact, the five terms rūpa, vedanā, samjñā, saṃskāra, and vijñāna have such a particular technical sense that many translators have preferred to leave them untranslated. Nevertheless, in the sūtra context, where the five are meant rather more simply to represent the relative living being (in the realm of desire), it seems preferable to give a translation—in spite of the drawbacks of each possible term—in order to convey the same sense of a total categorization of the psychophysical complex. Thus, for rūpa, “matter” is preferred to “form” because it more concretely connotes the physical and gross; for vedanā, “sensation” is adopted, as limited to the aesthetic; for samjñā, “intellect” is useful in conveying the sense of verbal, conceptual intelligence. For samskāra, which covers a number of mental functions as well as inanimate forces, “motivation” gives a general idea. And “consciousness” is so well established for vijñāna (although what we normally think of as consciousness is more like samjñā, i.e., conceptual and notional, and vijñāna is rather the “pure awareness” prior to concepts) as to be left unchallenged.

rang bzhin du gnas pa|An adjective applied to a monk who observes his vows and hence is “in good standing” or to a person who is sound of mind.
rang bzhin du gnas pa|Schmithausen understands this term as meaning “normal”: “should we [indeed] say that even the normal ({rang bzhin du gnas pa}, *prakṛtisthita?) images . . .” (Schmithausen 2014, p. 392, n. 1733). I understand the use of {rang bzhin du gnas pa} as implying a context where the object of the cognition is not an object of concentration corresponding to visualization practices as in the case of the kasiṇa. In the Pāli tradition, kasiṇa designates a visualization object used as a support for the totality of the meditator’s attention. In this paragraph, {sems can} has the connotation of beings who do not practice the yoga taught in this chapter, that is, ordinary beings.

rang bzhin yang dag par 'phags pa'i rgyal po|One of the tathāgatas attending the delivery of the MMK.
rang bzhin|The inherent nature of a phenomenon; in the present text, this is possibly a reference to the buddha-nature, or tathāgatagarbha.
rang bzhin|“According to Sāṁkhya, the prime substance, from which the material universe evolves, as opposed to puruṣa, pure consciousness.” (Reat, 39 n5).
rang bzhin|This term denotes the ontological status of phenomena, according to which they are said to possess existence in their own right—inherently, in and of themselves, objectively, and independent of any other phenomena such as our conception and labelling. The absence of such an ontological reality is defined as the true nature of reality, emptiness. Also rendered here as “basic nature.”
rang bzhin|Svabhāva is usually rendered as “self-nature,” sometimes as “own-being,” both of which have a certain literal validity. However, neither artificial term has any evocative power for the reader who has no familiarity with the original, and a term must be found that the reader can immediately relate to his own world to fulfill the function the original word had in its world. In our world of identities (national, racial, religious, personal, sexual, etc.), “identity” is a part of our makeup; thus, when we are taught the ultimate absence of identity of all persons and things, it is easy to “identify” what is supposedly absent and hence to try to understand what that entails.

rang rgyal gyi theg pa|The vehicle comprising the teaching of the pratyekabuddhas, literally “solitary enlightened ones” or “buddhas on their own.” The pratyekabuddhas are typically defined as those who have attained liberation but do not teach the path to liberation to others.

rang rgyal|“Solitary buddha.” Someone who has attained liberation entirely through their own contemplation, hence their alternate epithet, pratyayajina, which means one who has become a jina, or buddha, through dependence [on external factors that were contemplated upon]. This is the result of progress in previous lives but, unlike a buddha, they do not have the necessary accumulated merit nor the motivation to teach others.
rang rig|The nonconceptual wakefulness that is both the basis for and the result of tantric sādhana practice.
rang sangs rgyas kyi sa|Name of the eighth level attainable by bodhisattvas. See https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-1282 .

ras bal|karpāsa (rendered here “shrub cotton”) and Tūla (rendered here as “tree cotton”) are both kinds of cotton, perhaps overlapping as is translated into Tibetan as {ras bal} in some texts. Our rendering is based on the Tibetans’ choice of the term {shing bal} and the existence of a number of species of Gossypium, among which are the diploid, Asian G. arboreum and G. herbaceum (cf Monier Williams); Negi’s Tibetan-Sanskrit dictionary also mentions five kinds of tūla, at least some of which are trees. Other possible distinctions might be between annual and perennial plants, or varieties grown in different regions.\nSee https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-274 .

It is also worth noticing that the root spṛś is used far more often in Sanskrit than either “to touch” or “to come in contact with” is used in English, and can often mean something like “to obtain” etc.

rig pa dang ldan pa|A bodhisattva; a former incarnation of the Buddha while he was a practicing bodhisattva.
rig pa dang zhabs su ldan pa|A common description of buddhas. According to some explanations, “wisdom” refers to awakening, and “conduct” to the three trainings ({bslab pa gsum}) by means of which a buddha attains that awakening; according to others, “wisdom” refers to right view, and “conduct” to the other seven elements of the eightfold path.
rig pa dang zhabs su ldan pa|The Nibandhana explains this as a metaphor of the eye and the feet, which, operating together, allow one to move; knowledge, interpreted as either “right view” or as “the training in wisdom,” is like the eye, while the other seven parts of the noble eightfold path, or the two other trainings in discipline and samādhi, function as the “feet.” This explanation is also found in the sgra sbyor bam po gnyis pa commentary on the Mahāvyutpatti, which further clarifies that {zhabs} is here simply the honorific term for “foot” ({carana ni rkang pa}). Thus, although it is not uncommon to translate caraṇa here with “conduct,” this loses the significance of the metaphor.

These comprise the knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings, the knowledge of past lives, and the knowledge of the cessation of defilements. These are the last three of the six superknowledges or of the ten powers of the tathāgatas.
rig pa gsum|As indicated in the https://read.84000.co/translation/toh238.html (Toh. 238, mdo sde, dza, 42a), these comprise the awareness of clairvoyance ({lha'i mig gi rig pa}), the awareness that recollects past abodes ({sngon gyi gnas rjes su dran pa'i rig pa}), and the awareness of the cessation of contaminants ({zag pa zad pa'i rig pa}). See Nordrang Orgyan (2008): 428.
rig pa gsum|The three kinds of supernormal cognition among the six supernormal powers (六神通). Applied to buddhas they are called 三達, and applied to worthy ones they are called 三明.

In the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya (倶舍論) 27, the three are termed 住智識證明, 死生識證明, and 漏盡識證明 (Skt. tri-vidya, tisrovidyāḥ, traividya; Pāli ti-vijjā; Tib. {rig pa gsum}).

rigs kyi bu|A term of endearment, used by a teacher when addressing a male follower of the bodhisattva path.
rigs kyi bu|Indian term of address used toward a male student of the bodhisattva path. While this is usually a characteristic pertaining to Brahmins (i.e., born in the Brahmin caste to seven-generation Brahmin parents), the Buddha redefined noble birth as determined by an individual’s ethical conduct and integrity. Thus, someone who enters the Buddha’s Saṅgha is called a “son or daughter of noble family” and is in this sense “good” or “noble” and considered born again (dvija, or “twice born”).
rigs kyi sa|First level of realization on the path of the hearers.
rigs kyi sa|Lit. “Lineage level.” The second of the ten levels traversed by all practitioners, from the level of an ordinary person until reaching buddhahood. See “ten levels.”

rigs|Generally a reference to a person’s spiritual disposition.
rigs|The four social classes of traditional Hindu society: brahmin, kṣatriya, vaiśya, and śūdra.
rigs|Apart from its ordinary meaning as “family,” the term often refers to a tathāgata family (alternatively called a buddha family), reflecting the division of the Buddhist pantheon into families. In the Kriyātantras there are four main tathāgata families: the tathāgata, lotus, jewel, and vajra families.
rigs|In the context‌ of the present text, this term denotes the heritage or family of bodhisattvas following the Great Vehicle.\nWhen refering a son or daughter enlightened heritage, the expressions kula putra ({rigs kyi bu}) and kula duhitā ({rigs kyi bu mo}) are terms of endearment with which a teacher may address his or her own students. See the definition in Zhang Yisun et al (1975): 2686. In the context‌ of the present sūtra, these terms therefore denote a male or female follower of the Great Vehicle, distinct from the adherents of the lesser vehicles. This may be suggested in the translation “children of enlightened heritage,” which other interpretative renderings, such as “son of a noble family” or “son of a good family,” would lack.

See also the detailed description in https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-068-021.html#UT22084-068-021-145 .
rin po che sna bdun|The seven royal substances or treasures of a universal emperor: precious wheel ({'khor lo rin po che}), precious jewel ({nor bu rin po che}), precious queen ({btsun mo rin po che}), precious minister ({blon po rin po che}), precious elephant ({glang po rin po che}), precious excellent horse ({rta mchog rin po che}), and precious army officer ({dmag dpon rin po che}).
rin po che sna bdun|When associated with the seven heavenly bodies, and therefore the seven days of the week, they are ruby for the sun, moonstone or pearl for the moon, coral for Mars, emerald for Mercury, yellow sapphire for Jupiter, diamond for Venus, and blue sapphire for Saturn. There are variant lists not associated with the heavenly bodies but retaining the number seven, which include gold, silver, and so on. In association with a cakravartin the seven jewels can refer, according to the Abhidharma, to his magical wheel, elephant, horse, wish-fulfilling jewel, queen, minister, and leading householder. In the Tibetan maṇḍala offering practice, the householder is replaced by a general.
rin po che sna bdun|The seven possessions of a cakravartin including the precious wheel, the precious elephant, the precious horse, the precious jewel, the precious woman, the precious steward, and the precious minister. In some forms of the list the steward or minister is variably replaced by the precious general (senāpatiratna; {dmag dpon rin po che}) or the precious sword (khaḍgaratna; {ral gri rin po che}). A more detailed description of these seven can be found in Toh 95, The Play in Full, https://read.84000.co/translation/toh95.html#UT22084-046-001-92–https://read.84000.co/translation/toh95.html#UT22084-046-001-103. There is also a detailed description of the seven treasures and the corresponding causal conditions for obtaining them in Toh 4087, the Kāraṇaprajñapti, folio 111.bhttps://read.84000.co/translation/toh4087.html. The term should not be confused with seven precious substances, a set of seven precious stones or minerals, which is a term found elsewhere but also rendered {rin po che sna bdun}.
rin po che sna bdun|The usual list is: (1) the precious golden wheel (Skt. cakraratna; Tib. {'khor lo rin po che}); (2) the precious jewel (Skt. maṇiratna; Tib. {nor bu rin po che}); (3) the precious queen (Skt. strīratna; Tib. {btsun mo rin po che}); (4) the precious minister (Skt. puruṣaratna or pariṇāyakaratna; Tib. {blon po rin po che}); (5) the precious elephant (Skt. hastiratna; Tib. {glang po rin po che}); (6) the precious horse (Skt. aśvaratna; Tib. {rta mchog rin po che}); and (7) the precious general (Skt. khaḍgaratna or senāpatiratna; Tib. {dmag dpon rin po che}). Here the precious queen is substituted by a precious woman (Tib. {bud med rin po che}) and the precious general is substituted by a precious householder (Tib. {khyim bdag rin po che}). However, in this text they appear listed slightly differently (see https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-076-001.html#UT22084-076-001-269 ). Here the precious queen is substituted by a precious woman (Tib. {bud med rin po che}), and the precious general is substituted by a precious householder (Tib. {khyim bdag rin po che}).

ring du 'khyam pa|Literally “those who have gone to the afterlife.” A synonym or interlinear gloss for preta; ghost in Exposition of Karma. Pretas are a class of sentient beings belonging to the “bad” or “unfortunate rebirth destinies” (Skt. apāya); see “animal.” In the commentary to the Petavatthu (the seventh book of the Khuddakanikāya of the Pāli Canon), the former term is explained as “having gone to the beyond or the afterlife” (Pāli paralokagata), which is effectively the same as Sanskrit preta and Pāli peta; departed, dead. The meaning of durāgata or dūraṃgama (“far-going,” “going here and there”) may refer to the belief that the ghosts of the deceased are able to move freely and quickly through space because they do not have physical bodies, and that the realm of the ghosts does not, in fact, exist in a fixed location but is everywhere. As the stories of the Petavatthu illustrate, the worlds of ghosts and humans often intertwine.

Therein, the five false imaginations which may confront reversible bodhisattvas are (1) wondering whether they are engaged in the emptiness of the transcendent perfection of wisdom and the transcendent perfection of wisdom ({ci shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa'i stong pa nyid/ shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa la spyod dam}), (2) wondering whether they are exclusively engaged in something other than the transcendent perfection of wisdom ({ci shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa las 'ba' zhig spyod dam}), (3) wondering whether they are engaged in the transcendent perfection of wisdom ({'on te shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa la spyod dam}), (4) wondering whether they are engaged in emptiness ({'on te stong pa nyid spyod dam}), or (5) wondering whether they are engaged in something other than emptiness ({'on te stong pa nyid las gzhan pa zhig spyod dam}).
rnam par rtog pa'i mtshan ma|A “conceptual sign” should here be understood to refer to those signs that arise through conceptual engagement with the phenomenon under examination or discussion. See also “sign.”
rnam par rtog pa|Any type of dualistic concept or idea.
rnam par rtog pa|According to Buddhist epistemology, to conceptualize is to cognize in such a way that language is involved as a medium.
rnam par rtog pa|A mental function that tends to superimpose upon reality, either relative or ultimate, a conceptualized dualistic perspective fabricated by the subjective mind. It is often opposed to direct perception ({pratyakṣa}, {mngon sum}).
rnam par rtog pa|This brings up another important group of words that has never been treated systematically in translation: vikalpa, parikalpa, samāropa, adhyāropa, kalpanā, samjñā, and prapāñca. All of these refer to mental functions that tend to superimpose upon reality, either relative or ultimate, a conceptualized reality fabricated by the subjective mind. Some translators have tended to lump these together under the rubric “discursive thought,” which leads to the misleading notion that all thought is bad, something to be eliminated, and that sheer “thoughtlessness” is “enlightenment,” or whatever higher state is desired. According to Buddhist scholars, thought in itself is simply a function, and only thought that is attached to its own content over and above the relative object, i.e., “egoistic” thought, is bad and to be eliminated. Therefore we have chosen a set of words for the seven Skt. terms: respectively, “conceptualization,” “imagination,” “presumption,” “exaggeration,” “construction,” “conception” or “notion,” and “fabrication.” This does not mean that these words are not somewhat interchangeable or that another English word might not be better in certain contexts; it only represents an attempt to achieve consistency with the original usages.

rnam par shes pa la gnas pa bdun|This refers to the seven categories of living beings, as enumerated in the Abhi dharma kośa, III, v. 5-6a. The seven abodes of consciousness consist of beings who differ physically and intellectually; beings who differ physically but are similar intellectually; beings similar physically but who differ intellectually; beings similar physically and intellectually; and three types of immaterial beings (nānātvakāya saṃjñāś ca nānākāyaika saṃjñinaḥ / viparyayāc caikakāya saṃjñāś cārūpiṇas trayaḥ // vijñāna sthitayaḥ sapta…). According to Vasubandhu the first category consists of men, the six types of gods of the desire-realm, and the gods of the first realm of contemplation (brahma vihāra) except those fallen from higher realms (prathamābhinivṛta); the second category consists of those fallen (prathamābhiniṛvṛta) gods who have different bodies but whose intellects are single-mindedly aware of the idea of being created by Brahmā; the third category consists of the gods of the second realm of contemplation—the abhāsvara (clear-light) gods, the parīṭṭābha (radiant) gods, and the apramāṇābha (immeasurably luminous) gods—who have similar luminous bodies but differ in their thoughts, which are bent on the experiences of pleasure and numbness; the fourth category consists of the śubhakṛtsna (pure-wholeness) gods, whose intellects are united in concentration on bliss; the fifth category consists of the immaterial beings who reside in the realm of infinite space; the sixth category consists of the immaterial beings who reside in the realm of infinite consciousness; and the seventh category consists of the immaterial beings who reside in the realm of nothingness. (See also Mvy, Nos. 2289-2295.)

rnam par shes pa'i gnas bdun|Seven categories that describe living beings in the higher realms, from humans up to the formless realm: (1) those different in body and different in perception; (2) those different in body and equal in perception; (3) those equal in body but different in perception; (4) those equal in body and equal in perception; (5) those reborn in the sphere of boundless space; (6) those reborn in the sphere of boundless consciousness; and (7) those reborn in the sphere of nothingness.
rnam par shes pa'i khams|The consciousness as an element or constituent of a sentient being.

rnam par shes pa'i zas|Fourth of the four nourishments.
rnam par shes pa|One of the five aggregates, and third of the twelve links of dependent origination, this is sometimes also called “cognition,” and is the self-reflexive awareness of beings.
rnam par shes pa|Consciousness is generally classified into the five sensory consciousnesses and mental consciousness. Fifth of the five aggregates and third of the twelve links of dependent origination.
rnam par shes pa|The third link of dependent origination, the fifth of the five aggregates. In most Abhidharma accounts it comprises the six sensory consciousnesses (eye, ear, nose, taste, body, and mind), but in Yogācāra theory two more kinds of consciousness, afflicted (kliṣṭamanas) and storehouse (ālayavijñāna), are added. For the sixth consciousness, see also “mind consciousness.”
rnam par shes pa|The fifth of the five aggregates; also counted as the sixth of the six elements. In most Abhidharma accounts it comprises the six sensory consciousnesses, but in Yogācāra theory two more kinds of consciousness, afflicted (kliṣṭamanas) and storehouse (ālayavijñāna), are added. The term “consciousness” in this sūtra should not be assumed to conform fully to these classic categorizations.
rnam par shes pa|Third of the twelve links of dependent origination. Consciousness is defined as “an awareness which is knowing and luminous.” Not being physical, it lacks resistance to obstruction. It has neither shape nor color, and it can be experienced but not externally perceived as an object. A distinction is made between the mundane consciousness of sentient beings, and the gnosis of the buddhas. In the context‌ of the present discourse, the former includes six aspects of consciousness, namely, visual consciousness, auditory consciousness, olfactory consciousness, tactile consciousness, and mental consciousness, the last of which objectively refers to mental phenomena.
rnam par shes pa|The term vijñāna is formed by the prefix vi plus a formation from the root jñā, which means “to know,” “to understand,” “to know of,” “to be aware of.” (This is reproduced in the Tibetan as {rnam par} + {shes pa}.) “Consciousness” has a specific meaning in Buddhist texts and refers to awareness of an object, point of reference, or support. This meaning is occasionally obtained by understanding the vi as standing for viṣaya, which means a domain of activity and, in this case, the object of perception. The standard list of consciousness types is six, corresponding to the five sense faculties plus the “thought consciousness.” This refers to a type of mental perception that arises taking as its basis not a sense faculty but a prior moment of consciousness itself; this type of consciousness is unrestricted as per its possible range of objects, both in terms of their location in time (past, present, or future) and in terms of their type (visual, audible, etc., including entities that are not within the range of any of the five senses).

rnam par thar ba|This can include any method for liberation. There are numerous liberations described in this sūtra, each kalyāṇamitra having a specific liberation.
rnam par thar ba|This can include any method for liberation. The most commonly listed are the eight liberations: (1) form viewing form: the view of dependent origination and emptiness; (2) the formless viewing form: having seen internal emptiness, seeing the emptiness of external forms; (3) the view of the pleasant: seeing pleasant appearances as empty and contemplating the unpleasant; (4) seeing the emptiness of the formless meditation of infinite space; (5) seeing the emptiness of the formless meditation of infinite consciousness; (6) seeing the emptiness of the formless meditation of nothingness; (7) seeing the emptiness of the formless meditation of neither perception nor nonperception; and (8) seeing the emptiness of the state of cessation.
rnam par thar pa brgyad|The liberation of form observing form, the liberation of the formless observing form, the liberation of observing beauty, the liberation of infinite space, the liberation of infinite consciousness, the liberation of nothing whatsoever, the liberation of neither presence nor absence of perception, and the liberation of cessation.
rnam par thar pa brgyad|The first three liberations occur within the form realm: (1) liberation of the embodied looking at form ({gzugs can gzugs la blta ba'i rnam thar}), (2) liberation of the formless looking at a form ({gzugs med gzugs la blta ba'i rnam thar}), and (3) liberation through beautiful form ({sdug pa'i rnam par thar pa}); and the latter five occur within the formless realm: (4) liberation of infinite space ({nam mkha' mtha' yas kyi rnam thar}), (5) liberation of infinite consciousness ({rnam shes mtha' yas kyi rnam thar}), (6) liberation of nothingness ({ci yang med pa'i rnam thar}), (7) liberation of the peak of existence ({srid rtsi'i rnam thar}), and (8) liberation of cessation ({'gog pa'i rnam thar}).
rnam par thar pa brgyad|Included among the fifty-five types of virtuous phenomena, the first three occur within the form realm ({gzugs kyi rnam par thar pa gsum}): (1) the liberation of the embodied looking at a form ({gzugs can gzugs la blta ba'i rnam thar}), (2) liberation of the formless looking at a form ({gzugs med gzugs la blta ba'i rnam thar}), (3) liberation through beautiful form ({sdug pa'i rnam par thar pa}), and the latter five occur within the formless realm: (4) liberation of infinite space ({nam mkha' mtha' yas kyi rnam thar}), (5) liberation of infinite consciousness ({rnam shes mtha' yas kyi rnam thar}), (6) liberation of nothingness ({ci yang med pa'i rnam thar}), (7) liberation of the peak of existence ({srid rtsi'i rnam thar}), and (8) liberation of cessation ({'gog pa'i rnam thar}) (Rigzin 236, 239).
rnam par thar pa brgyad|The eight aspects of liberation ensue: (1) when corporeal beings observe physical forms [in order to compose the mind]; (2) when formless beings endowed with internal perception observe external physical forms; (3) when beings are inclined toward pleasant states; (4) when one achieves and abides in the sense field of infinite space, thinking, ‘Space is infinite.’ (5) The fifth ensues when one achieves and abides in the sense field of infinite consciousness, thinking, ‘Consciousness is infinite.’ (6) The sixth is when one achieves and abides in the sense field of nothing-at-all, thinking, ‘There is nothing at all.’ (7) The seventh is when one achieves and abides in the sense field of neither perception nor non-perception. (8) The eighth is when one achieves and abides in the cessation of all perceptions and feelings.\nFor a more complete description, see https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-176 .
rnam par thar pa brgyad|A series of progressively more subtle states of meditative realization or attainment. There are several presentations of these found in the canonical literature. One of the most common is as follows: (1) One observes form while the mind dwells at the level of the form realm. (2) One observes form externally while discerning formlessness internally. (3) One dwells in the direct experience of the body’s pleasant aspect. (4) One dwells in the realization of the sphere of infinite space by transcending all conceptions of matter, resistance, and diversity. (5) Transcending the sphere of infinite space, one dwells in the realization of the sphere of infinite consciousness. (6) Transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness, one dwells in the realization of the sphere of nothing whatsoever. (7) Transcending the sphere of nothing whatsoever, one dwells in the realization of the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception. (8) Transcending the sphere of neither perception and nonperception, one dwells in the realization of the cessation of conception and feeling.
rnam par thar pa brgyad|The first consists of the seeing of form by one who has form; the second consists of the seeing of external form by one with the concept of internal formlessness; the third consists of the physical realization of pleasant liberation and its successful consolidation; the fourth consists of the full entrance to the infinity of space through transcending all conceptions of matter, and the subsequent decline of conceptions of resistance and discredit of conceptions of diversity; the fifth consists of full entrance into the infinity of consciousness, having transcended the infinity of space; the sixth consists of the full entrance into the sphere of nothingness, having transcended the sphere of the infinity of conscious ness; the seventh consists of the full entrance into the sphere of neither conscious ness nor un conscious ness, having transcended the sphere of nothingness; the eighth consists of the perfect cessation of suffering, having transcended the sphere of neither conscious ness nor un conscious ness. Thus the first three liberations form specific links to the ordinary perceptual world; the fourth to seventh are equivalent to the four absorptions; and the eighth represents the highest attainment.

rten cing 'brel par 'byung ba|A key term for Buddhist philosophy that represents the basic Buddhist understanding of causal processes.\nIn pratītya-samutpāda, a compound of two terms, samutpāda means “arisin” or “coming into existence” and poses little interpretive difficulty. The preverb sam- is sometimes understood as meaning “together” (samavāyena), referring to the doctrine that no entity whatsoever arises on its own—ultimately existent bits of materiality always arise with other bits, and moments of mind are always accompanied by mental states. The sgra sbyor bam po gnyis pa commentary on the Mahāvyutpatti, however, clarifies that the Tibetan translation has {'brel par} in the sense of “connection,” a rendering of sambandha resulting from an interpretation of the sam- as indicating connection ({sam ni sambandha stes 'brel pa la bya}).\nThe first part of the compound, pratītya, can be explained in two very different ways, which have occasioned lengthy debates at the crossroads of philosophy and grammar. According to one explanation, it would mean “things that are each bound to go, to vanish,” hence the whole expression would mean something like “the arising of things that are each bound to vanish,” i.e., the arising of impermanent things. This explanation is favored, for example, by Bhāviveka, and Candrakīrti criticizes him for it (see Macdonald 2015, pp. 121–32). It is also the one opted for by Vīryaśrīdatta in the Nibandhana commentary on Distinctly Ascertaining the Meanings (see Samtani 1971, p. 98).\nThe other interpretation takes pratītya as meaning “having obtained” or “having depended upon,” more flexibly also “depending,” i.e., without necessarily implying temporal succession of two activities by the same entity, which is problematic, as the entity cannot be easily expected to do something (even “depending”) before it has come into existence (unless one is a Vaibhāṣika who accepts existence of future entities). In this interpretation, the sense of the whole expression is expanded as “arising in dependence upon an assemblage of causes and conditions.” This interpretation seems to be prevalent, and hence it has been followed in the translation (it is also the basis for the Tibetan rendering as {rten cing 'brel par 'byung ba}). It has the distinct advantage of matching the only possible sense of pratītya when it appears outside of a compound in sūtra passages where the dependent arising of, say, eye consciousness is described. A long discussion of the proper sense and the two interpretations of the term pratītya samutpāda can be found in chapter 3 of the Abhidharma kośa bhāṣya https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4090.html (Pradhan 1967, p. 138).\nWe find numerous different explanations of dependent arising in the Buddhist texts, but three of them are most prominent: a short general definition of contingent coming into existence, as “A being there, B exists; from the arising of A, B arises”; the example of the arising of a single momentary entity, as “depending upon visible form and the eye faculty, eye consciousness arises”; and lastly the process of causality known as “dependent arising with twelve parts,” which describes the birth, complete life cycle, death, and rebirth of a sentient being in the desire realm (the part of the universe where we live and where several classes of sentient beings are born from a womb).\nThe twelve parts of dependent arising are often distributed into three lifetimes: ignorance and assembled factors belong to the previous lifetime; consciousness, name-and-form, the six entrances, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, and existence belong to the present lifetime; and birth and decay-and-death belong to the future lifetime (see Abhidharma kośa bhāṣya 3.25https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4090.html, Pradhan 1967, pp. 133–34). This explanation allows one to make good sense of the frequent sequence, found in the sūtras, where first dependent arising is explained, and then it is said to vanquish all views regarding past, present, or future lives (this progression is also found in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā;https://read.84000.co/translation/toh3824.html see Salvini 2011).

sa bcu|In this text, two sets of ten levels are mentioned. One set refers to the standard list of ten levels most commonly found in the general Mahāyāna literature; for a detailed explanation of this set, see ten bodhisattva levels. The other set, common to Prajñāpāramitā literature, charts the progress of an individual practitioner who, starting from the level of an ordinary person, sequentially follows the path of a śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and then a bodhisattva on their way to complete buddhahood.\nThe first three levels pertain to an ordinary person preparing themselves for the path; the next four (4-7) chart the path of a śrāvaka; level eight aligns with the practices of a pratyekabuddha; level nine refers to the path of bodhisattvas; and finally, level ten is the attainment of buddhahood. These ten levels comprise (1) the level of Śuklavipaśyanā, (2) the level of Gotra, (3) the level of Aṣṭamaka, (4) the level of Darśana, (5) the level of Tanū, (6) the level of Vītarāga, (7) the level of Kṛtāvin, (8) the Pratyekabuddha level, (9) the Bodhisattva level, and (10) the Buddha level of perfect awakening.
sa bcu|Different versions of these exist in the Buddhist doctrines of different periods. In the context of the bodhisattva path, a standard list is (1) Joyful (pramuditā), in which one rejoices at realizing a partial aspect of the truth; (2) Stainless (vimalā), in which one is free from all defilement; (3) Illuminator (prabhākarī), in which one radiates the light of wisdom; (4) Radiant Intellect (arciṣmatī), in which the radiant flame of wisdom burns away earthly desires; (5) Difficult to Master (sudurjayā), in which one surmounts the illusions of darkness, or ignorance, as the Middle Way; (6) Manifest (abhimukhī) in which supreme wisdom begins to manifest; (7) Far-Reaching (dūraṅgamā), in which one rises above the states of the lower vehicles of hearers and solitary buddhas; (8) Immovable (acalā), in which one dwells firmly in the truth of the Middle Way and cannot be perturbed by anything; (9) Good Intelligence (sādhumatī), in which one preaches the Dharma unimpededly; and (10) Cloud of Dharma (dharmameghā), in which one benefits all sentient beings with Dharma, just as a cloud releases rain impartially on all things.

sbyang|De Jong points out that “the word {sbyaṅ} is recorded in Sumatiratna’s Tibetan-Mongolian Dictionary, II, (Ulanbator, 1959), p. 357: rtsva daṅ ‘bru-la sogs-pa ’jog-pa’i gnas-te sgo daṅ skar-khuṅ med-pa/yaṅ baṅ-ba ’am rdzaṅ yaṅ źes-pa sbyaṅ “a place without doors and windows where herbs and grains are stored; also a store-room or a box” (De Jong 1975, p. 117). (We thank James Gentry for pointing out the sense of “granary.”)\nThe term {sbyang}, if it may indeed be understood as something akin to a “box,” could rather match the term mutoḍī (see Edgerton 1993, p. 436), reported by Samtani as the reading of ANe Comy (the manuscript of the Nibandhana commentary), and also appearing (as mūtoḍī) in the relevant Śikṣāsamuccaya parallel (see Samtani 1971, p. 24, n. 2), rather than the term koṣṭhāgāra in the printed edition. The term mutoḍī matches the Pāli putoỊī/mūtoỊī/mutoli found in Pāli passages parallel to this and explained as follows:\n“A putoḷi is a circular container made by tying together clothes and so forth in the shape of a sack” (vatthādīhi pasibbakākārena bandhitvā kataṃ āvāṭanaṃ putoḷi, ṭīkā on the Mahāsatipaṭṭhānasutta, Mahāvagga, Dīghanikāya; vatthādīhi pasibbakākārena bandhitvā kataṃ āvaṭanaṃ putoḷi, ṭīka on the Mahāsatipaṭṭānasutta, Mūlapaṇṇāsa, Majjhima nikāya; here we take it that āvāṭanam/āvaṭanam = āvaṭṭanam).

shes pa|The term jñāna is formed by the root jñā, meaning “to know,” “to know of,” “to understand,” “to be aware of,” with the addition of the pratyaya lyuṭ, which can be interpreted as having different values (the instrument of awareness, its agent, or the action of awareness). We have chosen “awareness” as it was the only that seemed to fit for two important (and not unrelated) contexts wherein jñāna is used: awareness of something, and nonobjective, nonconceptual awareness. In Tibetan the two senses are sometimes distinguished by using {shes pa} and {ye shes}, respectively, but the distinction in the usage of these two terms is not clearly marked in works that are translations from the Sanskrit, and hence it is less relevant for the Kangyur than it may be for indigenous Tibetan works. The nature of jñāna and its relationship with “wisdom” (prajñā) is the topic of one of the chapters of the Abhidharmakośa https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4089.html and is also thematized in a number of Mahāyāna sūtras and śāstras.

shes rab|As the sixth of the six perfections, it refers to the profound understanding of the emptiness of all phenomena, the realization of ultimate reality—also sometimes rendered as wisdom. In other contexts it refers to the mental factor responsible for ascertaining specific qualities of a given object, such as its characteristics or whether it should be taken up or rejected.
shes rab|[The female element of the coupling pair in sexual yoga. Here, the term “consort” has been used to render slighty different concepts or views of the female consort, most important of them are: mudrā, vidyā, and prajñā.\nMudrā emphasizes the symbolic form of the female consort, while vidyā and prajñā emphasize the wisdom, or insight, aspect that the female principle embodies, (also rendered here as “wisdom consort.”]
shes rab|The female element of the coupling pair in sexual yoga. In this translation the term “consort” has been used to render different terms with slighty different concepts of the female consort, the most important being mudrā, vidyā, and prajñā. Mudrā emphasizes the symbolic form of the female consort, while vidyā and prajñā emphasize the wisdom, or insight, aspect that the female principle embodies (see also “wisdom consort”).
shes rab|The term prajñā is formed by adding the prefix pra, usually understood as meaning “excellent,” to the root jñā, meaning “to know,” “to know of,” “to understand,” “to cognize,” “to be aware of,” etc. Prajñā is used in more mundane contexts as referring to something very akin to “wisdom,” while in a Buddhist context it is often defined as dharma-pravicaya, the classification or analysis of entities, predicated upon a recognition of their specific nature. It is thus also a synonym of abhidharma and of “insight” or “clear sight” (vipaśyanā).
shes rab|In this text {shes rab} seems to mean primarily knowledge (defined as insight and understanding one has gained through studying and experience), specifically knowledge of the teachings of the Buddha in general, and of karmic cause and effect in particular (Cf. Edgerton, BHSD, s.v. prajñā: “(Skt., and Pāli paññā), knowledge: three kinds, śrutamayī, cintāmayī, and bhāvanāmayī”, i.e., knowledge consisting in listening to the teachings, reflecting on them, and meditation (cultivating or internalizing the teachings). Also translated here as “knowledge of the Dharma.”\nSee also https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-072-039.html#UT22084-072-039-104 .
shes rab|In the context‌ of the transcendent perfections, wisdom is the sixth of the six transcendent perfections.\nThe translation of prajñā ({shes rab}) by “wisdom” here defers to the precedent established by Edward Conze in his writings. It has a certain poetic resonance which more accurate renderings—“discernment,” “discriminative awareness,” or “intelligence”—unfortunately lack. It should be remembered that in Abhidharma, prajñā is classed as one of the five object-determining mental states (pañca viṣaya niyata, {yul nges lnga}), alongside “will,” “resolve,” “mindfulness,” and “meditative stability.” Following A saṅga’s Abhi dharma sam uccaya, Jamgon Kongtrul (TOK, Book 6, Pt. 2, p. 498), defines prajñā as “the discriminative awareness that analyzes specific and general characteristics.” Therefore “wisdom” in this context is to be understood in the cognitive or analytical Germanic sense of witan or weis (Dayal 1932: 136) and not as an abstract “body of knowledge,” or in any aloof and mysterious theosophical sense. Nor indeed is there any association with the Greek sophia.\nAlso translated here as “discriminative awareness.”

Jyoti can mean both “light” and “star,” and in describing this jewel the Sanskrit more likely means “banner of light.” However, the Tibetan translates the term as “banner of stars.”

skye mched|Sometimes translated “sense field” or “base of cognition,” the term usually refers to the six sense faculties and their corresponding objects, i.e. the first twelve of the eighteen constituents (Skt. dhātus). Along with the aggregates (Skt. skandhas) and the constituents, one of the three major categories in the taxonomy of phenomena in the sūtra literature.
skye mched|The six bases of sensory perception are the six sensory faculties: the eyes, nose, ear, tongue, body, and mind, which form in the womb but as yet have no contact with the external six bases of sensory perception: form, smell, sound, taste, touch, and phenomena. In another context in this sūtra, āyatana refers to the four formless meditations (see “liberations”).
skye mched|Twelve bases of sensory perception: the six sensory faculties (the eyes, nose, ear, tongue, body, and mind), which form in the womb and eventually have contact with the external six bases of sensory perception (form, smell, sound, taste, touch, and phenomena). This can also refer to the four meditative states associated with the formless realm: (1) infinite space, (2) infinite consciousness, (3) nothingness, and (4) neither perception nor nonperception.
skye mched|The sense spheres are a collective list of the six sense objects (forms, sounds, odors, tastes, textures, mental phenomena) with their respective senses (eye, ear, nose, tongue, tactile sense, and mind) totaling twelve and indicating their interdependence. In this sūtra, they are equated to an “empty city.” This most likely denotes the fact that there is no self independent of the interaction of these or perceiver independent of the process of perception.
skye mched|The twelve sense-media are eye-medium (cakṣurāyatana), form-medium (rūpa-), ear-medium (śrotra-), sound-medium (śabda-), nose-medium (ghrāna-), scent-medium (gandha-), tongue-medium (jihvā-), taste-medium (rasa-), body-medium (kāya-), texture-medium (spraṣṭavya), mental-medium (mana-), and phenomena-medium (dharmāyatana). In some passages they are enumerated as six, the object-faculty pair being taken as one, and it is this set of six that is the fifth member of the twelve links of dependent origination. The word āyatana is usually translated as “base,” but the Skt., Tib., and Ch. all indicate “something through which the senses function” rather than a basis from which they function; hence “medium” is suggested.
skye mched|These can be listed as twelve or as six entrances (sometimes also called sense sources, sense fields, bases of cognition, or simply āyatanas):\nIn context of epistemology, it is one way of describing experience and the world in terms of twelve sense sources, which can be divided into inner and outer sense sources, namely: 1-2) eye and form, 3-4) ear and sound, 5-6) nose and odor, 7-8) tongue and taste, 9-10) body and touch, 11-12) mind and mental phenomena. (These are subsumed in the eighteen bases or elements, where to the twelve sense sources, the six consciousnesses are added.)\nIn the context of the twelve links of dependent origination, only six sense sources are mentioned and they are the inner sense sources (similar to the six faculties) of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
skye mchog|A demon leader.
skye med drug|Six sets of similar dharmas under which all compounded and uncompounded dharmas may be included: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, and their objects—visible forms, sounds, smells, flavors, tangibles, and dharmas.

It is important to note that this great compassion has nothing to do with any sentimental emotion such as that stimulated by such a reflection as “Oh, the poor creatures! How they are suffering!” On the contrary, great compassion is accompanied by the clear awareness that ultimately there are no such things as living beings, suffering, etc., in reality. Thus it is a sensitivity that does not entertain any dualistic notion of subject and object; indeed, such an unlimited sensitivity might best be termed “empathy.”

snyoms par 'jug pa|A technical term referring to a meditative state attained through the practice of concentration. (The word “attainment” is also used here to translate non-technical words that have the sense of “obtain” or “acquire.”)
snyoms par 'jug pa|One of several common terms that are used to describe meditative states. The four states of meditative attainment refer here to the states of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, and neither perception nor absence of perception.
snyoms par 'jug pa|One of the synonyms for the meditative state. The Tibetan translation interpreted it as sama-āpatti, which brings in the idea of “equal,” or “level,” whereas it may very well be like “samādhi,” sam-āpatti, with the similar meaning of concentration. Unlike samādhi, however, it also occurs with the meaning of “completion,” “attainment,” and “diligent practice.”
snyoms par 'jug pa|One of the synonyms for the meditative state, in tems of both the state itself and the various meditative states that serve as attainments along the path. The Tibetan translation interprets it as sama-āpatti, which brings in the idea of “equal,” or “level;” however, it can also be parsed as sam-āpatti, in which case it would have the sense of “concentration,” or “absorption,” much like “samādhi,” but with the added sense of “completion.”
snyoms par 'jug pa|A technical term referring to a meditative state attained through the practice of concentration. Usually a reference to the nine gradual attainments (navānupūrvavihārasamāpatti, {mthar gyis gnas pa'i snyoms par 'jug pa dgu}) that include the four attainments of the form realm, the four formless attainments, and the attainment of the state of cessation. (The word “attainment” is also used here to translate non-technical words that have the sense of “obtain” or “acquire.”)
snyoms par 'jug|“Absorption” has been translated as “meditation,” “contemplation,” “attainment,” etc., and any of these words might serve. The problem is to establish one English word for each of the important Sanskrit words samāpatti, dhyāna, samādhi, bhāvanā, etc., so as to preserve a consistency with the original. Therefore, I have adopted for these terms, respectively, “absorption,” “contemplation,” “concentration” and “realization” or “cultivation,” reserving the word “meditation” for general use with any of the terms when they are used not in a specific sense but to indicate mind-practice in general.
snyoms par gzhog pa|One of the synonyms for the meditative state. The Tibetan translation interpreted it as sama-āpatti, which brings in the idea of “equal,” or “level,” whereas it may very well be like “samādhi,” sam-āpatti, with the same meaning.

stong pa nyid stong pa nyid|One of the fourteen emptinesses and eighteen emptinesses
stong pa nyid|This could refer to any of a number of enumerations of emptinesses. “Seven emptinesses,” “fourteen emptinesses,” and “eighteen emptinesses” are listed in this sūtra.
stong pa nyid|In the Mahāyāna, this refers to the lack of any intrinsic nature in all phenomena that would allow them to be regarded as ultimately real, independently existing entities.
stong pa nyid|In the Mahāyāna this is the term for how phenomena are devoid of any nature of their own. One of the three doorways to liberation along with the absence of aspiration and the absence of attributes.
stong pa nyid|Voidness, emptiness; specifically, the emptiness of absolute substance, truth, identity, intrinsic reality, or self of all persons and things in the relative world, being quite opposed to any sort of absolute nothingness (see glossary, under “emptiness”).
stong pa nyid|Emptiness denotes the ultimate nature of reality, the total absence of inherent existence and self-identity with respect to all phenomena. According to this view, all things and events are devoid of any independent, intrinsic reality that constitutes their essence. Nothing can be said to exist independently from the complex network of factors that gives rise to their origination, nor are phenomena independent of the cognitive processes and mental constructs that make up the conventional framework within which their identity and existence are posited. When all levels of conceptualization dissolve and when all forms of dichotomizing tendencies are quelled through deliberate meditative deconstruction of conceptual elaborations, the ultimate nature of reality will finally become manifest. It is the first of the three gateways to liberation.
stong pa nyid|This Skt. term is usually translated by “voidness” because that English word is more rarely used in other contexts than “emptiness” and does not refer to any sort of ultimate nothingness, as a thing-in-itself, or even as the thing-in-itself to end all things-in-themselves. It is a pure negation of the ultimate existence of anything or, in Buddhist terminology, the “emptiness with respect to personal and phenomenal selves,” or “with respect to identity,” or “with respect to intrinsic nature,” or “with respect to essential substance,” or “with respect to self-existence established by intrinsic identity,” or “with respect to ultimate truth-status,” etc. Thus emptiness is a concept descriptive of the ultimate reality through its pure negation of whatever may be supposed to be ultimately real. It is an absence, hence not existent in itself. It is synonymous therefore with “infinity,” “absolute,” etc.—themselves all negative terms, i.e., formed etymologically from a positive concept by adding a negative prefix (in + finite = not finite; ab + solute = not compounded, etc.). But, since our verbally conditioned mental functions are habituated to the connection of word and thing, we tend to hypostatize a “void,” analogous to “outer space,” a “vacuum,” etc., which we either shrink from as a nihilistic nothingness or become attached to as a liberative nothingness; this great mistake can be cured only by realizing the meaning of the “emptiness of emptiness,” which brings us to the tolerance of inconceivability.

stong pa|Also rendered here as “empty.”
stong pa|A term used to express the absence of any intrinsic essence in all phenomena.

ta thA ga ta|A frequently used synonym for buddha. According to different explanations, it can be read as tathā-gata, literally meaning “one who has thus gone,” or as tathā-āgata, “one who has thus come.” Gata, though literally meaning “gone,” is a past passive participle used to describe a state or condition of existence. Tatha (tā), often rendered as “suchness” or “thusness,” is the quality or condition of things as they really are, which cannot be conveyed in conceptual, dualistic terms. Therefore, this epithet is interpreted in different ways, but in general it implies one who has gone in the same way that the buddhas of the past have gone, or one who has manifested the supreme awakening dependent on the reality that does not abide in the two extremes of existence and quiescence.

thabs|[The pair of the deity or practitioner in sexual yoga. See “consort (female)” and “consort (male).”]
thabs|Means and methods available to realized beings; represented by and refers to the male consort in sexual yoga.
thabs|The concept of skillful means is central to the understanding of the Buddha’s enlightened deeds and the many scriptures which are revealed contingent to the needs, interests, and mental dispositions of specific types of individuals. According to the Great Vehicle, training in skillful means collectively denotes the first five of the six transcendent perfections when integrated with wisdom, the sixth transcendent perfection, to form a union of discriminative awareness and means.
thabs|This is the expression in action of the great compassion of the Buddha and the bodhisattvas—physical, verbal, and mental. It follows that one empathetically aware of the troubles of living beings would, for his very survival, devise the most potent and efficacious techniques possible to remove those troubles, and the troubles of living beings are removed effectively only when they reach liberation. “Art” was chosen over the usual “method” and “means” because it has a stronger connotation of efficacy in our technological world; also, in Buddhism, liberative art is identified with the extreme of power, energy, and efficacy, as symbolized in the vajra (adamantine scepter): The importance of this term is highlighted in this sūtra by the fact that Vimalakīrti himself is introduced in the chapter entitled “Inconceivable Skill in Liberative Art”; this indicates that he, as a function of the nirmāṇakāya (incarnation-body), just like the Buddha himself, is the very incarnation of liberative art, and every act of his life is therefore a technique for the development and liberation of living beings. The “liberative” part of the translation follows “salvifique” in Lamotte’s phrase “moyens salvifique.”

thams cad mkhyen pa|An epithet of the buddhas. The homage to the Omniscient One at the beginning of a Buddhist scripture usually indicates that it belongs to the Vinaya Piṭaka.
thams cad mkhyen pa|This refers to the gnosis of the Buddha, with which there is nothing he does not know. However, not to confuse “omniscience” with the theistic conception of an omniscient god, the “everything” here is specifically everything about the source of the predicament of worldly life and the way of transcendence of that world through liberation. Since “everything” is only an abstract term without any particular referent, once we are clear about the implications of infinity, it does not refer to any sort of ultimate totality, since a totality can only be relative, i.e., a totality within a particular frame of reference. Thus, as Dharmakīrti has remarked, “it is not a question of the Buddha’s knowing the number of fish in the ocean,” i.e., since there are infinity of fish in infinity of oceans in infinity of worlds and universes. The Buddha’s omniscience, rather, knows how to develop and liberate any fish in any ocean, as well as all other living beings.

theg pa chen po|The same as the Bodhisattva Vehicle, whose practitioners aim at complete buddhahood.
theg pa chen po|Literally the Sanskrit means “great way,” but in Buddhism this has developed the meaning of great vehicle, and so is translated literally into Tibetan as “great carrier.”
theg pa chen po|One of the major three Buddhist schools, Hīnayāna (Small Vehicle), Mahāyāna (Great Vehicle), and Vajrayāna (Diamond Vehicle). The Great Vehicle is characterized by its emphasis on compassion and altruistic principles of the bodhisattva path.
theg pa chen po|Vehicle or path of the bodhisattvas; when contrasted with the Śrāvakayāna with respect to its salvific power or goal, the Mahāyāna is characterized by the bodhisattvas’ postponement of their own liberation from saṃsāra and their aspiration to save all sentient beings.
theg pa chen po|The “Great Vehicle” of Buddhism, called “great” because it aims with altruistic intent to transport all living beings to the goal of liberation. It is distinguished from the Hinayāna (Lesser Vehicle), including the Śrāvakayāna (Śrāvaka Vehicle) and Pratyeka buddha yāna (Solitary Buddha Vehicle), which allegedly aims to transport only its followers to their own personal liberation.
theg pa chen po|When the Buddhist teachings are classified according to their power to lead beings to an enlightened state, a distinction is made between the teachings of the Lesser Vehicle, which emphasizes the individual’s own freedom from cyclic existence as the primary motivation and goal, and those of the Great Vehicle, which emphasizes altruism and has the liberation of all sentient beings as the principal objective. As the term “Great Vehicle” implies, the path followed by bodhisattvas is analogous to a large carriage which can transport a vast number of people to liberation, as compared to a smaller vehicle for the individual practitioner. See also “Lesser Vehicle.”
theg pa dam pa|One of the future buddhas of this kalpa.
theg pa dman pa|Literally “the lesser way” or “lesser vehicle.” It is a collective term for the śrāvakayāna and pratyeka buddha yāna, which have nirvāṇa instead of buddhahood as their goal.
theg pa dman pa|This is a collective term used by proponents of the Great Vehicle to refer to the hearer vehicle (śrāvakayāna) and solitary buddha vehicle (pratyeka buddha yāna). The name stems from their goal‍—i.e. nirvāṇa and personal liberation‍—being seen as small or lesser than the goal of the Great Vehicle‍—i.e. buddhahood and the liberation of all sentient beings. See also “Great Vehicle.”
theg pa gsum|The hearer, solitary buddha, and bodhisattva vehicles.
theg pa gsum|The vehicles of the hearers, solitary buddhas, and bodhisattvas.
theg pa gsum|The Śrāvaka Vehicle, the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle, and the Bodhisattva Vehicle.

theg pa gsum|In the context of the sūtras, the three vehicles are the Hearer, Solitary Buddha, and Bodhisattva Vehicles.
theg pa sum|In the context of the sūtras, the three vehicles are the Śrāvaka, the Pratyeka buddha, and the Bodhisattva Vehicles.
theg pa|The Sanskrit has several meanings, including “way,” “carriage,” and “vehicle.”
theg pa|Literally “vehicle” or “way of going,” the three yānas referred to here are the Śrāvaka yāna, Pratyekabuddha yāna, and Bodhisattva yāna.
theg pa|A “way of going,” which primarily means a path or a way. It can also mean a conveyance or carriage; this definition is represented in commentarial literature by the Tibetan translation as “carrier,” and therefore it is also translated into English as “vehicle.”

In this text (see Introduction https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-045-001.html#UT22084-045-001-14670 et seq.) it most often refers, more broadly, to a wide range of teachings and practices that constitute the bodhisattva path.
ting nge 'dzin|Some readers may be familiar with the term samadhi, written without diacritics as it would appear in English dictionaries, where it is usually explained as referring to meditation or meditative states.\nIn a more restricted sense, and when understood as a mental state, samādhi is defined as the one-pointedness of the mind (cittaikāgratā), the ability to remain on the same object over long periods of time. In Vaibhāṣika abhidharma, samādhi is a mental state that accompanies each and every moment of mind; the practice of meditation and the like is for the purpose of making samādhi more powerful (samādhiś cittasyaikagrateti agram ālambanam ity eko 'rthaḥ yadyogāc cittaṃ prabandhena ekatrālambane vartate sa samādhiḥ yadi samādhiḥ sarva cetasi bhavati kim arthaṃ dhyāneṣu yatnaḥ kriyate balavatsamādhiniṣpādanārthaṃ, Abhidharma kośa vyākhyā 2.24,https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4092.html Wogihara 1989, p. 128). Some forms of abhidharma (Yogācāra, for example) do not consider samādhi as a mental factor that accompanies every moment of mind.\nIn a slightly less technical sense, samādhi can describe a number of different meditative states, including the highest such as the “samādhi that is like a diamond” (vajropamasamādhi).\nIf we understand the term samādhi as derived from sam + ā + dhā, the sense is something like to “place together” or “collect.” In the Tibetan rendering of this term, the {'dzin} represents, we think, the root dhā and matches one of the senses of this root, “to hold” (dhāraṇa). The possible etymology of {ting nge} is debated and possibly a complex matter; if we accept the hypothesis that {ting nge} is related to {gting}, then the sense is probably akin to “profound” or “deep,” which may indicate taking sam + ā more or less as intensifiers.\nThe sgra sbyor bam po gnyis pa commentary on the Mahāvyutpatti explains the term samādhi as referring to the instrument through which mind and mental states “get collected,” i.e., it is by the force of samādhi that the continuum of mind and mental states becomes collected on a single point of reference without getting distracted ({samAdhi zhes pa samAdhiyante anena zhes bya ste / ting nge 'dzin gyi mthus sems dang sems las byung ba'i rgyud dmigs pa gcig la sdud cing mi g.yo bar ting nge 'dzin 'jog pas na ting nge 'dzin zhes bya}).

tshangs pa'i gnas pa bzhi|Friendliness, compassion, rejoicing, and equanimity are called “Brahma abodes,” according to the commentarial traditions, because one abides with a mind like that of the deity Brahmā and because they are a cause to be born in the world of Brahmā. It is important to point out, though, that the original Sanskrit compound brahma-vihāra does not specify the gender of the term brahman, which could therefore either refer to Brahmā as a deity or to brahman, meaning more generally “what is most exalted,” as is sometimes simply used in the sense of “sublime” etc. We have therefore attempted to retain the ambiguity by using neither “Brahmā” (which is by common convention used only for the deity) nor “brahman” (which is by common convention used only for “what is most exalted” etc.), but rather “Brahma.”

tshangs par spyod pa|In Buddhism, a term denoting a religious life grounded in renunciation and chastity. In the brahmanical traditions, this refers specifically to the stage in one’s youth dedicated to focused study of religious scripture and practice.
tshangs par spyod pa|While in its narrowest sense this term refers to celibacy, Sonam Angdu explains its broader meaning: {tshangs pa 'am bsil bar gyur pa'i don du na mya ngan 'das pa la bya}, “Those actions that lead beyond sorrow to the goal of purity or peace” (Angdu 62).\nAlso rendered here as “code of conduct,” “celibacy” and “brahmacarya.”
tshangs par spyod pa|Brahman is a Sanskrit term referring to what is highest (parama) and most important (pradhāna); the Nibandhana commentary explains brahman as meaning here nirvāṇa, and thus the brahman conduct is the “conduct toward brahman,” the conduct that leads to the highest liberation, i.e., nirvāṇa. This is explained as “the path without outflows,” which is the “truth of the path” among the four truths of the noble ones. Other explanations (found in the Pāli tradition) take “brahman conduct” to mean the “best conduct,” and also the “conduct of the best,” i.e., the buddhas. In some contexts, “brahman conduct” refers more specifically to celibacy, but the specific referents of this expression are many.

tshangs pa|One of the primary deities of the purāṇic Hindu pantheon, and perhaps the first to take on the status formerly held by the cosmic being Prajāpati in the literature of the brāhmaṇas. Though not considered a creator god in Buddhist literature, in his form as Sahāṃpati Brahmā, Brahmā occupies an important place as one of two deities (the other being Indra/Śakra) that are said to have exhorted Śākyamuni to teach the Dharma. Among his epithets is “Lord of the Sahā World” (Sahāṃpati).
tshangs pa|As one of the three primary deities of the Hindu pantheon, in the Purāṇic cosmogony Brahmā is said to issue the four Vedas (Ṛg, Yajus, Sāma, and Athārva) from his four mouths, from which the entirety of creation unfolds. In Buddhist traditions, Brahmā is said to be a worldly deity who exists at the zenith of cyclic existence. He is thus added to the list of the eight guardians of the directions as the guardian of the zenith. In most narratives of the life of the Buddha, Brahmā is said to appear together with Śakra to request that the Buddha Śākyamuni teach the Dharma.
tshangs pa|A high-ranking deity presiding over a divine world where other beings consider him the creator; he is also considered to be the Lord of the Sahā world (our universe). Though not considered a creator god in Buddhism, Brahmā occupies an important place as one of two deities (the other being Indra/Śakra) that are said to have first exhorted Śākyamuni to teach the Dharma. The particular heavens found in the form realm over which Brahmā rules are often some of the most sought-after realms of higher rebirth in Buddhist literature. Since there are multiple universes and world systems, there are also multiple Brahmās presiding over them.
tshangs pa|One of the primary deities of the Brahmanical pantheon, he is said to have pronounced the mantras of four vedas from each of his four faces and thus established the sonic foundation for the manifestation of the cosmos. Though not considered a creator god in Buddhist literature, in his form as Sahāṃpati Brahmā, Brahmā occupies an important place as one of two deities (the other being Indra/Śakra) that are said to have exhorted Śākyamuni to teach the Dharma in the hagiographic literature. The particular heavens over which Brahmā rules are among the most sought-after realms of higher rebirth in Buddhist literature. Among his epithets is “Lord of Sahā World” (Sahāṃpati).
tshangs pa|One of the primary deities of the Brahmanical pantheon, Brahmā occupies an important place as one of two deities (the other being Indra/Śakra) that are said to have first exhorted Śākyamuni to teach the Dharma. The particular heavens found in the form realm over which Brahmā rules are often some of the most sought after realms of higher rebirth in Buddhist literature. Since there are multiple universes and world systems, there are also multiple Brahmās presiding over them; however, The Question of Mañjuśrī describes sequentially higher brahmā gods as ruling over sequentially more numerous world systems. The image of the singular deity, Brahmā, is depicted as the forty-seventh of the eighty designs on the palms and soles of the Tathāgata.

tshe dang ldan pa|A monk or mendicant of seniority.\nĀyuṣmān ({tshe dang ldan pa}) is a title of respect directed toward a monk or wandering mendicant who is venerable and in a position of seniority, but not a fully realized buddha. (In the Lalita vistara, ch. 26, Śākyamuni famously rejects this title as a suitable term of address for himself. See, e.g., Dudjom Rinpoche 1991: 423). Āyuṣmān may imply one who has held monastic ordination for a significant number of years, and who has some level of realization, but is still “mortal” and tied to cyclic existence, in contrast to the buddhas, who are “immortal.” Even today Thai monks colloquially address each other, using ayusma for someone senior and avuso (“friend”) for someone junior.

yang dag pa'i mtha'|A synonym of the ultimate reality. In the Mahāyāna sūtras, it has a somewhat negative flavor, connoting the Hinayāna concept of a static nirvāṇa. Sthiramati glosses the term as follows: “ ‘Reality’ means undistorted truth. ‘Limit’ means the extreme beyond which there is nothing to be known by anyone” (bhūtaṃ satyam aviparītamityarthaḥ / koṭiḥ paryanto yataḥ pareṇa-anyajjñeyaṃ nāsti…/).
yang dag pa'i mtha'|A synonym for ultimate reality, emptiness, dharmadhātu, and so forth—as either an ontological reality or a state of being—this compound is typically parsed as the “limit” or “frontier” (koṭi) of “reality” (bhūta), which is intended metaphorically, as it is consistently described, in a play on words, as “without limit” (akoṭi) or “infinite” (atyanta). This compound might also be parsed as the “final” or “true” (bhūta) “conclusion” or “goal” (koṭi), although the majority of cases and the Indian Buddhist commentarial tradition tend to support the former interpretation.

yang dag par blangs pa thams cad las rgal ba the tsom gcod pa|Name of the thus-gone one of the world system Gentle Voice.
yang dag par byin pa'i bslab blangs|A great bodhisattva.
yang dag par gshegs pa|A relic of the Sinitic vocabulary in Tibetan texts (see McKeown 2010, 23). {yang dag par gshegs pa} renders Chinese ru lai 如來, which in turn renders Sanskrit tathā + āgata (“thus come”). This was apparently given preference by the Chinese translators of canonical texts over ruqu 如去, Sanskrit tathā + gata (“thus gone”). According to R. A. Stein, Tibetan translators, while aware that ru lai 如來 was a translation of the Sanskrit compound tathāgata , chose to translate ru lai as {yang dag par gshegs pa} “perfectly (or purely) come (or gone).” By thus deviating from the original sense of the epithet they indirectly marked the Tibetan translation as potentially Chinese in origin (McKeown 2010, 23).
yang dag par ldan pa'i lung|The Connected Discourses, one of the four divisions of the Sūtrapiṭaka.

yang dag par rdzogs pa'i sangs rgyas|A term used to emphasize the superiority of buddhahood when contrasted with the achievement of the arhats and pratyekabuddhas. A samyaksaṃbuddha is considered superior by virtue of his compassionate activity, his omniscience and his ten special powers.

yang dag par spang ba|Four types of relinquishment of abandoning existing negative mind states, abandoning the production of such states, giving rise to virtuous mind states that are not yet produced, and letting those states continue.
yang dag par spong ba bzhi|Ensuring that nonvirtuous qualities do not arise and are eliminated if they do; ensuring that virtuous qualities arise and ensuring that they remain and increase when they have arisen.
yang dag par spong ba bzhi|The four perfect endeavors are (1) relinquishing the existing evils and nonvirtues, (2) not giving rise to evils and nonvirtues currently absent, (3) giving rise to virtues not yet present, and (4) increasing virtues already developed.
yang dag par spong ba bzhi|Four types of right effort consisting in (1) abandoning existing negative mind states, (2) abandoning the production of such states, (3) giving rise to virtuous mind states that are not yet produced, and (4) letting those states continue.
yang dag par spong ba bzhi|The four right exertions (sometimes translated literally from the Tibetan as “abandonments”) aim at preventing the negative dharmas from arising, at removing those that have arisen, at producing those that have not arisen, and at maintaining those that have arisen. The Tibetan term, as exemplified in this text, may translate both the Sanskrit terms samyakprahāṇa and samyakpraṇidhiṃ.
yang dag par spong ba bzhi|These are effort not to initiate sins not yet arisen; effort to eliminate sins already arisen; effort to initiate virtues not yet arisen; and effort to consolidate, increase, and not deteriorate virtues already arisen. For our use of “effort” (samyak pradhāna) instead of lit. “abandonment” (samyak prahāna) see Dayal, p. 102 ff. These four form a part of the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment.
yang dag par spong ba bzhi|That the translation of this term should not follow the Tibetan literally (which would yield “four kinds of abandoning”) is widely agreed. It is possible that the Tibetan translators may originally have confused the meaning in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit (BHS) of the term prahāṇa (“priority”) with its meaning in classical Sanskrit (“elimination”). The classical Sanskrit equivalent of BHS prahāṇa is pradhāna. See Dayal, p. 102 ff.
yang dag par spong ba|These are four: preventing the arising of evil that has not arisen, eliminating the evil that has arisen, generating good qualities that have not arisen, and maintaining good qualities that have arisen.
yang dag par spong ba|Four types of relinquishment: abandoning existing negative mind states, abandoning the production of such states, giving rise to virtuous mind states that are not yet produced, and letting those states continue.
yang dag par spong ba|The four correct exertions are (1) abandoning existing negative mental states, (2) abandoning the production of such states, (3) giving rise to virtuous states of mind that are not yet produced, (4) and letting those states continue.
yang dag par spong ba|There are four kinds: the intention to not do bad actions that have not been done, to give up bad actions that are being done, to do good actions that have not been done, and to increase the good actions that are being done. Exertion is in accordance with the meaning in Buddhist Sanskrit. The Tibetan is translated as “abandonment” as in classical Sanskrit, which does not fit the context.
yang dag par spong ba|Relinquishing negative acts in the present and future and enhancing positive acts in the present and future. These are among the thirty-seven factors of awakening. The term is often translated “true relinquishments,” which is the literal meaning of both the Sanskrit and Tibetan, but does not fit the third and fourth; Dayal, p. 102 ff. suggests the use of “effort” (samyak pradhāna) instead of lit. “abandonment” (samyak prahāna).
yang dag par spong ba|Refers here to the four correct exertions that belong to the thirty-seven factors conducive to awakening. The Sanskrit term samyakprahāṇa is generally translated as either "right exertion(s)” or “right abandonment(s),” depending on whether one follows the primary connotation “exertion” ( pradhāna, lit. “priority”) or the secondary (nirukta) derived connotation “abandonment” (prahāṇa). The four are the intention to not do bad actions that have not been done, to give up bad actions that are being done, to do good actions that have not been done, and to increase the good actions that are being done.
yang dag pa|Lit. “genuineness” or “authenticity.” The quality or condition of things as they really are, which cannot be conveyed in conceptual, dualistic terms. Akin to other terms rendered here as “as it really is,” “suchness,” and “natural state.”

yang dag spong ba bzhi|Four types of right effort consisting in (1) abandoning existing negative mind states, (2) abandoning the production of such states, (3) giving rise to virtuous mind states that are not yet produced, and (4) letting those states continue.
yang dag spong ba|The four correct exertions are (1) abandoning existing negative mental states, (2) abandoning the production of such states, (3) giving rise to virtuous states of mind that are not yet produced, (4) and letting those states continue.
yang dag|A yakṣa in this tantra. Although {yang dag} is normally translated as “Viśuddha,” we have rendered it here as “Samprajñāna” since this is the Sanskrit rendering of this particular yakṣa’s name in the list of name mantras at 2.14.

ye shes|Specifically refers to an awakened being’s wisdom. Also translated as “transcendental wisdom,” “original wakefulness,” and so forth.
ye shes|Also known as “pristine awareness,” “primordial wisdom,” “primordial awareness,” “gnosis,” or the like. Typically refers to nonconceptual or unobscured states of knowledge.
ye shes|This term denotes the modality of buddha mind. Although all sentient beings possess the potential for actualizing gnosis within their mental continuum, the psychological confusions and deluded tendencies which defile the mind obstruct the natural expression of these inherent potentials, making them appear instead as aspects of mundane consciousness.
ye shes|Although the Sanskrit term jñāna can refer to knowledge in a general sense, it is often used in Buddhist texts to refer to the mode of awareness of a realized being. In contrast to ordinary knowledge, which mistakenly perceives phenomena as real entities having real properties, wisdom perceives the emptiness of phenomena, their lack of intrinsic essence.
ye shes|This term denotes the mode of awareness of a realized being. Although all sentient beings possess the potential for actualizing transcendental knowledge within their mind streams, mental obscurations make them appear instead as aspects of mundane consciousness. Also known as “pristine awareness,” “primordial wisdom,” “primordial awareness,” “gnosis,” or the like.
ye shes|The term jñāna is formed by the root jñā, meaning “to know,” “to know of,” “to understand,” “to be aware of,” with the addition of the pratyaya lyuṭ, which can be interpreted as having different values (the instrument of awareness, its agent, or the action of awareness). We have chosen “awareness” as it was the only that seemed to fit for two important (and not unrelated) contexts wherein jñāna is used: awareness of something, and nonobjective, nonconceptual awareness. In Tibetan the two senses are sometimes distinguished by using {shes pa} and {ye shes}, respectively, but the distinction in the usage of these two terms is not clearly marked in works that are translations from the Sanskrit, and hence it is less relevant for the Kangyur than it may be for indigenous Tibetan works. The nature of jñāna and its relationship with “wisdom” (prajñā) is the topic of one of the chapters of the Abhidharmakośa https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4089.html and is also thematized in a number of Mahāyāna sūtras and śāstras.

yi dags|The Sanskrit preta literally means “departed” and generally refers to the spirits of the dead.

yongs su bsdu ba'i tshul|The four methods of attracting pupils are generosity, pleasant speech, beneficial conduct, and conduct that accords with the wishes of pupils.
yongs su bsngo ba|Dedication of the merit at the end of a spiritual practice or virtuous action, usually for the attainment of full enlightenment by all sentient beings. In this way the actions thus dedicated contribute to the purpose of attaining enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings.
yongs su bsngo ba|The establishment of the correct motivation at the beginning of any practice or endeavor and the altruistic dedication at the end are regarded as highly significant. The most popular objects of the dedication are the flourishing of the sacred teachings of Buddhism throughout the universe and the attainment of full enlightenment by all sentient beings.
yongs su bsngo ba|This refers to the bodhisattva’s constant mindfulness of the fact that all his actions of whatever form contribute to his purpose of attaining enlightenment for the sake of himself and others, i.e., his conscious deferral of the merit accruing from any virtuous action as he eschews immediate reward in favor of ultimate enlightenment for himself and all living beings.
yongs su bsngo ba|Although the Sanskrit term pariṇāmanā is often translated as “dedication” (as in the practice of dedicating merit), the term has the basic meaning of “transforming,” “developing,” “making ripen.” This conception, then, reflects the Buddhist understanding that the act of dedication involves mentally or ritually directing the merit ( puṇya ) produced from virtuous activity toward a specific goal, be it worldly or transworldly. In this text, we can observe that the idea of dedication is closely linked with the idea of karmic ripening or maturation (vipaka). It is also noteworthy that dedication can be wrongly practiced, as when the text speaks of six perfections that are dedicated through wrong view ( https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-045-001.html#UT22084-045-001-342 ).

zag pa|A term of Jain origin, literally meaning “inflows” or “influx.” It refers to the uncontrolled flow of thoughts toward sensory objects and the resulting contamination of the individual. It is also defined as “outflows,” as reflected in the Tibetan {zag pa} (“leak”).
zag pa|A term of Jain origin, meaning “inflows.” It refers to uncontrolled thoughts as a result of being influenced by sensory objects and thus being sullied or defiled. It is also defined as “outflows,” hence the Tibetan {zag pa} (“leaks”) as the mind is “flowing out” toward the sensory objects.
zag pa|The metaphor explaining outflows (āsrava), rendered as “contaminated,” is a house with a faulty roof. But it does not simply mean that something from the outside, hatred or greed, drips in on the pristine mind of a person. Rather the drips come from within the person. They arise from unskillful mindsets that give rise to the afflictions, hence “outflows” rather than “inflows.”
zag pa|Literally, “to flow” or “to ooze.” Mental defilements or contaminations that “flow out” toward the objects of cyclic existence, binding us to them. Vasubandhu offers two alternative explanations of this term: “They cause beings to remain (āsayanti) within saṃsāra” and “They flow from the Summit of Existence down to the Unwavering, out of the six wounds that are the entrances” (āsayanti saṃsāre āsravanti bhavāgrādyāvadavīciṃ ṣaḍbhir āyatana vraṇair ityāsravāḥ, Abhidharma kośa bhāṣya on 5.40,https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4090.html Pradhan 1967, p. 308). The “Summit of Existence” is the highest point within saṃsāra, while the hell called “Unwavering” is the lowest; the six entrances here refer to the five sense faculties plus the mind, i.e., the six internal entrances in the scheme of twelve entrances.
zag pa|A term meaning literally “to flow toward” or “stream outward.” Mental defilements or contaminations that “flow out” toward the objects of cyclic existence, binding us to them. Vasubandhu offers two alternative explanations of this term: “They cause beings to remain (āsayanti) within saṃsāra” and “They flow from the Summit of Existence down to the Unwavering, out of the six wounds that are the entrances” (āsayanti saṃsāre āsravanti bhavāgrādyāvadavīciṃ ṣaḍbhir āyatana vraṇair ityāsravāḥ, Abhidharma kośa bhāṣya on 5.40,https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4090.html Pradhan 1967, p. 308). The “Summit of Existence” is the highest point within saṃsāra, while the hell called “Unwavering” is the lowest; the six entrances here refer to the five sense faculties plus the mind, i.e., the six internal entrances in the scheme of twelve entrances.
zag pa|Most of the explanations of the term āsrava derive it from the root sru (“to flow,” “to ooze”) and understand the preverb ā- variously either as “flowing in,” “flowing out from,” or simply emphasizing the action of flowing. The Tibetan translation also translates the sense of the root but does not explicitly render the preverb; zag pa is attested as a translation of several other Sanskrit terms that mean “to flow,” “to ooze,” etc. (sravaḥ, srāvaṇam, syandī, etc.; see Negi vol. 12, p. 5353). The derivation from ā + sru follows clear grammatical principles (vyākaraṇa); furthermore, there is another derivation from the root ās (“to sit,” “to remain”), which is in accordance with etymology by sound association (nirukti).\nVasubandhu offers two alternatives: “They cause beings to remain (āsayanti) within saṃsāra” and “They flow from the Summit of Existence down to the Unwavering, out of the six wounds that are the entrances” (āsayanti saṃsāre āsravanti bhavāgrādyāvadavīciṃ ṣaḍbhir āyatana vraṇair ityāsravāḥ, Abhidharma kośa bhāṣya on 5.40,https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4090.html Pradhan 1967, p. 308). The “Summit of Existence” is the highest point within saṃsāra, while the hell called “Unwavering” is the lowest; the six entrances here refer to the five sense faculties plus the mind, i.e., the six internal entrances in the scheme of twelve entrances.\nThe Pāli tradition offers similar derivations. For example, the commentary on The Sutta on All the Āsavas explains the term āsava in the following ways:\n“They flow (āsavanti), thus they are āsavas: even from the eye, up to even from thought, they ooze, they come about—this is what is being said here” (āsavantīti āsavā, cakkhutopi . . . pe . . . manatopi sandanti pavattantīti vuttaṃ hoti, Aṭṭhakathā on the Sabbāsavasutta.) (This explanation matches quite closely the second one in the Abhidharma kośa bhāṣya https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4090.html.) The “up to” here reproduces the pe, an abbreviation meant to convey an incomplete list. The complete list would be “even from the eye, even from the ear, even from the nose, even from the tongue, even from the body, even from thought”—i.e., the list of the six internal entrances.\n“Alternatively, from the dhammas to the gotrabhū, from space to the Summit of Existence, they flow, thus they are āsavas. Entering inside these dhammas and this space, they come about—this is the sense; for this ā- has the sense of ‘entering inside’ ” (dhammato yāva gotrabhuṃ okāsato yāva bhavaggaṃ savantīti vā āsavā ete dhamme etañ ca okāsaṃ anto karitvā pavattantīti attho. antokaraṇattho hi ayaṃ ākāro Aṭṭhakathā on the Sabbāsavasutta).\n“ ‘Liquor and so forth are āsavas’ in the sense that they stay in one place for a long time; since they are ‘like the āsavas,’ these are ‘āsavas.’ For, in this world, liquor and so forth that stay in one place for a long time are called āsavas. And if they are āsavas in the sense that they stay in one place for a long time, these indeed are worthy of being so. For, it has been said, ‘A prior limit, bhikkhus, is not found for ignorance, wherein one could say that “before this there was no ignorance,” and so forth’ ” (cirapārivāsiyaṭṭhena madirādayo āsavā āsavā viyātipi āsavā. lokasmiñ hi cirapārivāsikā madirādayo āsavāti vuccanti yadi ca cirapārivāsiyaṭṭhena āsavā eteyeva bhavitum arahanti vuttañ hetaṃ purimā bhikkhave koṭi na paññāyati avijjāya ito pubbe avijjā nāhosītiādi Aṭṭhakathā on the Sabbāsavasutta A.Ni.10.61).\n“Alternatively, they ooze, they ooze forth, future suffering of saṃsāra—thus they are āsavas” (āyataṃ vā saṃsāradukkhaṃ savanti pasavantītipi āsavā, Aṭṭhakathā on the Sabbāsavasutta).\nFrom all this, we conclude that (1) the derivation from the root sru (“to flow” etc.) is in some ways primary, and it follows principles of grammar (vyākaraṇa) rather than those of etymology by sound association (nirukti), as Yaśomitra clarifies is the case for the etymology from ās (“to sit” etc.); (2) the value of the preverb ā- was understood variously (“from,” “out of,” or as an intensifier), thus it is impossible to decide whether to render it as “in,” “out,” etc.; (3) translators who chose {zag pa} to render āsrava were most likely aware of both the above points.\nConsidering all the above, we have opted for “fluxes” rather than “influences” or “outflows.”
