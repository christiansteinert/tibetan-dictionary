#nang don rig pa'i ming tshig {{bod bad byin shan sbyar/}}|Tibetan-English\nDictionary of\nBuddhast Termivised and Enlarged Edition)\nTsepak Rigdzin\nLibrary of tibetan works and archives\nISBN: 81-85102-88-0\nPublished by the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, Dharamsala, and printed at Indraprastha Press (CBT), 4 Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi-110 002\nForeword\nIt gives us pleasure to bring out this second edition of the Tibetan-English Dictionary of Buddhist Terminology. The present edition has been revised and upgraded since it's first, and has been expanded with hundreds of new entries from various sources. For example, many new words have been added to the selected lists of terms from the Mahavyutpatti ({bye brag tu rtogs par byed pa chen mo}) and from many other collected writings and lexicons. Attempts have been made to provide Sanskrit equivalents wherever possible in Romanised transliterated form with care. The English translations and definitions have been selected to provide a general meaning aimed at leading to a deeper understanding of Buddhist concepts.\nOf course, a project of such encyclopedic scope would be exceedingly difficult to complete single-handedly, if not impossible. Nonetheless, Mr. Tsepak Rigzin of the Library's Translation Bureau is to be recognized and congratulated for his vision in undertaking such a timely project, as well as for his painstaking labour.\nIt is hoped that this Dictionary will not only serve as a reference tool but also as a handy book for providing overview of Tibetan Buddhism. Both students and scholars of Tibetan Buddhist culture will find it useful.\nGyatsho Tshering DIRECTOR\nIntroduction\nWhen I was informed that a revised edition of my previous Tibetan-English Dictionary of Buddhist Terminology was due, I was immediately reminded of both the features (and the flaws) of the first edition. Having never seen myself as a Tibetan Buddhist studies scholar or as a qualified translator, I must confess that the compliments and criticisms that I have received have been extremely rewarding. The entire process of compiling this dictionary, from beginning to end, has been an extremely rewarding learning experience. Over two thousand new entries have been incorporated in this edition—all within the short period of time derived from maximum usage of my office hours as well as of my weekend holidays. With the exception of some minor editing and changes, the majority of these new entries have been directly translated from the glossary found in the three volumes of the Grand Tibetan-Chinese Dictionary.\nMany of the first edition's redundant entries have been reduced to a minimum by giving cross references wherever possible in Tibetan transliterated form following the Turrell Wylie system of transliteration. Attempts have been made to occasionally provide Sanskrit equivalents in romanised transliterated form based on the standard dictionaries (primarily splitting the words for better comprehension). The purpose of incorporating Sanskrit in romanised form is to enable more advanced students to go into a deeper study and research. Every care has been taken in revising and editing the Sanskrit words provided herein; although I do not claim these to be absolutely free of flaws. Readers are therefore advised to take care and caution while using these words. In all, I hope that the modifications and changes I have made will prove helpful to all readers. The unfortunate presence of any overlooked mistakes in this dictionary reflects the sheer gift of my own ignorance and carelessness.\nFinally, I would like to add that the production of this edition has been a gross experience of the interdependent nature of my own life and the lives of my associates. Th'e biggest change has been the Library's purchase of a computer (an advantage not known during its first edition); but also the assistance of many well wishers and scholars. It is to these people that I give my inexpressible thanks: to the many teachers in my life who taught me everything from the alphabet to philosophy; Ku-Ngo Gyatsho Tshering, Director of this institute, for his unflagging interest and encouragement; Jeremy Russell, for his many years of association at the Translation Bureau; Ms. Marguerite Mullins for her moral support; Robert Moyer for his editorial assistance in revising the english part and Mr. Sangye Tandar, LTWA's Tibetan Language Officer for revising the Tibetan spellings; Dr. Christoph Cuppers, a learned Tibetologist friend, for his generous time and erudition in revising and editing the Sanskrit equivalents and for providing extremely valuable suggestions; Mr. Tsering Dhendup, our Computer Geshe for his guidance through the computer world; and finally to Scott Heftier, for finalization—design, layout, formatting, proof-reading, and incorporating corrections. Mr. Heftler's work was done on a Macintosh Classic that was kindly made available by the Tibetan Medical Institute's Dr. Namgyal Qusa'r.\nAs always, I thank all those whose moral support has actually caused me to move along with this project.\nTsepak Rigzin\nResearch and Translation Officer Library of Tibetan Works & Archives Dharamsala
