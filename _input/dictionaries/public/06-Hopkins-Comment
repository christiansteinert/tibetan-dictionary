bag chags brtan byung|Comment: Saying "stable predispositions" distinguishes between consciousnesses polluted by a superficial cause of error and those which are not. Predispositions giving rise to direct perceptions are stable in the sense that their continuum will continue as long as does cyclic existence; those that give rise to wrong consciousnesses such as a sense consciousness seeing blue snow mountains or a conceptual consciousness apprehending sound as permanent are unstable in that their continuum can be adventitiously cut off.

bcom ldan 'das|Comment: This term is translated in accordance with the etymology favored in Tibet, where it is recognized that bhagavan also can be etymologized as "one who possesses the six goodnesses" (legs pa drug dang ldan pa), which seems to fit the more widely used translation as "Blessed One."
bdag|Comment: it is said that in general "self," "person," (gang zag, pudgala) and "I" (nga, ahaM) are equivalent, in the particular context of the selflessness of persons "self" and "person" are not at all equivalent and do not at all have the same meaning. In the term "selflessness of persons," "self" refers to a falsely imagined status that needs to be refuted, whereas "persons" refers to existent beings who are the bases with respect to which that refutation is made. All four Buddhist schools, therefore, hold that persons exist; they do not claim that persons are mere fictions of ignorance.

Gung-tang reports that Maheshvara (Great Lord) is called "Bliss-Arising" not because he himself becomes blissful in dependence upon the goddess Uma but because his body is so supremely satisfying that when others see it, all virtues, including liberation, as well as temporary happiness arise. This is why Maheshvara is called a source of joy.

dge ba|virtue; Comment: Virtuous mental factors are one of six main groupings of mental factors (sems byung, caitta): (1) five omnipresent (kun 'gro, sarvatraga) mental factors; (2) five determining (yul nges, viSaya-pratiniyama) mental factors; (3) eleven virtuous (dge ba, kuzala) mental factors; (4) six root afflictions (rtsa nyon, mUla-kleza); (5) twenty secondary afflictions (nye nyong, upakleza); and (6) four changeable (gzhan 'gyur, anyathAbhAva) mental factors. "Indicated" or "revealed" (lung du bstan pa) means here "that which abides as either virtue or non-virtue." Thus, in this case of defining virtue, it means that which is virtuous. It means that which is definite as virtuous or non-virtuous. It does not necessarily refer to Buddha's having said it this way or that way which is what those words often mean ("indicated in scripture"). "Abides in the class of that which issues forth happiness" is said because there are, for instance, virtues which have been overcome by hatred and do not issue forth happiness, but they are still virtues. The phrase means that there are exceptions that merely "abide in the class of."

Since thought and intention are posited in different ways with respect to one non-literal sUtra, [a sUtra having an] intention and [a sUtra having a] thought must be asserted as mutually inclusive. The basis in [Buddha's] thought is just what the Teacher has set in [his] mind and is not relative to another, the trainee, and purpose definitely must rely on another, the trainee, since it is for sake of taking care of another. See Ann, dngos, 134.5.
dgongs pa can|Comment: See dgongs pa.
dgra bcom|Comment: Arhan/ arhant (dgra bcom pa) is translated as "Foe Destroyer" to accord with the usual Tibetan translation of the term and to assist in capturing the flavor of oral and written traditions that frequently refer to this etymology. Arhats have overcome the foe which is the afflictive emotions (nyon mongs, kleza), the chief of which is ignorance, the conception (according to the Consequence School) that persons and phenomena are established by way of their own character.\n The Indian and Tibetan translators were also aware of the etymology of arhant as "worthy one," as they translated the name of the "founder" of the Jaina system, Arhat, as mchod 'od "Worthy of Worship" (see Jam-y#ang-shay-b#a's Great Exposition of Tenets, ka, 62a.3). Also, they were aware of ChandrakIrti's gloss of the term as "Worthy One" in his Clear Words: "Because of being worthy of worship by the world of gods, humans, and demi-gods, they are called Arhats" (sadevamAnuøAsurAl lokAt pUnArhatvAd arhannityuchyate [Poussin, 486.5], lha dang mi dang lha ma yin du bcas pa'i 'jig rten gyis mchod par 'os pas dgra bcom pa zhes brjod la [P5260, vol. 98 75.2.2]). Also, they were aware of Haribhadra's twofold etymology in his Illumination of the Eight Thousand Stanza Perfection of Wisdom SUtra. In the context of the list of epithets qualifying the retinue of Buddha at the beginning of the sUtra (see Unrai Wogihara, ed., AbhisamayAla™kArAlokA PrajJA-pAramitA-vyAkhyA, The Work of Haribhadra [Tokyo: The Toyo Bunko, 1932-5; reprint ed., Tokyo: Sankibo Buddhist Book Store, 1973], 8.18), Haribhadra says, "They are called arhant [=Worthy One, from root arh 'to be worthy'] since they are worthy of worship, religious donations, and being assembled together in a group, etc." (W9.8-9: sarva evAtra pUjA-dakøi˜A-ga˜a-parikarøAdy-Arhatayar-han-taH; P5189, 67.5.7: 'dir thams cad kyang mchod pa dang // yon dang tshogs su 'dub la sogs par 'os pas na dgra bcom pa'o).\nAlso, "They are called arhant [= Foe Destroyer, arihan] because they have destroyed (hata) the foe (ari)."\n(W10.18: hatAritvAd arhantaH; P5189, 69.3.6. dgra rnams bcom pas na dgra bcom pa'o). Thus, this is a considered preference in the face of alternative etymologies—"Foe Destroyer" requiring a not unusual i infix to make ari-han, ari meaning enemy and han meaning to kill, and thus "Foe Destroyer." Unfortunately, one word in English cannot convey both this meaning and "Worthy of Worship"; thus, I have gone with what clearly has become the predominant meaning in Tibet. (For an excellent discussion of the two etymologies of "Arhat" in Buddhism and Jainism, see L.M. Joshi's "Facets of Jaina Religiousness in Comparative Light," L.D. Series 85, [Ahmedabad: L.D. Institute of Indology, May 1981], 53-58).

dmigs yul|Comment: In the Mind-Only School, the thoroughly established nature is the final object of observation by a path of purification, and indeed such a path observes, or apprehends, it; however, despite the fact that phenomena such as chairs are objects of observation of a path of purification, they are not observed or apprehended by it — they are only bases with respect to which emptiness is realized. Hence, the term "object of observation" in this context, as it has come to used in Ge-luk-b#a scholarship, is somewhat misleading. The usage of the term " objects of observation" even for objects that are not being observed may have come from systems that hold that even during direction perception of emptiness the phenomena qualified by emptiness still appear; this is called "meditative equipoise with appearance" (mnyam bzhag snang bcas). D#zong-ka-b#a earlier in his life held this notion but then switched to the opinion that the objects qualified by emptiness do not appear during meditative equipoise (mnyam bzhag snang med). His own commentary (legs bshad gser 'phreng) on Maitreya's Ornament for Clear Realization reflects his earlier notion, whereas his student Gyel-tsap's commentary (rnam bzhad snying po rgyan) reflects his later view.

Non-entities here are imputational natures which include other-powered natures and thus are all conventionalities.

don dam pa|Comment: An equivalent of ultimate truth (don dam bden pa, paramArthasatya) so called because it is the object of the activity of Superiors' exalted wisdom of meditative equipoise; "highest" (dam pa, parama) is taken as the exalted wisdom of uncontaminated meditative equipoise, and "object" (don, artha) is taken as the thusness, or emptiness, that is the object of that exalted wisdom, whereby thusness is called the truth that is the object of the highest [wisdom] (dam pa'i don, paramasya artha-satya). In another interpretation, that wisdom itself is called the highest object (don dam pa, parama-artha), since it is both highest and object; emptiness is called the truth of the highest object (don dam pa'i bden pa, parama-arthasya satya).

The first meaning refers to thoroughly established natures, which are the actual ultimate-non-nature since they are both (1) the ultimate as the object of observation by a path of purification and (2) the very non-nature, that is, the absence of the opposite of emptiness in phenomena. The second meaning refers to fact that other-powered natures are not the ultimate; just as other-powered natures are natureless in terms of (self-)production, so they are natureless in terms of the ultimate — that is to say, they lack being that nature which is the ultimate. Thus, thoroughly established natures are "ultimate-non-natures," and other-powered natures are also "ultimate-non-natures" but for different reasons--the first is the ultimate and the second is not.

don dam bden pa|ultimate truths are understood in different ways by the various Buddhist systems; see definition headingComment: The Sanskrit for "ultimate truth," paramArthasatya, is etymologized three ways within identifying parama as "highest" or "ultimate," artha as "object," and satya as "truth." In the first way, parama (highest, ultimate) refers to a consciousness of meditative equipoise directly realizing emptiness; artha (object) refers to the object of that consciousness, emptiness; and satya (truth) also refers to emptiness in that in direct perception emptiness appears the way it exists; that is, there is no discrepancy between the mode of appearance and the mode of being. In this interpretation, a paramArthasatya is a "truth-that-is-an-object-of-the-highest-consciousness." In the second way, both parama (highest, ultimate) and artha (object) refer to a consciousness of meditative equipoise directly realizing emptiness in that, in the broadest meaning of "object," both objects and subjects are objects, and a consciousness of meditative equipoise directly realizing emptiness is the highest consciousness and thus highest object; satya (truth), as before, refers to emptiness. In this second interpretation, a paramArthasatya is an emptiness that exists the way it appears to a highest consciousness, a "truth-of-a-highest-object." In the third etymology, all three parts refer to emptiness in that an emptiness is the highest (the ultimate) and is also an object and a truth, a "truth-that-is-the-highest-object." ChandrakIrti, the chief Consequentialist, favors the third etymology in his Clear Words

gang zag|Comment: Ken-sur Nga-w#ang-lek-den etymologized this is "full-fall", i.e., one who is filled with the afflictions and has fallen into cyclic existence. As he said, this is not true of all persons, because even a Buddha, for instance, is a person. It is to be noted that animals, for instance, are persons. It is said that in general "self" (bdag, Atman) "person," and "I" (nga, ahaM) are equivalent, but in the particular context of the selflessness of persons "self" and "person" are not at all equivalent and do not at all have the same meaning. In the term "selflessness of persons," "self" refers to a falsely imagined status that needs to be refuted, whereas "persons" refers to existent beings who are the bases with respect to which that refutation is made. All four Buddhist schools, therefore, hold that persons exist; they do not claim that persons are mere fictions of ignorance. The schools hold differing opinions on the nature of the person. According to Ge-luk-b#a scholars, all except the Middle Way Consequence School posit something from within the bases of imputation of a person — usually either mind or the collection of mind and body — as being the person. In contrast, the Consequence School holds that, even though a person is imputed in dependence upon mind and body (in the Formless Realm, a person is imputed in dependence only on mind), the person is neither mind nor body nor a collection of mind and body, since it is just the I that is imputed in dependence upon mind and body. Following the lead of ChandrakIrti, recognized by most as the founder of the Consequence School, Ge-luk-b#a scholars identify how in the other schools some factor among the five aggregates (forms, feelings, discriminations, compositional factors, and consciousnesses) or the collection of them is considered to be the person when sought analytically from among its bases of imputation: the Proponents of the Great Exposition, in general, hold that the mere collection of the mental and physical aggregates is the person; however, some of the five SaMmitIya subschools of the Great Exposition School maintain that all five aggregates are the person (although the absurdity of one person being five persons would seem difficult not to notice) while another subschool, the Avantaka, asserts that the mind alone is the person; the SUtra School Following Scripture assert that the continuum of the aggregates is the person; the SUtra School Following Reasoning maintains that the mental consciousness is the person; the Mind-Only School Following Scripture holds that the mind-basis-of-all (kun gzhi rnam par shes pa, AlayavijJAna) is the person; the Mind-Only School Following Reasoning asserts that the mental consciousness is the person; both the Yogic Autonomy School and the SUtra Autonomy School assert that a subtle, neutral mental consciousness is the person. For the most part, the delineation of what these schools assert to be the person is a matter of conjecture and not reporting of forthright statements in these schools' own texts. Though it is clear that most of these schools (if not all) accept that persons exist, it is often not clear in their own literature that they assert that something from within the bases of imputation of a person is the person. Rather, as presented in Vasubandhu's commentary on the ninth chapter of his Treasury of Manifest Knowledge, persons are merely asserted to be "non-associated compositional factors" (ldan min 'du byed, viprayuktasaMskAra) and thus an instance of the fourth aggregate, compositional factors, without a specific identification — of any of the five aggregates that are a person's bases of imputation — as the person.

The basis in [Buddha's] thought is just what the Teacher has set in [his] mind and is not relative to another, the trainee, and purpose definitely must rely on another, the trainee, since it is for sake of taking care of another.

kham gyi zas|Comment: One of the four foods, which according to (1) morsel food (kham gyi zas, kavaDaMkAra-AhAra), (2) contact food (reg pa'i zas, sparza-AhAra) which is contaminated touch that increases the great elements associated with the sense powers, (3) intention food (sems pa'i zas, manaHsaMcetanAhAra) which is intention (or attention) that involves hope for a desired object, and (4) consciousness food (rnam shes kyi zas, vijJAna-AhAra) which is the collections of consciousness. S#er-s#hül L#o-sang-pün-tsok (Notes, 13b.5) cites the third chapter of Vasubandhu's Treasury of Manifest Knowledge (III.119-128) which indicates that:\n* coarse food furthers the body that is the support of this lifetime\n* contact furthers the mind that depends on the support of the body\n* intention projects future lifetimes (in that it is the main feature of karma)\n* the karmas that actualize future lifetimes in the sense of filling in the details of the lifetime projected by intention are posited as consciousness.\nS#er-s#hül quotes Vasubandhu's explanation that morsel food exists only in the Desire Realm whereas the other three exist in all three realms—Desire, Form, and Formless—and are necessarily contaminated. As Ge-s#hay B#el-den-drak-b#a explained, the foods increase cyclic existence, and thus uncontaminated contact, intention, and consciousness are not posited as food. S#er-s#hül paraphrases AsaGga's Compendium of Ascertainments which explains that although meditative absorptions and engaging in pure behavior are means of furthering the body through eliminating unfavorable circumstances, they are not posited as foods since they do not further the body by way of their own entities. His point must be that meditative stabilization therefore should not be included in the list.\n Contrary to this, Geshe Gedün Lodrö of the University of Hamburg includes meditative stabilization (ting nge 'dzin) and gives mental food as the second (Calm Abiding and Special Insight, 70-71):\n"The four types of nourishment are (1) coarse food, (2) mental nourishment, (3) nourishment of intention, and (4) nourishment of consciousness. The sense of mental satisfaction that comes when a desire is fulfilled is called mental nourishment. Just as coarse food nourishes the body, so satisfaction nourishes or replenishes the mind upon fulfillment of a desire. The third type, nourishment of intention, is an action that projects the next lifetime. Since it generates or produces the next lifetime, it is called a nourisher, or nourishment; it is the second link of the twelve-linked dependent-arising. Similarly, the third link, which is called consciousness, is known as the food of consciousness. Just as the action that projects, or impels, a future lifetime is called a nourisher, so the consciousness which is imprinted with that action and which will at the time of the effect of that action in the future life be imprinted with other karmas is called a nourisher, or nourishment. Why is [the first link of dependent-arising,] ignorance, not called a nourisher? It is because ignorance is the agent that pervades everything; thus, it is not singled out as a nourisher. There is still another type of nourishment, that of meditative stabilization. Persons who have achieved calm abiding and special insight and have proceeded to high levels of the path do not need to use coarse food; they have the nourishment of meditative stabilization.

ldem por dgongs pa|Comment: dgongs pa (abhiprAyA) is often mistranslated as "intention." As Bel-den-chö-jay says:\n\n"Thought" (dgongs pa) is [posited] from the viewpoint of indicating the basis in [Buddha's] thought, "Thinking of this, [such and such] was said," and "intention" (ldem dgongs) is [posited] from the viewpoint of indicating purpose, "[Such and such] was said for this purpose." Since thought and intention are posited in different ways with respect to one non-literal sUtra, [a sUtra having an] intention and [a sUtra having a] thought must be asserted as mutually inclusive. The basis in [Buddha's] thought is just what the Teacher has set in [his] mind and is not relative to another, the trainee, and purpose definitely must rely on another, the trainee, since it is for sake of taking care of another. See Ann, dngos, 134.5.\n\nFour Intentions:\nIntending entry [into the teaching] (gzhug pa la ldem por dgongs pa, avatAranAbhisaMdhi)\nIntending the [three] characters (mtshan nyid la ldem por dgongs pa, lakSaNAbhisaMdhi)\nIntending an antidote (gnyen po la ldem por dgongs pa, pratipakSAbhisaMdhi)\nIntending translation (sbyor ba la ldem por dgongs pa/ bsgyur ba la ldem por dgongs pa, pariNAmAbhisaMdhi)\n\nFour Thoughts\nThinking of sameness (mnyam pa nyid la dgongs pa, samatAbhiprAya)\nThinking of another meaning (don gzhan la dgongs pa, arthAntarAbhiprAya)\nThinking of another time (dus gzhan la dgongs pa, kAlAntarAbhiprAya)\nThinking of a person's attitude (gang zag gi bsam pa la dgongs pa, pudgalAntarAbhiprAya)

According to Gung-tang, he shot his five arrows — which cause arrogance, dullness, thorough obscuration, fainting, and mindlessness while Maheshvara was dwelling in asceticism in union with the goddess Uma, thereby causing Maheshvara to fall from his practice. Understanding that this was done by a demon, Maheshvara angered and emitted fire from his third eye of fire — the other two being sun and moon — burning away the body of the Sinful Demon (bdud sdig can, an epithet of the God of Desire), who thereby came to be called the "Bodiless Lord."

ma yin dgag|Illustration: mountainless plain (ri med pa'i thang)\nEnglish for Divisions?? (T) too many to fit (PH)Comment: The division of negatives, or negations, into affirming and non-affirming, or implicative and non-implicative, is traced to MimAMsA injunctions to refrain from activities that either imply another activity in its place or not. For example, a "mountainless plain" is an affirming negative that explicitly suggests or indicates a positive phenomenon (a plain) in place of its object of negation (mountains). Another type of affirming negative is one that by context suggests a positive phenomenon in place of its object of negation; for instance, being told that ShAkyamuni was either a brahmin or kSatriya (member of the royal or warrior class) and was not a brahmin suggests, by context, that he was of the royal caste. A positive phenomenon — being a kSatriya — is suggested in place of the object of negation — being a brahmin — in this context. See also "non-affirming negation" (med dgag).

med dgag|one of the two divisions of negation (dgag pa); the other is: affirming negative (ma yin dgag, paryudAsa-pratiSedha)Comment: The division of negatives, or negations, into affirming and non-affirming, or implicative and non-implicative, is traced to MimAMsA injunctions to refrain from activities that either imply another activity in its place or not. For example, the non-existence of the horns of a rabbit is expressed by the sentence, "The horns of a rabbit do not exist," and this does not suggest anything positive in place of the horns of a rabbit. Though it can suggest another non-affirming negative such as the non-existence of the beauty of the horns of a rabbit, it does not suggest any positive phenomenon in place of its object of negation. In the same way, an emptiness is a non-affirming negative such that the term expressing it does not suggest in place of the negation of its own object of negation another, positive phenomenon. See also "affirming negation" (ma yin dgag).

The three are called the three problematics (nyes pa, doza), often mistranslated as "humours," which are necessarily fluids whereas wind is not a fluid.
mkhris pa|bile; Comment: One of the three problematics (nyes pa; doza), often translated as "humours," but the "humours" are fluids as in the four elemental fluids of the body--blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. In Buddhist medicine the three problematics, which, when in balance, promote health and, when imbalanced, promote disease, are wind (rlung), bile (mkhris pa), and phlegm (pad kan).

Since thought and intention are posited in different ways with respect to one non-literal sUtra, [a sUtra having an] intention and [a sUtra having a] thought must be asserted as mutually inclusive. The basis in [Buddha's] thought is just what the Teacher has set in [his] mind and is not relative to another, the trainee, and purpose definitely must rely on another, the trainee, since it is for sake of taking care of another.

Embarassment (khrel yod pa) is an avoidance of faults from the viewpoint of another's disapproval and thus involves a concern for others' opinions, whereas ngo tsha (hrI) is an avoidance of faults from the viewpoint of one's own disapproval (i.e., self-image) or of religious prohibition.

ngo bo nyid med pa|niHsvabhAva; Comment: Another possible translation equivalent for "non-nature" (ngo bo nyid med pa; niHsvabhAva) is "non-entityness." Despite being admittedly awkward, it closely reflects in both its etymology and its meaning the Sanskrit term niHsvabhAva which is derived from the verbal root bhU "to be." For, "entity" is derived in its basic form (es) from the Latin esse "to be" and is derived in its suffixed form from the Sanskrit as which, like bhU, means "being." In addition, "entity" means "something that exists as a particular and discrete unit" or "the fact of existence; being." Thus, "non-entityness" would be a suitable translation for the negative term niHsvabhAva, if it were not so awkward; other possible translations are "non-thingness," "non-natureness," and "unreality." Since all of these choices are awkward and since trisvabhAva is translated as "three natures," I have chosen "non-nature" for niHsvabhAva; it has the additional virtue of reflecting the play between svabhAva and niHsvabhAva — (three) natures and (three) non-natures.

ngo bo dang khyad bar du kun btags pas stong pa'i stong pa nyid|emptiness of factors imputed in the manner of entity and attribute; Comment: This is one of two subtle emptinesses are set forth in Mind-Only literature. "The emptiness of factors imputed in the manner of entity and attribute" is described as an object's absence of being established by way of its own character as a referent of a term verbalizing it or of a conceptual consciousness apprehending it (rang zhes rjod pa'i sgra jug pa'i jug gzhir rang gi mtshan nyid kyis ma grub pa; rang 'dzin rtog pa'i zhen gzhir rang gi mtshan nyid kyis ma grub pa). These refer to, for instance, a table's not being established by way of its own mode of subsistence (rang gi gnas tshod kyi dbang gis ma grub pa) as the basis or referent (1) of the spoken terminology "table" and (2) of thoughts of table. Although a table is indeed the referent of the thought, "This is a table," or of the spoken word, "This is a table," it is not so established by way of its own character or by way of its own mode of subsistence. The absence of this status is called the "emptiness of a factor imputed in the manner of an entity." Similarly, although the table is indeed the referent of the thought, "This table is beautiful," or of the spoken word, "This table is beautiful," it is not so established by way of its own character or by way of its own mode of subsistence. The absence of this status is called the "the emptiness of a factor imputed in the manner of an attribute." Since factors imputed in the manner of entity and attribute do indeed exist, it is their being established by way of their own character that is refuted. The general term "empty of imputed factors" (kun btags kyis stong pa, parikalpitazUnya) without the qualification "in the manner of entity and attribute" can be used more widely to include the emptiness of any type of fictional imputation, including that of externality. See also "emptiness of external objects" (phyi rol don gyis stong pa).

phyi rol don du grub pas stong ba|definition of selflessness of phenomena (chos kyi bdag med)
phyi rol don gyis stong pa|emptiness of external objects; Comment: This is one of two different subtle emptinesses set forth in Mind-Only literature. The emptiness of external objects is also called the emptiness of apprehended-objects and apprehending-subjects existing as different substantial entities (bzung 'dzin rdzas tha dad kyis stong pa). This is explained as meaning that, for instance, a form such as a table appears to be a different substantial entity from the eye consciousness apprehending it but is not. A table appears to be distant and cut off (rgyang chad du snang ba) from the apprehending consciousness but is not; thus, a table is said to be empty of being a different entity from a valid consciousness, such as an eye consciousness, cognizing it; this is the emptiness of the table. Similarly, the eye consciousness apprehending the table is not a different entity from the table that it apprehends, and thus, from this point of view, the consciousness' absence of being a different entity from the table it perceives is the emptiness of the consciousness. Both the table and the consciousness exist, but both lack a certain quality — difference of entity — in relation to each other. See also "the emptiness of factors imputed in the manner of entity and attribute" (ngo bo dang khyad bar du kun btags pas stong pa'i stong pa nyid).

The first group of thirty-three is composed of conceptual consciousnesses that involve a strong movement of "wind" to their objects. They include conceptions such as fear, attachment, hunger, thirst, compassion, acquisitiveness, and jealousy. The second group of forty conceptions is composed of conceptual consciousnesses that involve a medium movement of "wind" to their objects — conceptions such as joy, amazement, generosity, desiring to kiss, heroism, non-gentleness, and crookedness. The third group of seven conceptions involve a weak movement of "wind" to their objects — forgetfulness, mistake as in apprehending water in a mirage, catatonia, depression, laziness, doubt, and equal desire and hatred. The three groups represent, on the ordinary level of consciousness, increasingly less dualistic perception; it is clear that in the third group the mind is strongly withdrawn.

rnam rig|Comment: The second chapter of AsaGga's Summary of the Great Vehicle, entitled "The Character of Objects of Knowledge," lists fifteen "cognitions," which are categories of phenomena. They are: 1. Cognitions of the body: the five sense powers, 2. Cognitions of the embodied: the afflicted mentality, 3. Cognitions of the enjoyer: the mind constituent, that is, the mental consciousness, 4. Cognitions of what is used by those: the six objects, 5. Cognitions of what uses those: the six consciousnesses, 6. Cognitions of time: the continuity of cyclic existence, 7. Cognitions of enumeration: numbering, 8. Cognitions of location: the world of the environment, 9. Cognitions of conventions: the four conventions — the seen (drSTa), the heard (zruta), the known (vijJAta), and the understood (mata), 10. & 11. Cognitions of the specifics of self and others: perceptions of self and other, 12. Cognitions of good transmigrations: humans and gods, 13. Cognitions of bad transmigrations: animals, hungry ghosts, and hell-beings, 14. Cognitions of death, 15. Cognitions of birth. The first nine arise from latent predispositions of verbalization (mngon brjod kyi bag chags) also called predispositions of verbal repetition (zlos pa'i bag chags). The tenth and the eleventh arise from latent predispositions of the view of self, also called predispositions of the view of the transitory collection ('jig tshogs la lta ba'i bag chags). The twelfth through the fifteenth arise from latent predispositions of the causal branches of existence, also called predispositions of maturation (rnam smin gyi bag chags).

However, other scholars more cogently take the term as referring to an object that is such that meditation upon it purifies obstructions. For instance, Jam-y#ang-shay-b#a, in speaking about the ultimate that is explicitly indicated at this point, qualifies the term "object of observation of purification" (rnam dag gi dmigs pa) with the phrase, "that which is such that, when it is observed and then is meditated upon, the obstructions to omniscience become purified" (gang la dmigs nas bsgom na shes sgrib dag par 'gyur ba).

ro tsa ba|Comment: in terms of the practice of Secret Mantra, the union of male and female is used with an entirely different consciousness. In this practice, the bliss arising from union of male and female is used to realize the emptiness of inherent existence in a totally non-dualistic and powerful way. For this practice to be effective, the regenerative fluid must be in good condition, and thus the importance of virilification is not limited to bringing physical pleasure or maintaining a family lineage but also includes enhancement of a high state of spiritual experience.

rtog pa|Comment: This is one of the four changeable mental factors (gzhan gyur bzhi, catvAri-anyathAbhAvA); for others see: gzhan gyur. In relation to analysis (dpyod pa), investigation (rtog pa) is considered to be a more coarse type of examination.\n In the GuhyasamAja system of Highest Yoga Tantra as presented in NAgArjuna's Five Stages (rim pa lnga pa, paJcakrama), conceptual consciousnesses are detailed as of eighty types, divided into three classes. The first group of thirty-three is composed of conceptual consciousnesses that involve a strong movement of "wind" to their objects. They include conceptions such as fear, attachment, hunger, thirst, compassion, acquisitiveness, and jealousy. The second group of forty conceptions is composed of conceptual consciousnesses that involve a medium movement of "wind" to their objects — conceptions such as joy, amazement, generosity, desiring to kiss, heroism, non-gentleness, and crookedness. The third group of seven conceptions involve a weak movement of "wind" to their objects — forgetfulness, mistake as in apprehending water in a mirage, catatonia, depression, laziness, doubt, and equal desire and hatred. The three groups represent, on the ordinary level of consciousness, increasingly less dualistic perception; it is clear that in the third group the mind is strongly withdrawn. They are called "indicative" because, for someone who has not experienced the three subtler levels of consciousness--mind of vivid white appearance, mind of vivid red or organge increase, and mind of black near-attainment (so called because it is near to manifesting the mind of clear light), these indicate what these consciousnesses are like.

sbyor ba la ldem por dgongs pa|Comment: dgongs pa (abhiprAyA) is often mistranslated as "intention." As Bel-den-chö-jay says:\n\n"Thought" (dgongs pa) is [posited] from the viewpoint of indicating the basis in [Buddha's] thought, "Thinking of this, [such and such] was said," and "intention" (ldem dgongs) is [posited] from the viewpoint of indicating purpose, "[Such and such] was said for this purpose." Since thought and intention are posited in different ways with respect to one non-literal sUtra, [a sUtra having an] intention and [a sUtra having a] thought must be asserted as mutually inclusive. The basis in [Buddha's] thought is just what the Teacher has set in [his] mind and is not relative to another, the trainee, and purpose definitely must rely on another, the trainee, since it is for sake of taking care of another. See Ann, dngos, 134.5.\n\nFour Intentions:\nIntending entry [into the teaching] (gzhug pa la ldem por dgongs pa, avatAranAbhisaMdhi)\nIntending the [three] characters (mtshan nyid la ldem por dgongs pa, lakSaNAbhisaMdhi)\nIntending an antidote (gnyen po la ldem por dgongs pa, pratipakSAbhisaMdhi)\nIntending translation (sbyor ba la ldem por dgongs pa/ bsgyur ba la ldem por dgongs pa, pariNAmAbhisaMdhi)\n\nFour Thoughts\nThinking of sameness (mnyam pa nyid la dgongs pa, samatAbhiprAya)\nThinking of another meaning (don gzhan la dgongs pa, arthAntarAbhiprAya)\nThinking of another time (dus gzhan la dgongs pa, kAlAntarAbhiprAya)\nThinking of a person's attitude (gang zag gi bsam pa la dgongs pa, pudgalAntarAbhiprAya)

Generally characterized phenomena (spyi mtshan) are solely permanent phenomena such as uncompounded space ('dus ma byas kyi nam mkha'). However, general characteristic, or general character, (spyi'i mtshan nyid) refers to a character of an object that is shared with other objects; for instance, impermanence is a general characteristic of consciousness (shes pa) and is also a general characteristic of form (gzugs). Similarly, specifically characterized phenomena (rang mtshan) are solely impermanent phenomena such as consciousness (shes pa) and form (gzugs), but the specific characteristic, or specific character, (rang gi mtshan nyid) of an object is its own definining character such as that which is luminous and knowing (gsal zhing rig pa), which is the definition of consciousness (shes pa), an impermanent phenomena; and the non-affirming negative which is a mere negation of obstructive contact (thogs reg bkag tsam gyi med dgag), which is the definition of uncompounded space, a permanent phenomena.

thabs|Comment: Gung-tang makes an important distinction between thabs (upAya) as compassion and thabs (upAya) as skillful means used to lead trainees by way of various techniques; he speaks from a tradition that distinguishes these two. It appears that in many Great Vehicle traditions, especially in East Asia, the two are conflated.

Substitutes such as "non-MahAyAna," "NikAya Buddhism," and "TheravAdayAna" have been suggested in order to avoid the pejorative sense of "Lesser." However, "Lesser Vehicle" is a convenient term in this particular context for a type of tenet system or practice that is seen in Tibetan scholarship to be surpassed but not negated by a "higher" system. The "Lesser Vehicle" is not despised, most of it being incorporated into the "Great Vehicle."

thub dbang|Comment: Buddhaguhya (sangs rgyas gsang ba) explains that the term muni (thub pa) means that the person has restrained body, speech, and mind (lus la sogs pa sdams pa ni thub pa zhes bya'o). Tibetan oral traditions also take thub pa as referring to one who has overcome the enemy that is the afflictive emotions. Many translators render muni as "sage," but I choose "subduer" because it conveys the sense of conquest that the term has in Tibetan, for thub pa means "able," with a sense of being able to overcome someone else. (ShAkya, the name of this Buddha's clan, also means "able" or "potent," this probably being the reason why the name ShAkyamuni was translated into Tibetan as zAkya thub pa, with the first part of the compound in transliterated Sanskrit and the second in Tibetan.) The term dbang po (indra) means "supreme one," "powerful one," "lord," and more loosely "king"; ShAkyamuni is depicted as the supreme among Subduers.
