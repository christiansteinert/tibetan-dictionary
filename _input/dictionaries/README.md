The subfolders contain the following data:

* public: input files with Tibetan as primary language (Tibetan-English, Tibetan-Sanskri and Tibetan-Tibetan files) 
* public_en: input files with English or Sanskrit as primary language (English-Tibetan and Sanskrit-Tibetan files)
* conversion: dictionaries in other data formats that first need to be converted in order to be importable and conversion scripts that were used to generate some of the files in the other two folders

The dictionary creation script will read from public/ and public_en/ and will build the database based on the data in these two folders
