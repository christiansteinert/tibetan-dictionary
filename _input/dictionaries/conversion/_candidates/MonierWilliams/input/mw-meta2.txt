mw-meta2.txt
Jun 18, 2018

This supercedes mw-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization mw.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is in two forms:
a) pseudo-xml coding in 'meta' lines
b) normal xml coding in the entries between the meta-lines.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meta lines: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines':

Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,

<L>3<pc>1,1<k1>a<k2>a<h>2<e>1
<hom>2.</hom> <s>a</s> ¦ (<s>pragfhya</s> <ab>q.v.</ab>), a vocative particle ([<s>a ananta</s>, O <s1 slp1="vizRu">Viṣṇu</s1>]), <ls>T.</ls>
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling in slp1 
  h The homonym number (usually a digit; letters are used for
    'synthetic' homonyms added by the Cologne digitization.)
  e Either a number 1-4, indicating one of the four 'lines' of words 
    described by Monier-Williams in the preface. The Cologne digitization
    typically breaks up entries for nominals into several pieces, and for
    these additional 'subentries', a letter (A,B,C or E) is appended to the
    number. The first subentry has only a number.
    Subsequent entries which have the same gender specification as the first
    entry are coded with A.  
    B indicates a different gender specification; for new feminine gender
    specifications, the headword will also be changed to the feminine form.
    C indicates an inflected form of the main entry; for instance  'agram'
    has a code of 1C; it is an accusative used as indeclineable.
    E indicates an 'etymology' section.  See for instance under headword
    'hari'
 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
XML tags within entries
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Numerous xml tags are introduced as markup within the body of entries.

<ab>X</ab>  general abbreviation. The expansion is from a separate table in
            the pywork/mwab directory.
<ab n="Y">X</ab> local abbreviation. Y is the expansion of X.
<ab n="Y" slp1="Z">X°</ab>  Abbreviation of a Sanskrit word. 
            Y is the IAST spelling and Z is the slp1 spelling
<s1 slp1="Z>Y</s1>  Y is given in the print as an IAST spelling of a 
            Sanskrit word; Z is the corresponding slp1 spelling. Y is
            typically normal (non-italic) text, usually a proper name.
<s>Z</s>    Sanskrit word in slp1 spelling; this is typically from
            italic IAST text in the print.
<shortlong/> Used within <s>Z</s> following a vowel which may be long or short
<srs/>      Used within <s>Z</s> following a long vowel which is a sandhi
            of two other vowels.  In the print, the vowel is represented
            with a circumflex diacritic.

<ns>Y</ns>  Y is a non-Sanskrit word presented in IAST spelling.
<i>x</i>    Italic text.  Only about 100 usages.
<etym>x</etym> markup of cognate words from other languages.
<lang n="greek">x</lang> Usually cognate word from Greek.
Words in Arabic script can be from several languages:
<lang script="Arabic" n="Arabic">x</lang>
<lang script="Arabic" n="Hindustani">x</lang>
<lang script="Arabic" n="Persian">x</lang>
<lang script="Arabic" n="Turkish">x</lang>

<bot>X</bot> X is a plant name, usually in the Linnaean hierarchy.
<bio>X</bio> X is an animal name, usually in the Linnaean hierarchy.
<ls>X</ls>   X is a literary source reference. In most cases, the reference
             can be linked to a separate table of 'Works and authors' (mwauth)
<pb n="p,c"/> A page break in the printed text; p is the page, c (1,2,3) is
             column.  The <pc> meta-field indicates the page and column at
             which the (sub)-entry begins in the printed edition.
<pcol>X</pcol> An internal reference to a different Page,Column.
<hom>X</hom>  A homonym number.  For an entry with a homonym number,
             the first sub-entry has the homonym in the <h> meta-tag.
             The text for this sub-entry will use the <hom> tag.  This
             <hom> tag also appears in cross-references. For examples:
               <L>1<pc>1,1<k1>a<k2>a<h>1<e>1
               <hom>1.</hom> <s>a</s> ¦ the first letter of the alphabet
               <LEND>
              ...See <hom>3.</hom> <s>a</s>  (under headword akupya)
<lex>G</lex> and <lex type="X>G</lex> tags enclose gender information for
            substantives and indeclineables.
            The <lex>G</lex> form is used for the primary gender information.
            The 'type' attribute makes some distinctions, not always clear,
            about non-primary gender specifications:
              hw : for a second gender specification
              hwalt : similar to hw
              hwifc : gender information when word is used at end of compound
              hwinfo : additional gender information
              nhw : gender information about some word different from the
                    headword of the entry
              part : gender information about a participle form, usually
                     appearing within the entry for a root.
              phw  : gender information about a headword mentioned 
                     parenthetically.

<div n="X"/>  used to indicate logical breaks; currently used mostly within
            entries for verbs. Significance of X:
            to : a new sense (e.g., to be lighted)
            vp : ('verb paragraph') before verb subsections for Passive,
                 Causal, etc.
            p :  ('paragraph') experimental, only 4 instances currently;
                 within entry for 'iti'
<info [various attributes]/>  Used to summarize certain inferences regarding
            entries.
    <info n="rev"/> or <info n="sup"/>  The entry is from the supplement;
            and is either a revision of an existing entry, or a new 
            supplementary word.  Although the printed edition has these
            entries in a separate section after the body of the dictionary,
            the Cologne digitization has merged these entries into the body.
    <info or="L1,X1;L2,X2"/> The headword for the entry has alternate spellings;
          one entry has cologne record ID L1 and headword X1, and the
          other is L2,X2.  This 'or' attribute appears in both entries.
    <info and="L1,X1;L2,X2"/>  similar to 'or'; but the text used the word 'and'
          to indicate the alternates.
    <info orsl="L1,X1;L2,X2"/> similar to 'or'; but the alternates arise
          due to a vowel which may be short or long.
    <info orwr="L1,X1;L2,X2"/> similar to 'or', but with a 'w.r.'
          (wrong reading)
<info phwchild="LC"/>, <info phwparent="LP,HWP"/>  An artifact of the Cologne
     digitization as a way to get additional headword entries which occur
     parenthetically within the printed text.  For headword X that occurs
     parenthetically within the entry having cologne id LP and citation HWP,
     the Cologne digitization manufactured an entry for X at record id LC;
     the <info phwchild="LC"/> appears within record LP, and the
     parent info appears within record LC; this ties the child X to its parent.
 
<info lex="Y"/>  Y provides summary gender information, in a standardized form.
    Y is a colon-separated list of gender specifications; e.g. 'm:f:n'. 
    Sometimes, the text provides additionaly stem information for a gender;
    for example that a feminine form ends in 'I'.  The standard form
    uses f#I for this example. So 'm:f#I' might be occur.
    For indeclineables, <info lex="ind"/>.
    For many sub-entries (e.g. those providing alternate senses), there is
    no explicit mention of gender information; in these cases, the assumption
    is that the gender information is 'inherited' from a previous sub-entry;
    this is coded as <info lex="inh"/>.

<info lexcat="Y"/>  This 'lexical category' attribute provides additional
    information for a small number of substantives; this information would
    be relevant when constructing inflected forms.
    The current forms of attribute value 'Y':
    LEXID=pron,STEM=X   pronoun. e.g., X=asmad occurs under headwords:
         asma, asmat, asmad, aham, Ava, nO, ma (hom 3), mat, mad, man, vayam
    LEXID=card,STEM=X   cardinal numbers; e.g. X=Sata, daSan
    LEXID=prap,STEM=X,ROOTCLASS=Y  present active participle.
               e.g., X=Barat, Y=Bf-1  (1st homonym of Bf)
    LEXID=fap,STEM=X,ROOTCLASS=Y  future active participle
               e.g.  X=Akzyat, Y=akz
    loan  : loan words from other languages; only three instances under
            headwords sAheb-rAm, sArisTA-KA, humAuM
    INFLECTID=X,STEM=Y A few entries have an inflected form as headword,
            instead of the usual stem form. 
            X indicates the gender-case-number of the headword; 
              Example: f1d = feminine nominative dual 
                       (aSanAyA—pipAse = hunder and thirst)
            Y = the stem from which headword is inflected; e.g. aSanAyApipAsA

<info verb="X" .../> Summarize several details regarding verb entries.
    The are several forms of X and of the additional attributes.
    X = genuineroot, cp="Y" . The text identifies about 750 roots as 'genuine';
       these appear in large Devanagari in the print.
       'cp' = class-pada summary derived from the entry, a comma-separated list 
              Examples: (empty), 0P (no class, parasmaipada),
                        0Ā,0P  , (no class, both parasmaipada and atmanepada)
                        1,10P  (class 1 no pada, class 10 parasmaipada)
    X = root, cp="Y"  The non-genuine roots.
    X = pre,  cp="Y", parse="P+R".  Prefixed roots.  parse separates out
        the underlying prefix and root forms in a sandhi-analyzed form.
        Examples: Akamp = A+kamp,  ude = ud+A+i
    X = gati, cp="Y", parse="P+R".  roots with an affix formed from 
        prefixes other than the standard upasargas.
        Example: urarIkf = urarI+kf
        Note:  These need to be examined and corrected.
    X = nom, cp="Y"  Denominative verbs (verbs formed from nouns). Text 
        identifies these with the abbreviation 'Nom.'.

<info westergaard="X,Y,Z"/> Monier-Williams provides many links to
     the Westergaard Dhatupatha.  The attribute value contains
     X =  the Westergaard DP spelling of root in slp1.
     Y =  Westergaard section.item reference
     Z =  Reference in Sāyaṇa's Mādhavīya Dhātuvṛtti.
     Example: headword BAz (भाष्), BAza,16.11,01.0396
<info whitneyroots="R,p"/> A reference to the root in W.D. Whitney's
     "The Roots, Verb-forms and Primary Derivatives of the Sanskrit Language".
     'R' is the root spelling in slp1(possibly with homonym suffix),
     'p' is the page number.
     Example: headword BAZ, BAz,110.
  These links are subject to correction.
  Heavy use was made of the digitizations of Sāyaṇa's Mādhavīya Dhātuvṛtti and
  Whitney's Roots prepared under the direction of Peter Scharf; these 
  digitizations are available at //sanskritlibrary.org/referenceWorks.html.


Words using diacritics with the Latin alphabet are represented in Unicode 
characters.  
For Sanskrit words, the spelling of such words aims to be modern IAST unicode,
generally as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration
The usage of diacritics in the printed text has many differences from
the modern IAST appearing in this version of the digitization.
We have intentionally retained a couple of the peculiarities of the printed IAST.

There are about 200 different non-ascii Unicode characters used in the
digitization.  The following provides some contextual guidance as to where
these characters occur.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Punctuation and special purpose

¦  (\u00a6) 287433 := BROKEN BAR  (Demarcates the headword part of an entry)

¯  (\u00af)    53 := MACRON  Long in metric pattern
˘  (\u02d8)    48 := BREVE   Short in metric pattern

°  (\u00b0) 53813 := DEGREE SIGN  continuation sign in abbreviation

—  (\u2014) 257560 := EM DASH  separate parts of a Sanskrit compound; also '-' 
‘  (\u2018) 20692 := LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK  
’  (\u2019) 20692 := RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
√  (\u221a) 15532 := SQUARE ROOT  indicates following word is a Sanskrit root
