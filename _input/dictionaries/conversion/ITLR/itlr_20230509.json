In its Tibetan rendering “ye shes,” which reflects the latter sense, it also has the meaning of “primordially existing knowledge,” which is expressed in the syllable “ye.” However, it appears that this meaning of the syllable “ye” in the word “ye shes” is secondary and that its original meaning is something like “total” or “complete,” denoting the notion that the knowledge of the Noble Ones is “complete.” \\n",

        "The legend surrounding the figure of Dīpaṃkara originated in the centuries immediately preceding the turn of the Common Era. Dīpaṃkara developed into a pan-Buddhist figure and a fundamental point of reference for narratives dedicated to the description of past buddhas. He plays, in particular, a fundamental role in the lineages of buddhas under which the future Śākyamuni progressed towards Awakening. The oldest datable text featuring a buddha lineage stemming from Dīpaṃkara is the old Bahubuddhakasūtra tradition. This is transmitted in three versions: (1) a Gāndhārī version, transmitted in an unpublished 1st century BCE/1st century CE Kharoṣṭhī manuscript preserved in the Library of Congress; (2) a version in Buddhist Prakrit-cum-Sanskrit, transmitted in Mahāvastu III.241–250; (3) a Chinese version, preserved in the Fo benxing ji jing (T 190, vol. III, 663b12–664a11, 668c25–672a11). Version (1) preserves a lineage of 15 buddhas, from Dīpaṃkara to Maitreya; Versions (2–3) transmit instead a lineage of 17 buddhas. Closely related versions of this lineage are also found in the Mahākaruṇāpuṇḍarīka (T 380, vol. XII, 962a29–c17; D 111, mDo sde, vol. Cha, 102a7–103a3) and the Mahāśītavana (D 562, rGyud, vol. Pha, 138b7–139a6). In later Pāli literature, Dīpaṃkara commonly features as the primary figure in a lineage of 24 predecessors. See, for instance, Buddhavaṃsa 9–23; Jātaka-aṭṭhakathā 2–30. ",
        "The story of the encounter between the past Buddha and the future Śākyamuni, then the brahmin Megha (also Sumati, P. Sumedha), is the locus classicus where the notions of adhikāra, praṇidhāna and vyākaraṇa, as the key acts involved in a buddha–bodhisattva encounter, converge. The Bodhisattva is often said to have honored the past Buddha by throwing lotus flowers at him and/or by spreading his hair on a muddy path for the Buddha to walk upon. For an example in Buddhist Sanskrit, see the Dīpaṃkaravastu of the Mahāvastu (I.191–248). ",
        "The name Dīpaṃkara is variously explained in the Mahāvastu: (1) his body wonderfully emits light; (2) he was born on an island. The latter explanation caused the emergence of the variant name Dvīpaṃkara, due to the secondary Sanskritization of the Middle Indo-Aryan form dīpa, meaning both lamp and island. For the relevant passage below, in “Occurrences in Primary Sources”.",
        "Several Mahāyāna scriptures reinterpret the key moment in the encounter between the future Śākyamuni and Dīpaṃkara, namely the vyākaraṇa imparted by the Buddha to his distant successor, in relation to the acquisition of the “conviction with respect to the non-arising of entities” (anutpattikadharmakṣānti), which marks the status of the Bodhisattva as avaivartika. In the Gaṅgadevībhaginīparivarta of the Aṣṭasāhasrikā and the *Buddhapiṭaka-Duḥśīlanigrahī (T 653; D 220), the Bodhisattva realises the anutpattikadharmakṣānti before receiving the vyākaraṇa, see Aṣṭasāhasrikā 747.19–24; T. 653, vol. XV, 797c29–798a4; D 220, mDo sde, vol. Dza, 57a3–4. In the Dīpaṃkaravyākaraṇa (D 188), the anutpattikadharmakṣānti is realised after the vyākaraṇa. For the Tibetan text and English translation, see Matsumura 2011: 79–80. Similarly, the Dharmapada of the Dharmaguptakas, as cited in Bhāviveka’s Tarkajvālā, alludes to the fact that Śākyamuni attained the eighth bhūmi and the 10 vaśitās when he received the vyākaraṇa from Dīpaṃkara. Tibetan text in Eckel 2008: 354.4–13.\\n"

Sanderson argues that this was done by the third king of the dynasty, namely Devapāla (r. circa 812–850). The monastery was deserted and destroyed around CE 1200.  ",

It is generally regarded as one of the greatest strongholds of Tantric Buddhism.",

        "It should be noted that in the Kathmandu Valley there is yet another ancient monastery that is known by the name Vikramaśīlamahāvihāra, among others. Although it seems that there is a historical relationship between the Indian institution and its Nepalese counterpart, they should not be confused. ",

        "According to Tibetan sources, Ratnākaraśānti was one of those scholars known as the “six gate[-keeping] paṇḍitas” (mkhas pa sgo drug) of the Vikramaśīla monastic seminary, and “the keeper of the eastern gate” (shar sgo srung ba po).",
        "“Ratnākaraśānti, an Eastern Indian, was active at the famous monastic center of learning Vikramaśīla in the first half of the 11th century. He appears to have been one of the most learned, prolific, and admired Buddhist authors of his time. A wide range of works on tantric as well as non-tantric Buddhism are attributed to him, and he also authored a handbook of Sanskrit metre, the Chandoratnākara, and a book of ingenious riddles, the Vidagdhavismāpana. Almost certainly, however, some of the works attributed to Ratnākaraśānti are not by the celebrated author of that name. In some cases it appears that a work has been deliberately given this attribution, presumably with the aim of increasing its status or readership (Isaacson, 2010, 267). Several commentaries on tantric texts do survive in Sanskrit, however, that seem to be genuinely by one man, the famous Ratnākaraśānti.”",
        "“In his Madhyamakālaṃkāravṛtti-Madhyamapratipadāsiddhi and Madhyam(ak)ālaṃkāropadeśa Ratnākaraśānti firmly rejects the idea that all is false, stating that it is incompatible with Nāgārjuna’s as well as Maitreyanātha’s and Asaṅga’s teachings. But in both these compositions, which are contained in the Cittamātra (Sems·ćam) section of the bsTan· ’gyur, none of the main lines of development of the Madhyamaka discussed above prevails; and Ratnākaraśānti’s doctrine is in essence a Nirākāra-Vijñānavāda teaching with the Middle Way presented following the system of the three svabhāvas (the parikalpita˚, the paratantra˚ and the pariniṣpanna˚) of the Madhyāntavibhāga for example.” ",
        "“To begin with, Jñānaśrīmitra seems to have been a younger contemporary of Ratnākaraśānti, since he cites passages from the latter’s Prajñāpāramitopadeśa in his Sākārasiddhiśāśtra. Both are enumerated among the teachers of Atīśa.”"

In the early Buddhist scheme of four levels of awakening, which are defined by the stage by stage eradication of a set of ten fetters (saṃyojana) that binds unawakened worldlings to saṃsāra, a non-returner has eradicated the first five of such fetters: (1) the fetter of personality view; (2) the fetter of doubt; (3) the fetter of dogmatic clinging to rules and vows; (4) the fetter of sensual lust; and (5) the fetter of ill-will. In other words, a non-returner is beyond sensual attraction of any type and also will no longer react to anything with anger or aversion. The task that still lies ahead for the non-returner is the eradication of the remaining five fetters of (6) craving for fine-material states; (7) craving for immaterial states; (8) conceit; (9) restlessness; and (10) ignorance. Thus defined, a non-returner is still subject to more subtle types of attachment and has not yet completely eradicated ignorance."

        "Maitreya (Pāli: Metteyya) is also later called Ajita. Metteyya is mentioned only once in the early layers of the Pāli canon (Cakkavattisutta, PTS, vol. 3, pp. 75–76). According to some later Pāli sources (Mahāvaṃsa 32.72–75), Metteyya is one of the ten future Buddhas. In the non/pre-Tantric Mahāyāna sources such as the Bhadrakalpikasūtra (Weller 1928: 3; SWTF; Dhīḥ: vol. 25, p. 29; Nobel 1950: s.v. byams pa), Maitreya is regarded as the next and fifth Buddha (i.e. out of 1004 or 1005 Buddhas) of the fortunate aeon. Of the many future Buddhas, Maitreya is without doubt by far the most prominent one. His cult extended over virtually all regions in which Buddhism flourished. In both Tantric and non-Tantric Mahāyāna sources, Maitreya often belongs to a set of eight bodhisattva-s as in the Niṣpannayogāvalī and Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa. This set of eight is called “eight great close sons” (nye ba’i sras chen brgyad) in the Tibetan tradition (Tshig mdzod chen mo: s.v. rje btsun byams pa). Occasionally, he is also regarded as belonging to a set of ten bodhisattva-s (e.g. in the Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa); and of sixteen bodhisattva-s (e.g. in the Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa). Maitreya also occurs as a Buddhist Tantric deity in a number maṇḍala-s such as the 53-deity Vajradhātumaṇḍala (Mori 2001:  267), 43-deity Mañjuvajramaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 265), and 37-deity Durgatipariśodhanamaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 254). According to the Gūḍhapadā, Maitreya has to be visualized together with the fifteen other bodhisattva-s on the first of the four bands (paṭṭikā) of the bodhicittavajramaṇḍala (cf. occurrences below). In the Guhyasamājatantra (including the Samājottara) he is listed as the first of the eight mahābodhisattva-s. In chapter 17 of this tantra he is one of the interlocutors with all the Tathāgata-s (sarvatathāgata), who explain to him how the vajrācārya “should be seen”, i.e. conceived, by Buddha-s and bodhisattva-s (cf. prose passage after st. 51, ed. Matsunaga pp. 104–105). In the abhiṣeka section of his Ācāryakriyāsamuccaya, Darpaṇācārya (a.k.a. Jagaddarpaṇa) lists Maitreya as one of the nine bodhisattva-s that constitute the saṅghamaṇḍala, the third of the three maṇḍala-s (the other two being the buddhamaṇḍala and the dharmamaṇḍala) that have to be made by the practitioner after making offerings at the beginning of the ritual (see occurrences below). A very brief description of Maitreya can be found in the Vajrāmṛtamahātantrarājaṭīkā by Śrībhānu, where, in the commentary on Vajrāmṛtatantra 6.9, Maitreya is listed as the first of eight bodhisattva-s: he is yellow/golden-coloured, and with his hands makes the varadamudrā and bears a garland of flowers (D 1651, vol. Ra, fol. 87b3–4). A slightly more detailed description of Maitreya is given in the Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa (ed. Vaidya, p. 43). Here is the only bodhisattva who is close to the Bhagavān, whereas the other seven (here too called mahābodhisattva-s) are located on his right side. Among other things, Maitreya is said to be wearing the dress of a brahmacārin, twisted hair, and a crown; he is gold-coloured, his (lower and upper) garment is red, he has three lines on the forehead; in his left hand he bears a jar with a handle; in his right hand he bears a rosary. A mantra of Maitreya (oṃ maitrīyaharaṇāya [read: maitreyaspharaṇāya?] svāhā) and a mudrā connected with him (i.e. his visualization) are given in the Sarvadurgatipariśodhanatantra (see Skorupski, 1983, transl. pp. 9, 23; text pp. 129, 154). In this tantra, Maitreya is the first of a list of 16 bodhisattva-s (the list overlaps only in part with the one that we find for instance in Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa, p. 28). As is to be expected, Maitreya is praised as the eighth in hymns dedicated to the seven Buddhas: Vipaśyin, Śikhin, etc. (cf. Saptajinastava, st. 8, and Saptabuddhastotra, stt. 8–9; see Pandeya 1994: 248, 250).",
        "According to the traditional view, the high-ranking bodhisattva and next Buddha, Maitreya, is the author of several seminal works, in particular Yogācāra treatises. Only in modern scholarly literature is it sometimes supposed that there was a historical Yogācāra author bearing the name Maitreya(nātha), who later was confused with his celestial namesake. Both the Tibetan and the Chinese tradition commonly ascribe a pentad of texts to Maitreya. However, except for the (Mahāyāna)sūtrālaṃkāra and the Madhyāntavibhāga, different texts are listed (BBK3: 318; Sakuma 2013: 334)."

The Buddha, however, admonished her not to demonstrate her magical prowess in the presence of a buddha (pp. 192–193).  Utpalavarṇā was killed by Devadatta. Because he  was not granted access to the palace of Ajātaśatru, Devadatta became furious. He hit Utpalavarṇā on the head who was just coming out of the palace.

In BHS this is the only certain mg. of the word: Mvy 1358; 1980; 5237 = Tib. ḥgyod pa, regret, remorse, in 5237 = vipratisāra; similarly Chin.; Prāt 504.9 bhikṣūṇāṃ kaukṛtyāya vilekhāya …; 518.3 bhikṣoḥ saṃcintya kaukṛtyam upasaṃharet, shall consciously cause disturbance of conscience (but see below) to a monk; Mvy 8487 kaukṛtyopasaṃhāraḥ, the causing of disturbance of conscience; KP 3.6 (vs) pareṣu kaukṛty’ (= °tyam) upasaṃharanti; SP 285.9, 11 kaukṛtyam upasaṃharati; 287.2 kaukṛtyasthānaṃ (here Tib. the tshom gnas, position of doubt, but better occasion for mental disturbance in another) ca na jātu kuryān, na lapsyase jñānam anuttara(ṃ) tvam; Mv iii.48.14 °tyam utpādetsuḥ; 173.9 cauro ahan ti tasya kaukṛtyam utpannaṃ; 173.19 mā kaukṛtyaṃ janehīti; Kv 80.5 (mā tvaṃ ...) kaukṛtyam utpādayasi; Śikṣ 138.1 lajjābhiḥ kaukṛtyasaṃpannaiḥ paralokāvadyabhayadarśibhir; LV 32.19 anupanāho ... akaukṛtyāya saṃvartate, … leads to freedom from remorse; SP 71.4 bhikṣūṇāṃ kaukṛtyavinodanārthaṃ, yathā … niṣkāṅkṣā nirvicikitsā bhaveyuḥ (see below); Śikṣ 135.16 tena niṣkaukṛtyena bhūtvā nirvicikitsakena …; Bbh 83.14 kaukṛtyaprativinodana-paricaryā; 137.24 niṣkaukṛtyo bhavati; 250.20 sva-kaukṛtye samutpanne … yā lajjā; one of a list of upakleśa, Dharmas 69, and elsewhere associated with such things as vyāpāda, styāna-middha, auddhatya, vicikitsā, Bbh 173.1; auddhatya-kau°, one of the 5 nīvaraṇa, q.v.; paryavasthāna (q.v.) or possession by, fixation in, these ’depravities’ leads to misery and must be avoided, Bbh 145.10 f.; 223.14; 243.22; kaukṛtya-paryutthānam (= paryavasthānam) Śikṣ 178.14; similarly, dṛṣṭi-kaukṛtya-pratiṣṭhitasya KP 96.4, where Tib. renders as usual by ḥgyod, regret, remorse, which tends against interpretation of the word in this connection (as an upakleśa) etymologically, as state of wickedness; Śikṣ 191.7 a-kaukṛtya-tā, immediately followed by a-paryutthāna-tā (cf. Śikṣ 178.14 above); Śikṣ 171.4 āpatti-kaukṛtya-sthānaṃ viśodhayituṃ, perhaps to wipe away any occasion for remorse due to sin (but Bendall and Rouse state of sin and wickedness, taking kaukṛtya etymologically; the Tib. is not cited); Laṅk 139.(13-)14,15 (yasya kasyacid anyasyānantaryakāriṇaḥ) kaukṛtyaṃ, tasya kaukṛtyadṛṣṭivinivartanārthaṃ nikṣiptadhurasya kaukṛtyadṛṣṭyabhāvārtham (Suzuki wickedness; but remorse, troubles of mind or conscience would seem preferable); Sādh 17.11 kaukṛtyam ājīvamalaṃ ratiṃ saṃgaṇikāsu ca (here wickedness seems more likely than in any other passage, but even here the word may mean only something like mental perturbation; note association with vicikitsā, kāṅkṣā, above; Chinese translations sometimes are said to render kau° by doubt, e. g. acc. to Finot on Prāt 518.3; so perhaps understand SP 71.4, above).”",

But if we consider the explanation of the name found, for example, in MW (see above)—“Oh, do not (practice austerities)!”—it becomes clear that Tibetan translators presupposed such a para-etymology. The name dKa’ bzlog ma may thus be understood as “One who was barred/prevented from the practice of austerities (dka’ thub: tapas) [by her mother].” Johannes Schneider (Schneider 1993: 308, 89) was unsure of the Sanskrit behind the Tibetan dKa’ bzlog ma, even though he cites an explanation of the name found in the Devātiśayastotraṭīkā (Schneider 1993: 89, n. 4): dka’ bzlog ni dka’ thub bzlog pa ste | lha mo u ma’o ||. Schneider suggests (with a question mark) that dKa’ bzlog ma could be a rendering of Durgā. The Tibetan translation of the name Umā is actually recorded in the Mahāvyutpatti but Schneider does not refer to it. The name Durgā has been translated into Tibetan as dGrod dka’ ma and Durgādevī as rDzong gi lha mo."

These mudrā-s or gestures may have their origin in mnemonic techniques employed by reciters of the Veda, and so readily serve as a means of evoking an idea in the mind as well as symbolizing various things, such as certain powers or deities. The term mudrā, like vidyā (rig ma), is also used with reference to the female partner of a deity or a practitioner.”",

        "According to Yaśomitra’s explanation of Vasubandhu’s mention of Patañjali’s expression, devānāmpriya can be understood in two ways: for some, he is a “man of straight character” (“homme de nature droite”, ṛjukajātīya), for such a man is loved by the gods. For others, he is a stupid person, for a man favoured by kings (deva being glossed by īśvara) does not undergo a strict training. La Vallée Poussin mentions other passages cited by the Japanese editor of the Kośa in which the understanding “stupid person” (“sot”) is adopted for devānāmpriya, but also gives two other explanations, namely, (i) the term designates somebody who is rich, but is applied ironically to poor people; (ii) the term should be interpreted as a karmadhāraya, and deva as a stupid person; the compound thus designates someone who loves stupid persons, i.e., is himself stupid. According to La Vallée Poussin, in Patañjali’s time it was a royal title that tended to be used ironically, as in Patañjali’s dialogue between the coachman and the grammarian.",
        "Considered by Kātyāyana to constitute an exception to Pāṇini’s rule (vi.3.ii) according to which a compound whose first term is in the genitive is unacceptable. Title of Indian kings at the time of the Mauryas. Since Patañjali, found only in controversies where one of the debaters addresses his opponent in the third person and in the works of grammarians that explain Patañjali. Kayata, followed by the Siddhāntakaumudī (vi.3.11), explains deva as mūrkha (idiot), and hence devānāmpriya as “idiot” (the idiots are the ones loved by the idiots)."

        "Hayagrīva, who is regarded as manifestation of Avalokiteśvara therefore belonging to the Lotus family, is one of the wrathful deities (krodha) in the 19-deity maṇḍala of the Jñānapāda school (Tanaka 1997) as well as in the 32-deity maṇḍala of the Ārya school  (Luo & Tomabechi 2009: pp. xxxii–xxxiii) of the Guhyasamāja tradition. He also appears as one of the 43-deity Mañjuvajramaṇḍala (Mori 2001: p. 264) and in the 66-deity Ṣaṭcakravartimaṇḍala described in the Vajrāvalī (Mori 2001: p. 246). Hayagrīva’s location in the maṇḍala and position with regard to other krodharāja-s vary according to the context and the Tantric system. Usually he has to be visualized in his wrathful appearance, sometimes in connection with Bhṛkuṭī (especially in the sādhana-s of Khasarpaṇa and Padmanarteśvara, two forms of Avalokiteśvara), other times in connection with Yamāntaka, Aparājita and Amṛtakuṇḍali (see occurrences below). While Hayagrīva makes part of the pantheon of the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha (where in chapters 16, 18b we also find mantra-s connected with him), of the Guhyasamājatantra and of the Kṛṣṇayamāritantra, he is totally absent in other influential Tantric sources such as the Hevajratantra (see occurrences below). According to some sources, Hayagrīva has to be visualized by the practitioner on his mouth (see occurrences below). Hayagrīva is mentioned and occasionally described in seven of the sādhana-s published in the Sādhanamālā collection (Sādhanamālā: nos. 13–15, 18, 24, 26, 32).",

        "“The Vikramaśīla monastery was the central monastery of Tantric Buddhism in India during this period, and it seems certain that Abhaya’s work reflects the routine style of the rituals of his time. Furthermore, Abhaya himself has been highly esteemed as the most distinguished Buddhist scholar of the final period of Indian Buddhism, which vanished from that country approximately one century after his death. Indian Tantric Buddhism was thus rapidly approaching its culmination during the period of Abhaya’s lifetime … Tāranātha provides some information about Abhaya in his Chos ’byung. According to this source, King Rāmapāla just after his enthronement invited Abhaya to become abbot of the Buddhagayā monastery. Then the King appointed him as abbot of the Vikramaśīla and Nālandā monasteries. In Tāranātha’s opinion, Abhaya was the last distinguished scholar in the history of Indian Buddhism. He suggests that Abhaya’s works should be esteemed more highly than the works of all other masters (ācārya) belonging to the period subsequent to the Six Jewels of the Vikramaśīla monastery who flourished in the first half of the 11th century. The Six Jewels of the Vikramaśīla monastery are Ratnākaraśānti, Prajñākaramati, Vāgīśvarakīrti, Nāropa, Ratnavajra, Jñānaśrīmitra. The names of some direct disciples of Abhaya are mentioned by Tāranātha: Śubhakarasena, Raviśrījñāna, Nāyakaśrī, Daśabalaśrī, Dharmākaraśānti, Viyaśodeva, Niṣkalaṅkadeva, Dharmākaragupta and others. Śākyaśrībhadra, the great paṇḍita from Kashmir, is listed in the next generation. According to Tāranātha, Abhaya passed away a few years before King Rāmapāla’s abdication, which took place ca. 1125. Thus we can place the approximate date of Abhaya in the final decades of the 11th century and the first quarter of the 12th century.” ",
        "“An encyclopedic author active during the reign of Rāmapāla (ca. 1084–1126 / 1077–ca. 1119) of the Pāla Dynasty, Abhayākaragupta is renowned for his erudition that covers a vast range of subjects in Buddhism.  His expertise is especially prominent in, though not limited to, the area of Tantric Buddhism, as attested by the well-known “Garland Trilogy” (phreng ba skor gsum), i.e. his three major works on Tantric ritual (Vajrāvalī, Jyotirmañjarī and Niṣpannayogāvalī), that exercised a great influence on the Buddhism of later period in Nepal and Tibet. \\nThe Peking Tanjur includes twenty-six works ascribed to Abhayākaragupta, of which twenty-three are in the domain of Tantra; the other three deal with non-Tantric Buddhism.  Though most of these works are only available through Tibetan translation, some important texts of Abhayākaragupta are preserved in Sanskrit. The following works in Sanskrit have hitherto been edited: Niṣpannayogāvalī; Vajrāvalī; Jyotirmañjarī; Ucchuṣmajambhalasādhana; Svādhiṣṭhānakramopadeśa.  In addition, Sanskrit manuscripts are known to exist of the Pañcakramatātparyapañjikā Kramakaumudī, Kālacakrāvatāra, Abhayapaddhati.  According to some recent information, furthermore, Sanskrit manuscripts of the Āmnāyamañjarī, Munimatālaṅkāra and Madhyamakamañjarī  have been discovered in Tibet.” ",
        "“Abhayākaragupta was among the last great masters of Buddhism in India. Active at the famous monastery of Vikramaśīla during the reign of Rāma Pāla (c. 1100), he wrote prolifically on most major areas of Buddhist practice and thought: Mahāyāna doctrine and the path, and Tantric ritual and meditation are all encyclopedically represented in the writings that survive. Through both his impact on Tibetan visitors to Vikramaśīla, and the continuing activity of his successors in connection with the transmission of Indian traditions to Tibet, he came also to exert a remarkable influence upon the formation of Tibetan Buddhism, particularly during the twelfth through fourteenth centuries. Nevertheless, because his works have received little attention in contemporary scholarship, his importance as an exemplar of Buddhism under the Pāla dynasty as well as his legacy in Tibet have remained largely unknown.” ",
        "“Abhayākaragupta (late eleventh to early twelfth century), a contemporary of king Rāmapāla, is the last great scholar in the last phase of the history of Indian Buddhism. Twenty four works belonging to different sections of bsTan ’gyur are attributed to him. The Abhayapaddhati (henceforth AP), an extensive commentary on the Buddhakapālatantra, is one of the two commentaries on esoteric scriptural texts written by him, the other one being the Āmnāyamañjarī, an encyclopedic commentary on the Saṃpuṭatantra. Most likely, AP was written during the period of 1096–1108, when Abhayākaragupta also began to compose the Vajrāvalī.” ",
        "“Abhayākaragupta flourished about 1100 and was a scholar of the Vikramaśīlā (sic) monastic seminary. There, in the thirtieth year of the reign of King Rāmapāla (rg. c. 1077–1130 or 1072–1126), he composed the Munimatālaṃkāra. This very extensive treatise of encyclopaedic character expounds Mahāyānist gnoseology and soteriology in connexion with the Prajñāpāramitā doctrine and includes many references to the basic texts of both the Madhyamaka and Yogācāra/Vijñānavāda schools.” ",

The works and their dates are\\n1. the Abhayapaddhati, composed during the twenty-fifth year,\\n2. the Munimatālaṃkāra, composed during the thirtieth year,\\n3. and the Āmnāyamañjarī, completed during the thirty-seventh year.”"

        "The two terms svalakṣaṇa (particular) and sāmānyalakṣaṇa (universal) play a central role in the Buddhist logico-epistemological school initiated by Dignāga.  They are closely tied to both the epistemological and ontological theories that define this school.  Ontologically, the particular is what is real, with reality defined as being capable of producing an effect.  This implies, at least since Dharmakīrti, that any particular must be momentary.  Its momentariness, furthermore, implies that it is spatially and temporally unique.  This commits this group of Buddhists to the position that the common objects of everyday experience are just a continuum (santāna) of moments in a causal nexus with each other.  \\n\\nThe universal is defined as what is other than a particular, and, hence, what does not exist in reality as defined above.  A universal is whatever is experienced (by unawakened beings) as persisting throughout time.  This category includes all the objects of normal experience, as well as anything that causes a cognition of things as the same (a central point of contention in the philosophical debate with the realist schools of India). \\n\\nEpistemologically, the particular and the universal are aligned with the two sources of knowledge accepted by these Buddhists: perception takes a particular as its object, and inference a universal."

According to Dharmakīrti, however, the fallacy of viruddhāvyabhicārin “could arise when one of the disputants relied on an inference which was simply based on his scriptures (āgamāśritānumāna),” but not in the case of an inference caused by the force of [real] entities (vastubalapravṛttānumāna), and hence it should not be enumerated as a kind of fallacious logical reason."

Descriptions in primary sources—though there are few—show a considerable amount of diversity as regards the actual ritual procedure, and accentuate the need for authorisation. The saṃpuṭoghāṭa is listed among the  Esoteric Ten Fundamentals (*guhyadaśatattva) to be mastered by a Tantric officiant of the Higher Tantras (see, for instance, the respective list in the Vajrahṛdayālaṃkāratantra). In the daśatattva lists given by Vimalakīrti and Ḍombī, applying the divergent technical terminology of the Ḍakinīvajrapañjaratantra, the corresponding ritual is referred to as *bheda (Tib. dgar).

Second, Vajraḍākinī is a name borne by several female deities in specific maṇḍala-s such as Sampuṭatantroktavajrasattvamaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 297), Jñānaḍākinīmaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 295), Hevajramaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 294), Nairātmyāmaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 292), Kurukullāmaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 281, 289), and Mahāmāyāmaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 285). Third, in the  Cakrasaṃvara context, Vajraḍākinī is often an appellation of Vajrayoginī/Vajravārāhī, the principal female deity of the system, in particular."

        "In Buddhist Tantrism, the term jñānāmṛta has different values: first of all, it occurs as one of the two subcategories of sevā (besides vajracatuṣka, see also s.v. sevā and s.v. vajracatuṣka) as distinguished in Guhyasamājatantra xviii. In this context, it is an alternative term for ṣaḍaṅgayoga (see respective quotation below). In descriptions of the insight-gnosis initiation, the semen (bodhicitta) is said to be imagined as gnosis nectar. Moreover, in a less specific sense, it is occasionally applied to the five nectars (pañcāmṛta). It can also refer to a nectar that is visualized as drawn from the hearts of the Buddhas in all directions, embodying the five Buddha gnoses, which is mixed with the five nectars and made homogenous with them."

According to dGe ’dun chos ’phel, it is the place where the Buddha set the Wheel of Dharma into motion for the first time, one of the “four great sacred places [connected with the life] of the Buddha” (sangs rgyas kyi gnas chen po bzhi), or, one of the “eight great sacred places [connected with the life of the Buddha]” (gnas chen brgyad).",

This is at present situated at the confluence of the rivers Vāraṇā and Asi, but formerly  at the confluence of the Ganges and Gomati (gaṅgāyā uttare kule vaprānte rājasattama | gomatyā dakṣiṇe kule śakrasyevāmarāvatīm || Mb. 13.30.18). It was the capital of Kāśī, and seat of a Brahmanical University.”",
        "With regard to the Tibetan interpretation of the name Vārāṇasī, Michael Hahn states: “A noteworthy case is khor mo(r) ’jig and wā rā ṇa sī for Vārāṇasī, which in the first case was analyzed as consisting of vāra “turn” and the derivation of the root naś “to perish.” In connection with this explanation of the Tibetan translation of Vārāṇasī, it should be perhaps made clear that ’khor/khor mor was obviously understood adverbially, that is, in the sense of vāraṃ vāram or vāraṃ vāreṇa, “many times, often, repeatedly” (MW, s.v. vāra). Thus ’khor mor ’jig would mean something like “that which disintegrates repeatedly/continually.” The Tibetan translation of the Vajratuṇḍasamayakalparāja (B, vol. 96, p. 96.3) (the Sanskrit original is currently being studied by Gergely Hidas) has g.yog ’dor (sNar thang is reported to read ’khar instead of ’dor) as the rendering of Vārāṇasī. Péter Szántó (oral communication) surmises that g.yog here may be an interpretation of vāra in the sense of parivāra, and ’dor seems to be a rendering of √as (“to throw, cast”, see MW, s.v. 2). See comments in Waddell 1914: 41, n. 32, where g.yog ’dor is understood literally as “servant thrown off or forsaken or striding.” Since the Sanskrit text of the Vajratuṇḍasamayakalparāja has Vārāṇasī, the reconstruction (i.e. urana+dāsa) suggested by Waddell turns out to be wrong."

It is obvious that ’chang is a rendering of √dhā in the sense of “holding” or “possessing” (MW, s.v. dha). But it is not obvious how one can account for the rendering dbus ’gyur. A conceivable possibility is that Tibetan translators interpreted maga as an abbreviation of madhyaga “going or being in the middle or among (with gen. or ifc.)” (MW).

Some of the major arguments within this controversy are recorded for instance in Sujayaśrīgupta’s Abhiṣekanirukti. Among exegetical traditions that accept a “Fourth,” a mainstream interpretation has become established in the sense of an oral transmission by the Guru."

The fact that in the higher Tantric systems the prajñājñāna consecration came to be a primary condition for entry into the Tantric path, and that it involves the initiand’s sexual union with a female consort gave rise to considerable amount of scholarly discourse with regard to potential infringements of or conflicts with monastic vows. Extensive discussions in exegetical literature reflect its continued importance in the Higher Tantras, overshadowed only by the establishment of a “Fourth” consecration which came to be frequently regarded as a further culmination. Specific explanations as to the function of the prajñājñānābhiṣeka are rare in relevant literature; a couple of alternative explanatory models are provided in Jinasujayaśrīgupta’s Abhiṣekanirukti (see occurrences below).",

        "Some key points pertaining the headword may be summarized as follows: According to Monica Zin (2003), the grammatical gender of the word initially was feminine but it also came to be used in the masculine (see below). The word/name Kālakarṇī has several referents: (1) The word kālakarṇī,  as a common noun, is used in the sense of “misfortune,” “inauspiciousness,” or “penury.” (2) The deity Kālakarṇī, alias Alakṣmī/Kālī (not as Lakṣmī as von Böhtlingk has it), the antithesis of Śrī/Lakṣmī, the goddess of prosperity/auspiciousness, may be seen as the anthropomorphized or personified form of  “misfortune” or “inauspiciousness.” As Zin demonstrates in her study, the idea that Lakṣmī and Alakṣmī, Śrī and Kālī, are opposites which can never occur in the same locus can be traced to earlier Buddhist sources such as the Tesakuṇajātaka, Mahāummagajātaka, and Sirikālakaṇṇijātaka, and also is found in late Upaniṣadic sources such  as the Mahānārāyaṇopaniṣad and Nṛsiṃhapūrvatāpanīyopaniṣad (see below). (3) Kālakarṇī is also reported by von Böhtlingk to be the name of a yoginī, and a deity bearing this name is included in the Pañcarakṣāmaṇḍala, as described in, for example, Abhayākaragupta’s Vajrāvalī (Mori 2001: 269).  (4) In the Pāli sources (DPPN: vol. 1, pp. 574–575), there seem to be at least three figures bearing the name Kāḷakaṇṇī/Kāḷakaṇṇī, namely,  (a) a friend of Anāthapīṇḍika, (b) the treasurer’s friend in the story of the past given in the Kāḷakaṇṇījātaka, and (c) daughter of Virūpakkha (in the Sirikālakaṇṇījātaka), where she is also called Kāḷī and Alakkhī. (5) According to Śaiva sources, Kālakarṇī is the name of a type of Tantric mudrā. This usage presupposes the sense of Kālakarṇī as a deity. (6) The idea of coincidentia oppositorum of Kālakarṇī and Lakṣmī/Śrī can be found, for example, in the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya and Catuḥśatakaṭīkā and also in the Chinese translation of the Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra and its Tibetan translation.",

The mudrā is formed with the palms facing upwards, the fingers pressed together and turned inside, facing the thumb on each hand, while the tips of the thumbs touch each other. The SvāSS (18.29) prescribes it to be shown at the recitation of the four Vidyāṅgas. The alternative form, kālakaṇṭhī, seems to have evolved as a misreading of kālakarṇī, but the corruption may have occurred the other way round; on a possibly similar confusion, cf. the terms kaṇṭha* and karṇa*.

        "According to some Tibetan sources, the two types of nirodha, namely, pratisaṃkhyānirodha and apratisaṃkhyānirodha, which are by definition asamskṛtadharma-s, are counted among the seven elements that belong to the dharmadhātu (chos khams bdun), which are the objects of mental perception. This is in accordance with the Abhidharma (i.e. Sarvāstivāda) tradition that presupposes three asamskṛtadharma-s, the other four being vedanāskandha, saṃskāraskandha, saṃjñāskandha, and avijñaptirūpa. For the Abhidharmasamuccaya tradition, the two types of nirodha belong to the group of  sixteen  elements that make up the dharmadhātu (i.e. five kinds of special rūpa, vedanāskandha, saṃskāraskandha, saṃjñāskandha, and eight kinds of asamskṛtadharma-s which include the two types of nirodha)."

The other three “knots” are covetousness (abhidhyā; Pāli: abhijjhā), malevolence (vyāpāda; Pāli: byāpāda), and clinging to observances and vows (śīlavrataparāmarśa; Pāli: sīlabbataparāmāsa).\\nAccording to the Dhammasaṅgaṇi, idaṃsaccābhinivesa is the stubborn holding to the views that the world is permanent, not permanent, etc., with the belief and attitude “only this (idaṃ) is true (sacca), [everything] other [than this view I hold] is false (mogha)."

Since the outer ring borders the profane world, the centre is thus the most sacred area. The maṇḍala depicts a celestial palace inhabited by a chief deity—or a symbol of it in the form of a syllable (bīja)—which is placed in the centre, with associated deities arranged around it in hierarchical order. … [T]he pattern exhibited by maṇḍalas may vary: it can be simple or elaborate, it can have a central figure or not, the central deity may be surrounded by other deities, individual gods may be accompanied by goddesses, and so forth. Nonetheless, in all cases, the maṇḍala provides an abode for the deity and safekeeping for its power.”",

This twofold definition is perhaps based on Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha 1,110,203: athātaḥ saṃpravakṣyāmi mahāmaṇḍalam uttamam | vajradhātupratīkāśaṃ vajradhātur iti smṛtam||.

        "This term occurs in Sanskrit sources referring to someone who has been ‘consecrated’ (lit. ‘sprinkled’) as a king (see the passage from the Suvarṇaprabhāsa quoted below). In the Buddhist context this notion is also used in the framework of the bodhisattva career to mark the anointment of the direct heir of the Buddha (see e.g. the passage from the Mahāvastu quoted below). The term can also be used metaphorically to refer to the salvific activity of the Buddha (see passage of the Milindapañha below), or to the Bodhisattva’s perfection of giving (dānapāramitā) (see the epigraphic verse from Andhra quoted below). In Tantric works, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist, this term is used referring to an adept who has been ‘initiated’ and then received the permission to practice according to the teachings of the system into which he has been initiated. This term occurs alone and also as a member of a compound; it is sometimes replaced (also due to metrical requirements) by periphrastic expressions like prāptābhiṣeka (e.g. in the Pañcakrama, Subhāṣitasaṃgraha, Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati, and Tantrāloka), abhiṣekaprāpta (e.g. the Samādhirājasūtra and Akṣayamatinirdeśa), labdhābhiṣeka (e.g. the Svayaṃbhūpurāṇa, Lalitavistara, and Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa), and abhiṣekalabdha (e.g. the Ratnagotravibhāga and Yogaratnamālā). Sometimes texts describe the advantages deriving from being ‘initiated’; these advantages consist in protection (see e.g. the passage from the Jñānasiddhi cited below) and recognition (see e.g. the passages from Vajrāmṛtatantra and Hevajratantrapiṇḍārthaṭīkā cited below)."

        "Jñānapāda systematized the practice of two Stages (krama) and three Initiations (abhiṣeka), the sources for these being from the Yogottaratantra and Yoganiruttaratantra. The first of the two Stages is the “Stage of Arising (utpattikrama, bskyed rim)” and the second is the “Stage of the Completed/Perfected (utpanna- / niṣpanna- krama, rdzogs rim).”",
        "Among Jñānapāda’s works, the Samantabhadrasādhana (Caturaṅgasādhana) teaches the Stage of Arising, on the other hand, the Muktitilaka is related to  the Stage of the Completed/Perfected. These works were translated into Tibetan by Kamalagupta and Tsa la na Ye shes rgyal mtshan. Kamalagupta worked with Rin chen bzang po after 996 and Tsa la na Ye shes rgyal mtshan translated many important works with him. These texts translated are associated with the Jñānapāda School, including most of *Vitapāda’s works. Rin chen bzang po translated many works of the same school, including the Samantabhadrasādhana, with his teacher Śraddhākaravarman. This imported work has also been translated by Smṛtijñānakīrti. ",
        "In the history of the Guhyasamāja in Tibet, we find that the introduction of the Jñānapāda School is associated with  Seven Branches, namely those of (1) Rin chen bzang po, (2) Smṛtijñānakīrti, (3) Atiśa, (4) gNyen Dar ma grags, (5) Rwa rDo rje grags, (6) gNyos Yon tan grags, and (7) Śākyaśrībhadra. Except for the branch of Smṛtijñānakīrti, these branches originated from the Vikramaśīla Monastery in East India.",

In a dispute among sūtradhara-s, vinayadhara-s, and mātṛkādhara-s, which is referred to in the Adhikaraṇavastu, all three groups claim their (exclusive) right to be entitled as  dharmadhara-s. The mātṛkādhara-s implicitly claim their superiority since they memorize (and transmit) both the svalakṣana and the sāmānyalakṣaṇa of the sūtra[-collection] and of the vinaya[-collection], and not only the totality of one of the two collections, as the other two groups do (see occurrences below).",
        "In two passages of the Śrāvakabhūmi svalakṣaṇa and sāmānyalakṣaṇa occur with the tasi-affix with the common meaning of “in particular” and “in general.” The first passage explains the term cintanā (“reflection, consideration”): the practitioner has to reflect, in particular and in general, upon the dharma-s (except for six specific items) in accordance with the teaching (see occurrences below). The second passage refers to the abandonment of the fourth viparyāsa, i.e. the wrong conception of a Self with regard to what is not (or not endowed with) Self, by the practitioner, here technically called dharmānudarśin, who sees, that is to say contemplates, the dharma-s according to their true nature (see occurrences below).",
        "In the Śrāvakabhūmi the two words are also used with a more technical meaning, referring to the first two ways in which a real object should be considered and examined. The text also describes with more details and according to the typical taxonomical explanations the three and five ways in which a svalakṣaṇa and a sāmānyalakṣaṇa should respectively be seen (see occurrences below).",
        "In epistemological treatises the two terms are used to refer to the “particular” and the “universal”. In Buddhist epistemology the particular is the object of direct perception which cannot be expressed in words, whereas the “universal” is mentally produced and, as such, is defined as the object of inference (cf. Dharmakīrti’s Nyāyabindu 1.16–17: anyat sāmānyalakṣaṇam | so ’numānasya viṣayaḥ |, ed. Malvania pp. 77–78). Cf. also Hetubinduṭīkā, p. 23: svalakṣaṇaviṣayaṃ pratyakṣaṃ sāmānyalakṣaṇaviṣayam anumānam iti vacanāt, where this sentence is quoted by a pūrvapakṣin (see occurrences below)."

Usually it is not so specifically stated, tho the context is apt to suggest that it is zealous cultivation (study or propagation) of sacred texts or religious instruction that is meant (note - that the object of the verb adhimucyate is commonly something of this sort); cf. e. g. -lokaṃ yathādhimuktyā (according to their [varying types or degrees of] zeal or application) subhāṣitena saṃtoṣayantam LV 160.17; adhimuktisāro yo syād … saḥ, puṇyaṃ labheta yo etaṃ (most mss.) sūtraṃ vācel likheta vā SP 342.3–4.

        "“Mantras are magical formulas consisting of syllables or words arranged in a certain fixed manner and regarded as endowed with power and efficacy. As Padoux states in his discussion of mantras in the Hindu context, the belief in the power and efficacy of the mantra has survived in India from the Vedas down to the present. The employment of mantras as a religious instrument or procedure is common to diverse Indian traditions, particularly the Tantric ones. The centrality of mantras to the Tantric traditions is expressed by the fact that the tantraśāstras are often referred to as mantraśāstras, while Buddhist Tantrism is often referred to as Mantrayāna, Mantranaya, or simply Mantra. Nevertheless, as made clear by Padoux, the utterance of a mantra is considered efficient only within the given context of a strictly controlled ritual procedure, which is in turn embedded within a culture that presupposes the mantra’s efficacy. To guarantee their efficacy, mantras must be accurately pronounced, just as the mudrās, which often accompany them, must be accurately performed. According to Padoux, mantras can be properly explained only within an Indian tradition that has a corresponding metaphysical and mythical understanding of ‘speech’ (vāc), or within the traditions which inherited such understanding from India. This is a culture, he says, where speech “has always been considered as essential, as of divine origin, as playing a fundamental role in creation.” Nevertheless, the silent (tūṣṇīm) or mental (mānasa) utterance, he says, was always rated higher than the audible one, and the fact that, from the Vedic to the Tantric period, mantras become more repetitive, increasingly levelling linguistic content and phonetic variety, shows a general tendency towards silence. Padoux cites the ancient belief that thought or consciousness is identical with the highest, silent level of speech not only as one of the reasons for the superiority of silence over actual speech in mantric practice, but also as explaining why the function of the mantra is considered inseparable from the mind of its user. As already mentioned, mantras do not always have an obvious meaning, and Padoux points out that it is their inner organization and phonetic structure that are more important. Furthermore, they are significant or meaningful only within a particular ritual activity where they are considered active. In the case where mantras seem to ‘name’ a deity, Padoux notes, they are in fact an audible expression (vācaka) of the deity; to utter the deity’s mantra is to evoke or conjure its power. In other words, when the mantra is focused on, “the attention of the user may pass on to another plane, be it a postulated inner nature or essence of the mantra or some higher, transcendent reality of which the mantra is the expression (vācaka) and which would be intuited nondiscursively by the user through an intense and concentrated mental effort (dhāraṇa or bhāvanā).”\\nThere are various types of formulas, of which the most common ones are (1) mantra ((gsang) sngags; lit. ‘speech’), (2) dhāraṇī (gzungs (sngags); lit. ‘holding,’ ‘keeping (in remembrance),’ ‘retention’), often understood as a kind of mnemonic formula, (3) vidyā (rig sngags; lit. ‘knowledge’), a formula which, as is evident from its designation, is associated with the acquirement of knowledge, (4) hṛdaya (snying po; lit. ‘heart,’ ‘quintessence’), which is conceived as the ‘personal spell’ of a deity, and (5) bīja (sa bon; lit. ‘[phonic] seed’ or ‘germ’), a single syllable conceived of as comprehending the essence of a particular deity. These terms are often used interchangeably to denote more or less the same thing. \\nAccording to Rong-zom-pa, the mantra, as a generic term for the various kinds of magical formulas, expresses the union of insight and stratagem, which union in turn is conceived as an expression of Buddhahood in some of the Tantric systems. The signs of these formulas, which are employed as means of attaining Buddhahood, are viewed by him as the various manifestations of the buddhas, with mantras being the manifestations of male deities, and vidyās and dhāraṇīs of female ones.”\\n",

        "The set of three kinds of duḥkhatā already appears in (arguably later strata of) the canonical sermons of Nikāya Buddhism.",
        "It is generally recognized in Buddhism that there are not only painful or disagreeable (duḥkha) but also agreeable (sukha) and neutral sensations. However, the latter two can be regarded as characterized by unsatisfactoriness (duḥkhatā), too, since happiness is inherently liable to change and decay (vipariṇāma) and since neutral sensations can be associated with the most fundamental kind of unsatisfactoriness, viz., the inherent impermanence of all conditioned entities (saṃskāra). According to Schmithausen, this restriction of the application of the three kinds of unsatisfactoriness to the three kinds of sensations/feelings (vedanā) seems to mark the first step in the development of the concept.",
        "Vasubandhu in his Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, however, restricts the character of being unsatisfactory in at least one of these three ways to only those conditioned entities that are contaminated (sāsrava), i.e. those that do not constitute  the Buddhist way to salvation. This view is typical for the later Sarvāstivādins and Yogācāras.",
        "The set of three kinds of duḥkhatā is of central importance for the question of how the fundamental Buddhist belief that mundane existence (saṃsāra) is inherently characterized by “duḥkha” was justified and understood in mainstream Buddhism.",
        "According to Schmithausen, later on, the three kinds of duḥkhatā were interpreted in such a way that they do not only refer to the three kinds of sensations (vedanā), but to mundane existence (saṃsāra) as a whole.",

The recent MSS. ABC simply end with the words Maitrakanyakāvadānaṃ samāptam, and in the subscriptions to the several legends they never add any general title; but the two older transcripts DE always prefix iti śrīdivyāvadāne, to each subscription as well as to the final one. This title also occurs in the Paris MS.

The individual parts of the text, mostly avadānas but occasionally also of the sūtra type, have different sources and dates (Tatelman, 2000, 12f.), which can easily be deduced by the diversity of theme, ideology, language, and style. All manuscripts hitherto known by the title Divyāvadāna(mālā) come from Nepal, and none is older than the 17th century. Concerning the narratives and their arrangement, they do not have much in common apart from a shared core of only seven narratives (according to Iwamoto, 1967, 143–149; see also Rotman, 2008, 8–5). One version with 38 narratives has been edited, entitled Divyāvadāna (Cowell &amp; Neil, 1886; no. 38, however, is a later accretion to the archetype of the manuscripts used by Cowell &amp; Neil; comp. Hahn, 2010a, 86), though no title occurs with the manuscripts used by the editors (comp. Cowell &amp; Neil, 1886, viif.) Since, however, both titles, Divyāvadāna and Divyāvadānamālā, can be found in colophons of other manuscripts known so far (comp. the descriptive catalogue of the Nepalese-German Manuscript Cataloguing Project [NGMCP]), they should be seen as merely conventional designations as long as they are not used with regard to single manuscripts or clear-cut recensions of the textual tradition ... It is still uncertain whether the different versions that have been handed down can be traced back to one single source or whether the title Divyāvadāna(mālā) rather functioned as a kind of genre term. The date of the collection(s) also remains obscure.”"

In non-Tantric Mahāyāna sources, such as the Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra and *Vajracchedikāṭīkā, the term agrayāna would refer to the Bodhisattvayāna/Pāramitāyāna.

        "In Tibetan translations of Indic works, we seem to find two different renderings of ekāyana, which presuppose two different interpretations.

        "The compound ekāyana is frequently used in Pañcarātra/Pāñcarātra literature as an epithet of the system itself and of its teachings.  This compound seems to sometimes be used with the aim of stressing  that the Pāñcarātra represents the higher level of the Vedic revelation (see below Śrīpraśnasaṃhitā 2.38ab). In some passages (see below Īśvarasaṃhitā 1.18cd–19, 21.534cd and Pārameśvarasaṃhitā 1.57cd–58ab), the word ekāyana seems to have a strong anti-inclusivist flavour, implying that only the Pāñcarātra provides the devotees with a path leading to liberation. The word has also been used as a bahuvrīhi compound since the earliest works of the system as a reference to the four Vyūhas (Vāsudeva, Saṃkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha) and to a specific group of devotees (see below, Sātvatasaṃhitā 24.302ab, and the last stanza of the first chapter, perhaps originally an independent work [R. Torella’s personal communication], of the Saṃvitprakāśa by Vāmanadatta: ekāyane prasūtasya kaśmīreṣu dvijātmanaḥ | kṛtir vāmanadattasya seyaṃ bhagavadāśrayā ||). For further details, see below, Discussion in Secondary Sources. See also",
        "In astronomical works the compound ekāyana is used in the sense of “one solstitial half” and ekāyanagata is contrasted with viparītāyanagata (see below Sūryasiddhānta 11.1–2). Cf.",
        "Since the word ekāyana often serves as an adjective qualifying mārga, many of the modern renderings listed above reflect the word as if it were always in conjunction with mārga. See the entry on ekāyanamārga for more information."

        "“( = Pali id.), (1) one of the four guardians of the cardinal directions, corresponding to Skt. lokapāla, and called by this name Dharmas 7, MSV i.255.17, and Mvy 3145 as sometimes in Pali, but usually mahārāja(n) in both Pali and BHS: catvāro (°raś ca) mahārājāno or °rājā LV 202.13; 366.11; Divy 218.9; Av i.67.10; ii.104.2, 12; instr. Mv i.230.12; often, as in some of the above, included in lists of other gods; mahārājasthānam SP 264.12, the position of world-guardian, as one of five states which a woman cannot attain. Pali and BHS differ from Skt. in the names assigned to the four individuals, except that Kuvera (Kubera), oftener called Vaiśravaṇa (Pali Vessavaṇa), sometimes Dhanada or other synonyms, is the guardian of the north, as usually in Skt. The other three (in Skt. normally Indra, Yama, and Varuṇa) are Dhṛtarāṣṭra (east), Virūḍhaka (rarely Virūḍha; south), and Virūpākṣa (west; Pali Dhataraṭṭha, Virūļha(ka), and Virūpakkha). These four are named, Dharmas 7 (as lokapāla); Mvy 3146–9 (as prec, lokapālaḥ 3145); SP 4.6-7; LV 217.16, 20; 218.4, 9; Suv 64.2–3; LV 382.19 ff. (names 384.6, 10, 11, 15, 16, 20, 21; 385.3); LV 388.3, 389.1, 21, 390.19 = Mv iii.306.9, 307.13, 308.13, 309.13; Mmk 654.21; the four are mentioned as devādhipatayaḥ among the kāmāvacara gods whom Māra perceives as favoring the Bodhisattva, LV 302.5–6; and elsewhere in lists of other gods, e. g. Mv i.245.8-9 where Vaiśravaṇa is separated in the list of gods from the other three; sometimes not all are named, thus only Virūḍhaka, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Kubera (with other gods) Mmk 434.27-435.1; only Vaiśravaṇa and Virūḍhaka, both styled mahārājo, SP 398.8, 399.5; only Virūḍhaka Mv iii.72.3 (mahārājo), and 84.1, 6; Indro Virūḍhakādyāś ca (-ādya including the other three?) Laṅk 367.14; in some of the above the fact is mentioned that Vaiśravaṇa is lord of the yakṣas, Dhṛtarāṣṭra of gandharvas, Virūḍhaka of kumbhāṇḍas, and Virūpākṣa of nāgas; these functions, rather than their position as mahārāja (lokapāla), are exclusively noted in Mvy 3367 (Vaiśr°, first of yakṣas), 3381 (Dhṛt°, of gandharvas), 3437 (Virūḍhaka, of kumbhāṇḍas; no similar statement in Mvy about Virūp°); and, in longer lists of gods, also in Divy 126.6-8; 148.18-19; Av i.108.8-9; Gv 249.24-250.2. The forms of the names Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Virūpākṣa never vary; Virūḍha without final -ka (also recorded in Pali) has been noted only Av i.108.9 and Mmk 654.21 (here vs, perhaps m.c.); Vaiśravaṇa (see also °ramaṇa) is the regular form, for which Kuvera or Kub° is found Dharmas 7; LV 218.9; 390.19 = Mv iii.309.13; Mmk 435.1; Dhanada Divy 126.8; 148.19; Av i.108.9; yakṣarāṭ Mmk 654.21 (vs). In MSV i.258.2 ff. Dhrtarāṣṭra and Virūḍhaka are said to be Aryans (ārya-jātīya), Virūpākṣa and Vaiśravaṇa Dasyus; the Buddha resolves to convert them using āryā vāc and dasyuvāc respectively; he then preaches to the first two in normal BHS, to the others (259.2, 7) using what appear to be meaningless groups of sounds.”",

The Four Limbs are worship (sevā, q.v. respectively sevāvidhāna, q.v.), near realisation (upasādhana, q.v.), realisation (sādhana, q.v.) and realisation par excellence (mahāsādhana, q.v.). In the exegetical literature relating to the Guhyasamājatantra, the application of the aṅgacatuṣṭaya varies depending on the respective tradition: in the Ārya tradition, the set of four limbs covers the entire generation process of the presiding deity and its maṇḍala, whereas in the Jñānapāda school, the set of four is applied separately  for each, the main deity, the consort and the deities of the maṇḍala. The threefold application is accounted for by a further terminological differentiation into gentle (mṛdu), middling (madhya) and exceeding (adhimātra). Exegetical literature frequently presents the correlation of the Four Limbs with associated terminological sets such as the four kāya-s or the five jñāna-s."

From an Abhidharmic point of view, a deva is a heavenly/divine being, usually endowed with splendour and power, who, on account of mundane/defiled merits, is spontaneously born in one of the six uppermost realms of the sphere of sexual desire (kāmadhātu), or in the sphere of (fine) matter / the sphere associated with corporeality (rūpadhātu), or in the sphere of immateriality / the sphere not associated with corporeality (ārūpyadhātu), and who subsequently, due to the exhaustion of the merits, falls to a lower realm of existence. Later Buddhist sources often classify such divine beings into mundane (laukika) and supramundane (lokottara) on the basis of soteriological criteria: ordinary beings (pṛthagjana) who are born in the celestial realms on account of their wholesome actions are considered laukika, and noble beings (ārya) who assume the form of a celestial being are considered lokottara."

Elāpattra, by error; Mironov Ela° with no v.l.); Suv 162.9; Mmk 452.20; Kv 2.9; Māy 222.3; 247.2; certainly the same as the Elapatra (mss.; ed. wrongly em.

Mv iii.383.18 ff. above), (Divy 61.1) atha catvāro mahārājāś caturmahānidhisthāḥ, (3-4, vs) Piṅgalaś ca Kaliṅgeṣu Mithilāyāṃ ca Pāṇḍukaḥ, Elapatraś ca Gāndhāre Śaṅkho Vārāṇasīpure. Besides the Pali parallel, DN comm. above, cf. the 9 treasures of Kubera which include Śaṅkha and Padma (with presiding personages of the same names), and among the Jains the 9 treasures of a cakra-vartin, which in their AMg. forms include piṃgala, paṇḍua (= pāṇḍuka), and saṃkha; the Skt. forms of these are recorded at least lexically. Note also in Pali the nāga-king Erakapatta, of Dhp. comm. iii.231 ff., who however does not seem to be brought into relation to the ‘treasure’ called in Pali ela (above); but the vss attributed to him, and the replies to them, in Dhp. comm. are reproduced in Mv iii.384, see above.”",

        "Harunaga Isaacson (Isaacson 2008a: 3, n. 15) points out that Virūpa is actually understood as a short form of Virūpākṣa and that the Vanaratna Codex always uses the longer form. Of the two Tibetan renderings of the name Virūpa provided above, “Ngan pa” renders virūpa (“ugly” or “unnatural”) and “sPyan gsum (pa)” presupposes the full form Virūpākṣa (“having unnatural/unusual eyes”), which is originally a name of Śiva, so-called because he has three eyes. This is precisely also one of the two explanations that we find in the Madhyavyutpatti or sGra sbyor bam po gnyis pa (no. 170, cited under the entry “Virūpākṣa”), and hence it has been translated there as “mig mi ’dra ba” (“unusual eyes”) and  “mig mi bzang” (“awful/ghastly eyes”).",

A number of fragments which are explicitly stated to come from the Sarvajñasiddhi can thus be collected. But this collection can be considerably enlarged in the following way. A. Thakur has already noted that Ratnakīrti, Jñānaśrīmitra’s pupil, when composing his own Sarvajñasiddhi, has not only used his teacher’s Yoginirṇayaprakaraṇam, but also his Sarvajñasiddhi…  Ratnakīrti’s Sarvajñasiddhi thus shows the general characteristic of his works which present the main points of his teacher’s essays on the same subject in the style of a strictly formal, logical argumentation.”"

Buddhist logicians classify a pseudo-reason as belonging to one of three types: unestablished (asiddha), inconclusive (anaikāntika), or opposed (viruddha), with various sub-classifications for each of these types.  The class of a pseudo-reason depends on the way in which it deviates from the three requirements: if the property used as a reason is not, in fact, present in the case that the inference is about, it is an unestablished reason; if the reason-property is present not only in cases that have the property to be proven, but also in cases which do not have that property, i.e., in the vipakṣa, then the reason-property is inconclusive; if it is present only in the vipakṣa, it is opposed.",
        "“When one turns to consider what Indian logicians have to say about  fallacies of the hetu, one is struck by the lack of agreement on such topics not only between philosophers of different schools but also between Naiyāyikas themselves. In part this reflects the difficulty felt by everyone about getting any rigorous classification of fallacies, but it is even more apparent that our philosophers were victimized by a horrible confusion over terminology.”"

In this sense it can be either used in the same meaning as mantra, or it can denote a particular type of magical spell. In the course of time, the magical formulas came to be identified with deities. In accordance with the grammatical gender, vidyā is associated with goddesses and mantra with male deities. The term vidyā may also refer to apotropaic texts.",
        "Rong zom pa in his rGyud spyi’i dngos po treats vidyā (rig sngags) along with mantra (gsang sngags) and dhāraṇī (gzungs sngags) as a subtype of mantra (sngags) and goes on to explain each from the point of view of their actual nature (rang gi ngo bo), subclass (rab tu dbye ba), function (las), symbolical representation (rtags), means of access (sgo), factors opposed to them (mi mthun pa’i phyogs) and their antidotes (gnyen po), properties common to them (chos mthun pa), properties uncommon to each (tha dad chos), all possible applications (ji snyed ’jug pa), and their etymologies (nges pa’i tshig). According to Rong zom pa, vidyā is associated with the acquirement of knowledge. It “makes [one] cognize the [true] meaning of things in that it destroys and eliminates non-realization.” And “it manifests as female deities, and its essence is of the [combined] nature of insight and gnosis.” He further provides the following etymologies: “[The term] rig sngags [is the Tibetan rendering of the Sanskrit] vidyā, [which is associated with the words] (i) vidhūta, which means ‘destroying’ and ‘eliminating,’ and hence [vidyā] is explained as that which destroys and eliminates the defilements consisting in ignorance, (ii) vindati, which conveys [the meaning of] ‘attainment,’ and hence [vidyā] refers to the attainment of excellences or to the attainment of speech cognition, or (iii) vidyāsvabhāva, where ‘essence’ (ngo bo nyid: svabhāva) refers to knowledge, and in general expresses the meaning of the realized truth as well, and therefore [it] is called rig sngags.”",

        "The most common interpretation of the word in traditional Indian sources seems to be as a bahuvrīhi with the noun daśā “state” as second member. The word would then literally mean “those having [only] three states,” i.e. birth (janma), existence (sattā), and death (vināśa), having no old age. It is this understanding that underlies the Tibetan rendering skabs gsum pa (see one of the two explanations of the word found in the Tshig mdzod chen mo and cited below under “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Tibetan Autochthonous Works”). It should be noted, however, that both in traditional Indian sources and in modern scholarship other explanations of the word have been put forward, e.g. that it may mean the (approximately) three times ten, in other words might have originally been equivalent to trayastriṃśa (cf., e.g., the Tibetan rendering sum cu rtsa gsum pa’i lha mentioned above and the citation from the Avadānaśataka provided under “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Indic”). See for other interpretations also the citation from Amara: South Indian Commentaries provided under “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Indic.” One more interpretation of skabs gsum pa mentioned in the Tshig mdzod chen mo (see below “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Tibetan Autochthonous Works”) is “those who know three states, namely, the preceding state, present state, and following state.”"

        "The prehistory and history of the term śaṅkhasvarasamācāra seem to be rather complex. There seems to have been uncertainty or confusion already in Pāli sources. The Chinese rendering in Guṇabhadra’s translation of the Saṃyuktāgama (吹貝之聲) seems to be based on a reading śaṅkhasvarasamācāra. Xuanzang translates as if reading *śaṅkhasvaraśvānācāra (螺音狗行). However, it is not impossible that the use of a word meaning “dog” rather than “donkey” is based on a somewhat different interpretation of the expression. The Tibetan tradition, on the other hand, seems to consistently have rendered the term as lung bong ltar spyod pa or lung bong ltar kun tu spyod pa or bong bu ltar kun tu spyod pa (“one who conducts himself like a domestic ass”), an interpretation which is supported by Vasubandhu’s explanation in his Vyākhyāyukti. One may speculate that śaṅkhasvara may have been intended, or at least interpreted, as meaning “an animal who makes a sound like the sound of a conch, i.e. a donkey.” Compare the verses from the *Gardabhasūtra cited below under Occurrences in Primary Sources: Indic.

N. of a Ṛṣi (author of several Vedic hymns; said to have been the son of both Mitra and Varuṇa by Urvaśī; to have been born in a water-jar; to have been of short stature; to have swallowed the ocean, and compelled the Vindhya mountains to prostrate themselves before him; to have conquered and civilized the South; to have written on medicine, …) … the star Canopus (of which Agastya is the regent, said to be the ‘cleanser of water’, because of turbid waters becoming clean at its rising.”",
        "As one can see, the name Agastya has been rendered into Tibetan in at least two ways, namely, (a) Ri ’dor/’phen (Saṃ bod shan sbyar, p. 4) and (b) Nyes ’dor (Vajratuṇḍasamayakalparāja-Tib, B, p. 104.12). The former presupposes the interpretation: Agastya (or Agasti) = aga (“mountain”) + asti (“thrower,” from √as). Thus it has been rendered into Tibetan as Ri ’dor/’phen “Mountain Hurler.” To be sure, a+ga means “not going/moving” and hence “a mountain” (among other things). The latter Tibetan rendering presupposes the following understanding by the translators: Agastya (or Agasti) = āga (i.e. āgas and āga “sin” as in anāga “sinless”) + asti “thrower” (cf. MW, s.v. āgas “transgression, offence, injury, sin, fault”) and thus Nyes ’dor would mean something like “Fault Eliminator/Avoider.” Or, as suggested by Isaacson, Tibetan translators might have taken agas to be āgas “sin” and tya to be √tyaj “to abandon.”"

The mūlapraṇidhāna is the core aspiration, which will define the future buddha-identity of the individual who makes it.

        "If interpreted in a natural way, the compound śūnyāgāra can hardly be understood in any other way than meaning “empty house,” and it is quite certain that this was the intended meaning of the word in its original canonical context.  However, in the Yogācārabhūmi, there is a tendency to interpret the word as an umbrella term for some of the solitary places mentioned in the long canonical list of  places suitable for meditation (see “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Indic” below). This must be the reason why some Tibetan translators prefer to render the term as “free from houses” (khyim gyis stong pa, as if translating an original *āgāraśūnya) in certain contexts. Edgerton’s rendering “solitude” is only justifiable in such or similar exceptional contexts as well. Xuanzang, the Chinese translator of the Yogācārabhūmi, seems to stick to a rendering meaning “empty house” throughout.",

Heinrich Wenzel in his German translation of the Suhṛllekha has considered mThong ldan as an abbreviated form of dGe ba mthong ldan (Wenzel 1886: 9).

In fact, Candragomin’s Śiṣyalekha is said to have been written for Ratnakīrti (see the citation from the rGya gar chos ’byung below). It has been pointed out (in Chattopadhyaya &amp; Chimpa 1970: 27) that the two Indian commentaries, namely, Vairocanarakṣita’s Śiṣyalekhaṭippaṇa and Prajñākaramati’s Śiṣyalekhavṛtti, offer different reasons why Candragomin wrote his Śiṣyalekha. According to the former, Candragomin wrote the Śiṣyalekha to prevent his student Ratnakīrti from going into politics. According to the latter, Candragomin wrote the Śiṣyalekha to dissuade his student (not mentioned by name) from having an affair with a princess. Ratnakīrti also reportedly composed a commentary on Candrakīrti’s Madhyamakāvatāra (Chattopadhyaya &amp; Chimpa 1970: p. 227)."

        "There seem to be two regions or countries with the name Aśvaka, namely, one in the north-west, and one in the south. Aśvaka in the sense of one of the sixteen mahājanapada-s is said to be the one in the south. In Buddhist Pāli sources, it is called Assaka (CPD), and in Sanskrit sources Aśmaka as well as Aśvaka (see the next key information by Isaacson). The CPD does record the Sanskrit name Aśmaka but not Aśvaka (in the sense of the name of a mahājanapada). A list of the sixteen mahājanapada-s transmitted via the Tibetan translation of the *Vasiṣṭhasūtra (gNas ’jog gi mdo), translated by sKa ba dPal brtsegs, has already been noted by Dan Martin (https://sites.google.com/site/tibetological/tibet-at-the-center). The list has also been cited in dPal brtsegs’s gSung rab rin po che’i gtam. The difficulty with the list found in Tibetan sources is identifying the proper Sanskrit names. One such name that poses a difficulty is “Sreg pa.” This is clearly a translation and not a phonetic transcription. In the *Vasiṣṭhasūtra (gNas ’jog gi mdo), it is spelled “Sreg pa,” whereas in the  gSung rab rin po che’i gtam, it is spelled “Srag pa.” As for the Sanskrit name, according to Negi’s dictionary, “Aśmaka,” as one of the mahājanapada-s, has been rendered into Tibetan as “rDo can.” It also appears that “Sreg pa” is a rendering of Aśvaka. Aśvaka is supposed to mean something like “a small or bad horse” or “a toy-horse” (MW). Tibetan “sreg pa” (according to Jäschke 1881) means a “partridge” (cf. also brDa dkrol gser gyi me long, s.v. srag pa: bya bye brag pa zhig gi ming; also note Jäschke’s remark on the Western-Tibetan pronunciation of sreg pa: “W. *s̀rag-pa*”). In the Tshig mdzod chen mo (s.v. gong ma sreg), the bird is referred to as “bya sreg pa,” a bird which is said to be similar to a “bya gong mo” (also called “lha bya gong mo” or “spang bya sreg pa”). Some sources identify it to be a “grouse” (Jäschke 1881: s.v. gong mo). But can Aśvaka mean a certain kind of bird? MW does state that Aśvaka also means a “sparrow,” though attested only lexically (L), but this might have been the basis for the Tibetan rendering “Sreg pa.” Old Tibetan documents (e.g. Pelliot tibétain 1285) do allude to “bya’ sreg pa.”",

      "keyinfo": [
        "Of the four or five Indian commentaries in Tibetan translation on the Bhadracarī, the *Bhadracarīpraṇidhānarājaṭīkā is ascribed to one Indian author whose Sanskrit name has been rendered into Tibetan as “rGyan bzang po.” Whether he and Śākyamitra each composed a separate ṭīkā or whether they co-authored one ṭīkā seems worth investigating. The name in Tibetan is well attested in some of the earliest catalogues and other textual witnesses and hence it is not an issue here. Already in 1912, in his German dissertation on the Bhadracarī, Kaikioku Watanabe (Watanabe 1912: 23) reconstructed the name as (Vi)bhūṣaṇabhadra or Alaṃkārabhadra. But he was cautious. He conceded: “The exact form of the name of the author remains undetermined because the name is otherwise unknown” (“Die genaue Form des Verfassernamens bleibt unbestimmt, weil er sonst unbekannt ist”). Dan Martin in his Tibskrit has reconstructed “rGyan bzang po” as *Subhūṣita. However, in the same Tibskrit, Martin records “Bhadrapaṇa” to which he adds “Author of a commentary on the Bzang po spyod pa’i smon lam. It’s listed as no. 5515 in the Peking Tanjur. Schaik, Prayer, p. 185” (i.e. van Schaik 2009: 185). In Herrmann-Pfandt 2008: 319, the bZang po spyod pa’i smon lam (P 5515) in question here has already been identified as the *Bhadracarīpraṇidhānarājaṭīkā by “rGyan bzang po.” There is a remark in German (“Identifikation eindeutig”). The Sanskrit name of the author is given as Bhadrāpaṇa in Herrmann-Pfandt 2008: 319, without any further comment. The bilingual name has been indexed (pp. 466, 472) and the orthography of the name in Sanskrit is consistently Bhadrāpaṇa. The question is how can we explain the correspondence between the Sanskrit and Tibetan forms of the name. There is no difficulty with bhadra and bzang po. Presumably those who proposed the name bhadrāpaṇa understood as  bhadra + āpaṇa. The second component of the name cannot possibly be apaṇa. But can āpaṇa mean rgyan? According to MW (s.v. āpaṇa), it means “a market, a shop,” “waves” or “commerce, trade” (only recorded in lexicons). But there seems to be no element that could correspond to Tibetan rgyan in this word. And does the Tibetan word really mean “ornament” or “ornamented” as the earlier attempts of reconstruction presupposed? But before we answer this, let us consider the orthography Bhadrapaṇa that Martin gives based on van Schaik 2009: 185. In fact, we already find Bhadrapaṇa for rGyan bzang po in de la Vallée Poussin 1962 (p. 56). According to MW (s.v. paṇa), it can mean “paṇa m. (ifc. f(ā).) play, gaming, playing for a stake, a bet or a wager (with gen.; loc. or ifc.; paṇaṃ√kṛ, to make a bet; paṇe ni√as, to stake at play),” “the thing staked or the sum played for, wages, hire, reward.” But the question is whether such a meaning could agree with the meaning of the Tibetan word rgyan? In fact, it can. According to Jäschke 1881 (s.v. rgyan, II1–2), rgyan can, as a noun, mean “a stake or pledge at play” and “lot” and in a verbal construction (as in rgyan btsugs/rgyab) it can mean “to bet” or “to wager.” This is also confirmed by the Tshig mdzod chen mo (s.v. rgyan 2): rgyal dang skugs, ... sho sbag brgyab nas rgyan rgyal ba, ... dngul zong ci rigs kyi rgyan ’gyed pa, ... shing bu dang, rde’u sogs bsgrugs te rgyan rgyag pa, ... rgyal pham thob shor gyi ched du rgyan ’phen pa, ... rtsed mo thob shor gyi ched du dngul ’bor chen rgyan du btsugs pa. Thus I propose that the word rgyan in the name “rGyan bzang po” means something like “bet” or “lot,” and that the Sanskrit name probably was Bhadrapaṇa, and meant something like “Good Bet” or “Good Lot,” or, as a bahuvrīhi, “With a Good Lot/Stake.”"

AK 2.4.35 gsal byed (46bl) for kāśmarī and AK 2.4.36 snaṅ-ldan (46bl) for kāśmarya. gsal-bar byed-pa is known to render Sanskrit prakāśate (Lokesh Chandra). The variety of spellings points to this word being a loanword and since kāśmarya is generally identified as Gmelina arborea Roxb. (Kirtikar and Basu, III, 1932–4; G. J. Meulenbeld, The Mādhavanidāna, Leiden 1974, 543) «white teak», a purely Indian tree, an Indian origin should be sought. Unless it is a complete corruption of Sanskrit gambhārī, a synonym of kāśmarya, no suitable Indian source has yet been found. The Khotanese version of the Siddhasāra has kaśmīrye at all three occurrences: 2.15,25 3.22.12 (Chii.002.12r4,14rl and 19rl). It is remarkable that the Khotanese has kaśmīrye also to render Sanskrit śrī-parṇī, said by Siddhasāra-nighaṇṭu 71 to be synonymous with kāśmarī, whereas the Tibetan does not once use taṃ-bal but always a transcription of śrī-parṇī. In the Siddhasāra śrī-parṇī occurs at 2.7,24,28 5.35,53. The last two places are not extant in Khotanese. śrī-parṇī seldom occurs in Vāgbhata’s Ah. At Utt. 20.12 we find a transcription: śi-ri parṇi (D 285a4), śi-dri-par-ni (P 264a5). The use of kaśmīrye in Khotanese suggests that Tibetan bal may be intended to mean «Nepalese» but one would expect bal to be the first element of the compound rather than the second.”",

        "“tsag-tsag is found in the dictionaries of Chos-kyi grags-pa and Sumatiratna, but it is helpful to draw attention to its use in bilingual texts. It is evidently a derivative of gtsag-pa «to pierce, prick» recorded by Das. Another derivative is btsags-bu, which is described by Jäschke as a «lancet for bleeding», btsags-bu (btsags N, gtsags D, btsag P) occurs in Si 26.88 as a rendering of Sanskrit śastra, which is used there of an instrument for piercing pimples in the throat. The Khotanese has (156v3) prriharaṃ jsa «with a praharaṇa», the usual Khotanese rendering of Sanskrit śastra. Si 26.81 concerns the characteristics of tongue disease that has arisen due to bile. They are: lce rtsub-cing tsha-ba hur-hur-por ’dug-la tsag-tsag tsha-ba «the tongue is rough, there is gentle warmth, and it has hot pricks». This is a rendering of Sanskrit sa-dāhaiḥ kaṇṭakaiḥ «with hot prickles». The Khotanese omits the prickles altogether and has biśā’-v-ī ysīrrä hame u ttaudā-v-ī va hame «one’s tongue becomes rough and warmth arises for one». tsag-tsag is attested in the Tibetan version of Vāgbhaṭa’s Ah, Su.10.5. There we find to render udvejayati jihvāgraṃ kurvaṃś cimicimāṃ kaṭur, which is translated by Hilgenberg and Kirfel: «die scharfe (Geschmacksqualität) lässt dadurch, dass sie Prickeln hervorruft, die Zungenspitze emporzucken», in the Tibetan version tsha-ba lce-rtse skye byed-cing [||] tsag-tsag byed-par ’gyur-ba dang [||] «the pungent (taste) makes the tip of the tongue extend and pricking is caused (by it)». Thus, tsag-tsag corresponds to Sanskrit cimicimā «pricking». Indu comments: cimicimām agnijvālā-saṃparśam iva karoti «it causes pricking like contact with the flame of a fire».”",

        "“According to Amarasiṁha (AmK 2.2(pura-varga).4a2b), an eḍūka is a walled structure in which bones are deposited (eḍūkaṃ yad-antar-nyasta-kîkasam /). The best discussion of the terms eḍūka/aiḍūka to date is Bakker (2007); see also Allchin (1957). Contrary to the aiḍūka (for which the locus classicus is Viṣṇu-dharmôttara-purāṇa 3.84.1–15, quoted and discussed in Bakker (2007: 12, n. 4, and 12–13)), which did not contain any physical remnants of the dead, eḍūkas can be defined as ‘[b]urial mounds or sepulchral monuments that actually contain the ashes and/or bones of the deceased’ (2007: 19); for a physical description, see Bakker (2007: 43). According to Bakker (2007: 40), ‘we may take it for certain that the author of the VDhP calqued his Hindu aiḍūka on a Buddhist example [see already Bakker (2007: 13–14)—V.E.], but by doing this he elaborated on what must have been a monumental tradition that was common to all Indian religions, most pronounced within Buddhism, less in Jainism and inconspicuous in the Hindu mainstream.’ Referring to the Mahā-bhārata passage under consideration, Bakker (2007: 33, n. 76) quotes Allchin (1957: 1) (‘Since Lassen it has been generally accepted that this description of the Kali-yuga refers to the spread of Buddhist practices and the popular desertion of Brahmanical temples.’), and adds: ‘This is not to say, however, that the composer of this passage was exclusively thinking of Buddhism. He might have lashed out at all pan-Indian practices frowned upon by the orthodox that involved the erection of monuments over mortuary remains. Eḍūka thus seems to be a wider term than, for instance, stūpa, and it clearly has here, if not in all cases where it occurs, a pejorative connotation.’”",

        "“2.1. As far as I can see, kuśala and akuśala as adjectives qualifying dharmas are only very rarely used with exclusive or primary reference to the secular level. As an exception, one can, perhaps, adduce a passage near the beginning of the Sanskrit Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra, where the kuśalā dharmāḥ which according to the Buddha will flourish and not decrease among the Vṛjis as long as certain social patterns of behavior are maintained most probably do not refer to moral or religious qualities (which would be beneficial from the karmic and spiritual perspective) but rather to a fortunate, secure, and unassailable economic and political situation. These aspects of secular welfare are, however, by no means detrimental to moral and spiritual growth, and it is hard to imagine that in any Buddhist text an action or attitude that yields profit in this life but entails evil consequences in the afterlife or is spiritually detrimental would be qualified as kuśala. 2.2. Not infrequently, however, the texts point out that dharmas that are (or may be) qualified as kuśala and akuśala in the karmic or spiritual perspective tend to have, respectively, agreeable and disagreeable consequences already in the present life as well. Successfully cultivated spiritual practices, e.g., and especially the various levels of deep meditation, are described as involving a state of non-sensual happiness and equanimity, and keeping the moral precepts not only leads to rebirth in heaven after death but is often described as also entailing happiness in this very life because one is free from contrition and feels at ease among people or in meetings, receives social approval, enjoys economic success due to non-negligence, runs no risk of being punished, and dies a peaceful death. As against this, breaking the moral precepts tends to have the opposite effects. As the Yogācārabhūmi puts it, a person deciding and attempting to kill someone else may succeed in doing so or may fail. In the first case, he will in any case experience painful retribution in the afterlife,  but he may also incur punishment or reproach in the present life. Even if he is unsuccessful, he may incur punishment or reproach in this life or at least suffer from frustration because his attempt failed.”",
        "It should be noted that instead of the compound akuśaladharma (as well as the opposite kuśaladharma), in primary sources we often find the two basic words uncompounded and in the plural. See, for instance, references in SWTF to texts found in Turfan where the word akuśala occurs in connection with the word dharma, usually not in compound and in the plural. "

This example, with the same Sanskrit words for the perceptions but without the words for the subjects (so without the headword or the components thereof), was already given by Dharmakīrti in Pramāṇavārttika Svavṛtti ad Pramāṇavārttika Svārthānumāna 58. The basic idea, but without this specific example, can be found already in Āryadeva’s Catuḥśataka 8.2 and even before that in Aśvaghoṣa’s Saundarananda 13.62.

Naturally enough (since naya and nīti will in normal usage often be synonymous), mantranīti is a common synonym. Mantrayāna is an even more common synonym, sometimes paired with pāramitāyāna. Mantramārga is also used as a synonym, though it is noticeably of rarer occurrence than mantranaya and mantranīti. The order of frequency of use of these terms in Buddhist literature seems to be mantranaya, mantrayāna, mantranīti, mantramārga. Note that in Śaiva literature mantramārga is the most common designation of the Tantric form of Śaivism, while mantranaya, mantranīti, and mantrayāna are virtually unattested. Of these four terms, only mantramārga is current (though much less common than in Śaiva texts) in Vaiṣṇava Pāñcarātra tantric literature."
