jJAna|Sanskrit: jñāna <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of jñāna:{rnam shes/}, {ye shes/}, {shes pa/}, {mkhyen pa/}\n\nEnglish: gnosis, insight, knowledge, wisdom\nThe Sarvāstivādins differentiate between 10 kinds of jñāna.\nThe term is used to denote knowledge in general and the knowledge of the Noble Ones (i.e. those who gained insight into the true nature of reality) in particular. In its Tibetan rendering “ye shes,” which reflects the latter sense, it also has the meaning of “primordially existing knowledge,” which is expressed in the syllable “ye.” However, it appears that this meaning of the syllable “ye” in the word “ye shes” is secondary and that its original meaning is something like “total” or “complete,” denoting the notion that the knowledge of the Noble Ones is “complete.” \n\nIn this context, Schmithausen uses the German rendering “Wissen,” but notes that it might also be understood as “Gewißheit.”\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:22

dIpaMkara|Sanskrit: Dīpaṃkara <Personal Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Dīpaṃkara:{mar me mdzad/}, {mar me mdzad/}\n\nThe legend surrounding the figure of Dīpaṃkara originated in the centuries immediately preceding the turn of the Common Era. Dīpaṃkara developed into a pan-Buddhist figure and a fundamental point of reference for narratives dedicated to the description of past buddhas. He plays, in particular, a fundamental role in the lineages of buddhas under which the future Śākyamuni progressed towards Awakening. The oldest datable text featuring a buddha lineage stemming from Dīpaṃkara is the old Bahubuddhakasūtra tradition. This is transmitted in three versions: (1) a Gāndhārī version, transmitted in an unpublished 1st century BCE/1st century CE Kharoṣṭhī manuscript preserved in the Library of Congress; (2) a version in Buddhist Prakrit-cum-Sanskrit, transmitted in Mahāvastu III.241–250; (3) a Chinese version, preserved in the Fo benxing ji jing (T 190, vol. III, 663b12–664a11, 668c25–672a11). Version (1) preserves a lineage of 15 buddhas, from Dīpaṃkara to Maitreya; Versions (2–3) transmit instead a lineage of 17 buddhas. Closely related versions of this lineage are also found in the Mahākaruṇāpuṇḍarīka (T 380, vol. XII, 962a29–c17; D 111, mDo sde, vol. Cha, 102a7–103a3) and the Mahāśītavana (D 562, rGyud, vol. Pha, 138b7–139a6). In later Pāli literature, Dīpaṃkara commonly features as the primary figure in a lineage of 24 predecessors. See, for instance, Buddhavaṃsa 9–23; Jātaka-aṭṭhakathā 2–30.\nThe story of the encounter between the past Buddha and the future Śākyamuni, then the brahmin Megha (also Sumati, P. Sumedha), is the locus classicus where the notions of adhikāra, praṇidhāna and vyākaraṇa, as the key acts involved in a buddha–bodhisattva encounter, converge. The Bodhisattva is often said to have honored the past Buddha by throwing lotus flowers at him and/or by spreading his hair on a muddy path for the Buddha to walk upon. For an example in Buddhist Sanskrit, see the Dīpaṃkaravastu of the Mahāvastu (I.191–248).\nThe name Dīpaṃkara is variously explained in the Mahāvastu: (1) his body wonderfully emits light; (2) he was born on an island. The latter explanation caused the emergence of the variant name Dvīpaṃkara, due to the secondary Sanskritization of the Middle Indo-Aryan form dīpa, meaning both lamp and island. For the relevant passage below, in “Occurrences in Primary Sources”.\nSeveral Mahāyāna scriptures reinterpret the key moment in the encounter between the future Śākyamuni and Dīpaṃkara, namely the vyākaraṇa imparted by the Buddha to his distant successor, in relation to the acquisition of the “conviction with respect to the non-arising of entities” (anutpattikadharmakṣānti), which marks the status of the Bodhisattva as avaivartika. In the Gaṅgadevībhaginīparivarta of the Aṣṭasāhasrikā and the *Buddhapiṭaka-Duḥśīlanigrahī (T 653; D 220), the Bodhisattva realises the anutpattikadharmakṣānti before receiving the vyākaraṇa, see Aṣṭasāhasrikā 747.19–24; T. 653, vol. XV, 797c29–798a4; D 220, mDo sde, vol. Dza, 57a3–4. In the Dīpaṃkaravyākaraṇa (D 188), the anutpattikadharmakṣānti is realised after the vyākaraṇa. For the Tibetan text and English translation, see Matsumura 2011: 79–80. Similarly, the Dharmapada of the Dharmaguptakas, as cited in Bhāviveka’s Tarkajvālā, alludes to the fact that Śākyamuni attained the eighth bhūmi and the 10 vaśitās when he received the vyākaraṇa from Dīpaṃkara.

vikramaz Ila|Sanskrit: Vikramaśīla <Place Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Vikramaśīla:{rnam par gnon pa/}, {rnam par gnon pa'i ngang tshul/}, {rnam gnon tshul/}\n\nNowadays, scholars usually identify remains of a large monastic establishment excavated in East Bihar near the south banks of the Ganges and the present-day village of Antichak with the monastery of Vikramaśīla.  B.S. Verma published a book-length study on this archaeological site.\nVikramaśīla was one of the most important and famous Buddhist monasteries of ancient and medieval India. It was founded as a royal establishment by one of the first Pāla kings. Sanderson argues that this was done by the third king of the dynasty, namely Devapāla (r. circa 812–850). The monastery was deserted and destroyed around CE 1200.\nA great number of famous teachers, such as Ratnākaraśānti and Abhayākaragupta, who had a wide array of scholarly and religious interests were active there, attracting students and visitors from as far away as Kashmir, Nepal and Tibet. It is generally regarded as one of the greatest strongholds of Tantric Buddhism.\nAmong the textual sources that contain much historical information on Vikramaśīla, Tāranāthaʼs ‘History of Buddhism in Indiaʼ may be singled out. Sanderson argues that this work can be considered relatively trustworthy as far as the later phases of Indian Buddhism are concerned.\nIt should be noted that in the Kathmandu Valley there is yet another ancient monastery that is known by the name Vikramaśīlamahāvihāra, among others. Although it seems that there is a historical relationship between the Indian institution and its Nepalese counterpart, they should not be confused.\n…It seems from the evidence that the different seats of Buddhist learning that functioned in eastern India under the Pālas were regarded together as forming a network, an interlinked group of institutions.\nTāranātha states that various Tantric scholars (gsang sngags slob dpon) were active in the Vikramaśīla monastic seminary such as the “(Twelve Chief) Tantric Teachers of Vikramaśīla” (rnam gnon tshul gyi sngags pa’i slob dpon), namely, (1) Jñānapāda, (2) Dīpaṃkaraśrījñāna, (3) Jayabhadra (= Laṅkā-Jayabhadra), (4) Śrīdhara, (5) Bhavabhadra, (6) Bhavyakīrti, (7) Līlāvajra, (8) Durjayacandra, (9) Samayavajra, (10) Tathāgatarakṣita, (11) Bodhibhadra, and  (12) Kamalarakṣita, and the “Six Gate-[Keeping] Scholars” (mkhas pa sgo drug), namely, (1) Ratnākaraśānti (Eastern Gate), (2) Prajñākaramati (Southern Gate), (3) Vāgīśvarakīrti (Western Gate), (4) Nāropā (Northern Gate), and (5) Ratnavajra (First Central Pillar), and (6) Jñānaśrīmitra (Second Central Pillar).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:10275

Also ascribed to him is a commentary on the Cakrasaṃvaratantra, called the *Vīramanoramā (or *Śūramanojñā, D 1405).\nAccording to Péter-Dániel Szántó, Bhavyakīrti, the author of the *Pradīpoddyotanābhisandhiprakāśikā, may be different from Bhavyakīrti the author of the Cakrasaṃvarapañjikā, since Cakrasaṃvara Bhavyakīrti seems not to know of the fourth initiation (abhiṣeka), whereas Pradīpoddyotana Bhavyakīrti does. He also notes that the phraseology of the two is different; e.g., Cakrasaṃvara Bhavyakīrti has the habit of introducing his own views with “Bhavyakīrti says ...”.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:11306

ratnAkaraz Anti|Sanskrit: Ratnākaraśānti <Personal Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Ratnākaraśānti:{rin chen 'byung gnas zhi ba/}\n\nAccording to Tibetan sources, Ratnākaraśānti was one of those scholars known as the “six gate[-keeping] paṇḍitas” (mkhas pa sgo drug) of the Vikramaśīla monastic seminary, and “the keeper of the eastern gate” (shar sgo srung ba po).\nRatnākaraśānti, an Eastern Indian, was active at the famous monastic center of learning Vikramaśīla in the first half of the 11th century. He appears to have been one of the most learned, prolific, and admired Buddhist authors of his time. A wide range of works on tantric as well as non-tantric Buddhism are attributed to him, and he also authored a handbook of Sanskrit metre, the Chandoratnākara, and a book of ingenious riddles, the Vidagdhavismāpana. Almost certainly, however, some of the works attributed to Ratnākaraśānti are not by the celebrated author of that name. In some cases it appears that a work has been deliberately given this attribution, presumably with the aim of increasing its status or readership (Isaacson, 2010, 267). Several commentaries on tantric texts do survive in Sanskrit, however, that seem to be genuinely by one man, the famous Ratnākaraśānti.\nIn his Madhyamakālaṃkāravṛtti-Madhyamapratipadāsiddhi and Madhyam(ak)ālaṃkāropadeśa Ratnākaraśānti firmly rejects the idea that all is false, stating that it is incompatible with Nāgārjuna’s as well as Maitreyanātha’s and Asaṅga’s teachings. But in both these compositions, which are contained in the Cittamātra (Sems·ćam) section of the bsTan· ’gyur, none of the main lines of development of the Madhyamaka discussed above prevails; and Ratnākaraśānti’s doctrine is in essence a Nirākāra-Vijñānavāda teaching with the Middle Way presented following the system of the three svabhāvas (the parikalpita˚, the paratantra˚ and the pariniṣpanna˚) of the Madhyāntavibhāga for example.\nTo begin with, Jñānaśrīmitra seems to have been a younger contemporary of Ratnākaraśānti, since he cites passages from the latter’s Prajñāpāramitopadeśa in his Sākārasiddhiśāśtra. Both are enumerated among the teachers of Atīśa.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:11332

anAgAmin|Sanskrit: anāgāmin <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of anāgāmin:{phyir mi 'ong ba/}, {lan cig phyir mi 'ong ba/}\n\nThe term anāgāmin stands for one who has reached the third of the four levels of awakening recognized in early Buddhism, i.e. an anāgāmin has become a &quot;non-returner&quot;, one who will not come back to be reborn again in the sensual world, but will reach final liberation in a higher heaven beyond the heavens of the sensual realm. In the early Buddhist scheme of four levels of awakening, which are defined by the stage by stage eradication of a set of ten fetters (saṃyojana) that binds unawakened worldlings to saṃsāra, a non-returner has eradicated the first five of such fetters: (1) the fetter of personality view; (2) the fetter of doubt; (3) the fetter of dogmatic clinging to rules and vows; (4) the fetter of sensual lust; and (5) the fetter of ill-will. In other words, a non-returner is beyond sensual attraction of any type and also will no longer react to anything with anger or aversion. The task that still lies ahead for the non-returner is the eradication of the remaining five fetters of (6) craving for fine-material states; (7) craving for immaterial states; (8) conceit; (9) restlessness; and (10) ignorance. Thus defined, a non-returner is still subject to more subtle types of attachment and has not yet completely eradicated ignorance.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:13373
maitreya|Sanskrit: Maitreya <Personal Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Maitreya:{byams pa/}, {byams pa'i bu/}\n\nMaitreya (Pāli: Metteyya) is also later called Ajita. Metteyya is mentioned only once in the early layers of the Pāli canon (Cakkavattisutta, PTS, vol. 3, pp. 75–76). According to some later Pāli sources (Mahāvaṃsa 32.72–75), Metteyya is one of the ten future Buddhas. In the non/pre-Tantric Mahāyāna sources such as the Bhadrakalpikasūtra (Weller 1928: 3; SWTF; Dhīḥ: vol. 25, p. 29; Nobel 1950: s.v. byams pa), Maitreya is regarded as the next and fifth Buddha (i.e. out of 1004 or 1005 Buddhas) of the fortunate aeon. Of the many future Buddhas, Maitreya is without doubt by far the most prominent one. His cult extended over virtually all regions in which Buddhism flourished. In both Tantric and non-Tantric Mahāyāna sources, Maitreya often belongs to a set of eight bodhisattva-s as in the Niṣpannayogāvalī and Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa. This set of eight is called “eight great close sons” (nye ba’i sras chen brgyad) in the Tibetan tradition (Tshig mdzod chen mo: s.v. rje btsun byams pa). Occasionally, he is also regarded as belonging to a set of ten bodhisattva-s (e.g. in the Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa); and of sixteen bodhisattva-s (e.g. in the Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa). Maitreya also occurs as a Buddhist Tantric deity in a number maṇḍala-s such as the 53-deity Vajradhātumaṇḍala (Mori 2001:  267), 43-deity Mañjuvajramaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 265), and 37-deity Durgatipariśodhanamaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 254). According to the Gūḍhapadā, Maitreya has to be visualized together with the fifteen other bodhisattva-s on the first of the four bands (paṭṭikā) of the bodhicittavajramaṇḍala (cf. occurrences below). In the Guhyasamājatantra (including the Samājottara) he is listed as the first of the eight mahābodhisattva-s. In chapter 17 of this tantra he is one of the interlocutors with all the Tathāgata-s (sarvatathāgata), who explain to him how the vajrācārya “should be seen”, i.e. conceived, by Buddha-s and bodhisattva-s (cf. prose passage after st. 51, ed. Matsunaga pp. 104–105). In the abhiṣeka section of his Ācāryakriyāsamuccaya, Darpaṇācārya (a.k.a. Jagaddarpaṇa) lists Maitreya as one of the nine bodhisattva-s that constitute the saṅghamaṇḍala, the third of the three maṇḍala-s (the other two being the buddhamaṇḍala and the dharmamaṇḍala) that have to be made by the practitioner after making offerings at the beginning of the ritual (see occurrences below). A very brief description of Maitreya can be found in the Vajrāmṛtamahātantrarājaṭīkā by Śrībhānu, where, in the commentary on Vajrāmṛtatantra\n 6.9, Maitreya is listed as the first of eight bodhisattva-s: he is yellow/golden-coloured, and with his hands makes the varadamudrā and bears a garland of flowers (D 1651, vol. Ra, fol. 87b3–4). A slightly more detailed description of Maitreya is given in the Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa (ed. Vaidya, p. 43). Here is the only bodhisattva who is close to the Bhagavān, whereas the other seven (here too called mahābodhisattva-s) are located on his right side. Among other things, Maitreya is said to be wearing the dress of a brahmacārin, twisted hair, and a crown; he is gold-coloured, his (lower and upper) garment is red, he has three lines on the forehead; in his left hand he bears a jar with a handle; in his right hand he bears a rosary. A mantra of Maitreya (oṃ maitrīyaharaṇāya [read: maitreyaspharaṇāya?] svāhā) and a mudrā connected with him (i.e. his visualization) are given in the Sarvadurgatipariśodhanatantra (see Skorupski, 1983, transl. pp. 9, 23; text pp. 129, 154). In this tantra, Maitreya is the first of a list of 16 bodhisattva-s (the list overlaps only in part with the one that we find for instance in Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa, p. 28). As is to be expected, Maitreya is praised as the eighth in hymns dedicated to the seven Buddhas: Vipaśyin, Śikhin, etc. (cf. Saptajinastava, st. 8, and Saptabuddhastotra, stt. 8–9; see Pandeya 1994: 248, 250).\nAccording to the traditional view, the high-ranking bodhisattva and next Buddha, Maitreya, is the author of several seminal works, in particular Yogācāra treatises. Only in modern scholarly literature is it sometimes supposed that there was a historical Yogācāra author bearing the name Maitreya(nātha), who later was confused with his celestial namesake. Both the Tibetan and the Chinese tradition commonly ascribe a pentad of texts to Maitreya. However, except for the (Mahāyāna)sūtrālaṃkāra and the Madhyāntavibhāga, different texts are listed (BBK3: 318; Sakuma 2013: 334).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:16170

See also Utpalāvarṇā.\nAccording to the Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya sources, Utpalavarṇā was the only daughter of a householder from Takṣaśilā. After a series of unhappy marriages and love-affairs, she became a nun and attained Arhatship (pp.159–160). Once she chased out 500 bandits by manifesting her magical prowess (ṛddhi) (p. 140). On another occasion as the Buddha returned from the celestial realm, Utpalavarṇā manifested herself as a cakravartin and greeted the Buddha. Udāyin detected her real identity by her scent. The Buddha, however, admonished her not to demonstrate her magical prowess in the presence of a buddha (pp. 192–193).  Utpalavarṇā was killed by Devadatta. Because he  was not granted access to the palace of Ajātaśatru, Devadatta became furious. He hit Utpalavarṇā on the head who was just coming out of the palace. He, ignoring her plea for her life, beat her to death (p. 123).\nAccording to the Pāli sources, Utpalavarṇā was born in Śrāvastī. She is considered one of the two chief female disciples of the Buddha, the other being Kṣemā.

In addition, two intermediary forms have also been distinguished, namely, belles-lettres that is also scientific (śāstrakāvya) and scientific work that is also belles-lettres (kāvyaśāstra). Furthermore, kāvya is divided into belles-lettres that is audible (śrāvya) and belles-lettres that is visible (dṛśya/prekṣya), i.e. drama. Śrāvya, in its turn, is further divided into metrical belles-lettres (padya: tshigs su bcad pa = tshigs bcad), prose (gadya: tshig lhug pa = lhug pa), and a mixed form (miśra: spel ma = bcad lhug spel ma), i.e. campū.

Śikṣ 178.14 above); Śikṣ 171.4 āpatti-kaukṛtya-sthānaṃ viśodhayituṃ, perhaps to wipe away any occasion for remorse due to sin (but Bendall and Rouse state of sin and wickedness, taking kaukṛtya etymologically; the Tib. is not cited); Laṅk 139.(13-)14,15 (yasya kasyacid anyasyānantaryakāriṇaḥ) kaukṛtyaṃ, tasya kaukṛtyadṛṣṭivinivartanārthaṃ nikṣiptadhurasya kaukṛtyadṛṣṭyabhāvārtham (Suzuki wickedness; but remorse, troubles of mind or conscience would seem preferable); Sādh 17.11 kaukṛtyam ājīvamalaṃ ratiṃ saṃgaṇikāsu ca (here wickedness seems more likely than in any other passage, but even here the word may mean only something like mental perturbation; note association with vicikitsā, kāṅkṣā, above; Chinese translations sometimes are said to render kau° by doubt, e. g. acc. to Finot on Prāt 518.3; so perhaps understand SP 71.4, above).\nTogether with auddhatya, kaukṛtya is the 56th of the 57 “flaws designated as ‘minor matter’” (doṣāḥ …kṣudravastukasaṃjñitāḥ) listed and explained in the Ratnāvalī ascribed to Nāgārjuna by the tradition and communis opinio.\nn.

rudra|Sanskrit: Rudra <Personal Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Rudra:{drag po/}\n\n‘Roarer or Howler,’  name of the god of tempests and father and ruler of the Rudras and Maruts (in the Veda he is closely connected with indra and still more with Agni, the god of fire, which, as a destroying agent, rages and crackles like the roaring storm, and also with kāla or Time the all-consumer, with whom he is afterwards identified ; though generally represented as a destroying deity, whose terrible shafts bring death or disease on men and cattle, he has also the epithet śiva, ‘benevolent’ or ‘auspicious,’ and is even supposed to possess healing powers from his chasing away vapours and purifying the atmosphere; in the later mythology the word Śiva, which does not occur as a name in the Veda, was employed, first as an euphemistic epithet and then as a real name for Rudra, who lost his special connection with storms and developed into a form of the disintegrating and reintegrating principle; while a new class of beings, described as eleven [or thirty-three] in number, though still called Rudras, took the place of the original Rudras or Maruts: in Viṣṇupurāṇa 1.7, Rudra is said to have sprung from Brahmā’s forehead, and to have afterwards separated himself into a figure half male and half female, the former portion separating again into the 11 Rudras, hence these later rudras are sometimes regarded as inferior manifestations of Śiva, and most of their names, which are variously given in the different Purāṇas, are also names of Śiva; those of the Yāyupurāṇa are Ajaikapād, Ahirbudhnya, Hara, Nirṛta, Īśvara, Bhuvana, Aṅgāraka, Ardhaketu, Mṛtyu, Sarpa, Kapālin; according  to others the Rudras are represented as children of Kaśyapa and Surabhi or of Brahmā and Surabhi or of Bhūta and Surūpā; according to Yāyupurāṇa i.8, Rudra is one of the 8 forms of Śiva; elsewhere he is reckoned among the Dikpālas as regent of the north-east quarter)\nOne of the deities of the Kālacakramaṇḍala in the Vajrāvalī.\nA myth of the submission and conversion of Rudra/Maheśvara plays an important role in esoteric Buddhism; see, e.g.,\nThe converted, Buddhicized, Rudra/(Śiva/Bhairava) is sometimes named Vajrarudra; see\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:29408

umA|Sanskrit: Umā <Personal Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Umā:{dka' zlog/}, {dka' bzlog ma/}, {u ma/}, {drag mo/}, {dka' thub bzlog ma/}\n\nUmā, the daughter of Himavat and consort of Śiva, also called Pārvatī and Durgā, is regarded as a worldly deity (laukikadevatā: ’jig rten pa’i lha), for instance, in the Mahāvyutpatti (under no. 3114). The name is said to be derived from u mā. See Kālidāsa’s Kumārasambhava cited below. See also MW: “O [child], do not [practise austerities]” the exclamation addressed to Pārvatī by her mother).” Later in Vajrayāna, she assumes the role of a Tantric deity, for examples, in the 34-deity Bhūtaḍāmaramaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 252) and in the 6th chapter of the Vajrāmṛtatantra. The narrative of the subjugation of Umā  and Maheśvara by Trailokyavijaya is found in the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha (§§ 707–733) and discussed in detail by Nobumi Iyanaga.\nIt may not be obvious why Tibetan translators rendered the name Umā as dKa’ bzlog, bKa’ zlog, or dKa’ bzlog ma. But if we consider the explanation of the name found, for example, in MW (see above)—“Oh, do not (practice austerities)!”—it becomes clear that Tibetan translators presupposed such a para-etymology. The name dKa’ bzlog ma may thus be understood as “One who was barred/prevented from the practice of austerities (dka’ thub: tapas) [by her mother].” Johannes Schneider (Schneider 1993: 308, 89) was unsure of the Sanskrit behind the Tibetan dKa’ bzlog ma, even though he cites an explanation of the name found in the Devātiśayastotraṭīkā (Schneider 1993: 89, n. 4): dka’ bzlog ni dka’ thub bzlog pa ste / lha mo u ma’o //. Schneider suggests (with a question mark) that dKa’ bzlog ma could be a rendering of Durgā. The Tibetan translation of the name Umā is actually recorded in the Mahāvyutpatti but Schneider does not refer to it. The name Durgā has been translated into Tibetan as dGrod dka’ ma and Durgādevī as rDzong gi lha mo.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:29617

Apte (1957) records a wide range of meanings of the word, namely, “covering; screening; exclusion, separation; not being found in, absence from; surrounding; rolling backwards; praise, eulogium; recurrence, repetition.” The meaning “praise, eulogium” is not recorded in PWK; MW: “praise, eulogium (?).” According to MW, the meaning “screening” (omitted in PWK) is probably for vyāvṛti.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:36584

But the words vīta and āvīta can also refer to the logical reason (hetu), probably because it is the most important part of a proof.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:36930

The term mudrā literally means ‘seal,’ ‘stamp’ or the ‘impression or mark left by a seal,’ and thus also ‘image,’ ‘sign,’ or ‘token.’ In the context of religious rituals, prescribed gestures often accompany mantras, and thereby function as a support for the mantric power or as a guarantee of their efficacy. These mudrā-s or gestures may have their origin in mnemonic techniques employed by reciters of the Veda, and so readily serve as a means of evoking an idea in the mind as well as symbolizing various things, such as certain powers or deities. The term mudrā, like vidyā (rig ma), is also used with reference to the female partner of a deity or a practitioner.\nmudrā – nirukti given in the Mitapadā Pañjikā of Durjayacandra (ad 2.4.101): modyate pramodyate yogī yoginī vānayeti mudrā /.

Therefore, even its lexical attestation is doubtful. At any rate, it is completely unclear how to explain the first member of this compound.

paJcakrama|Sanskrit: Pañcakrama <Scripture/Treatise>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Pañcakrama:{rim pa lnga pa/}\n\nA niṣpannakrama treatise of the Guhyasamāja Ārya School. As the title indicates, the system of Tantric meditation expounded in this text consists of five krama-s or “steps.”\nThe five “steps” of the Pañcakrama are: 1. Vajrajāpakrama, 2. Sarvaśuddhiviśuddhikrama (alias Anuttarasandhi), 3. Svādhiṣṭhānakrama, 4. Paramarahasyasukhābhisambodhikrama, and\n 5. Yuganaddhakrama. However, some commentators of the Pañcakrama exclude the Sarvaśuddhiviśuddhikrama from the five and count the Piṇḍīkrama as the first step. A detailed discussion of the textual composition of the Pañcakrama is found in Tomabechi 2006.\nThere is another well-known Tantric treatise called the Pañcakrama ascribed to Ghaṇṭāpāda. This latter text, the  “Ghaṇṭāpādīya-Pañcakrama” or  “Pañcakramopadeśa,” belongs to the Cakrasaṃvara cycle and consists of five chapters, i.e., 1. Adhiṣṭhānakrama, 2. Nānāprakāraviśvavajrakrama, 3. Maṇipūrakrama, 4. Jālandharakrama, and\n 5. Acintyopamoḍiyānakrama.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:67909

devAnAmpriya|Sanskrit: devānāmpriya <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of devānāmpriya:{lha rnams dga' ba/}, {lha rnams dga' bar byed pa/}\n\nEnglish: “beloved of the gods,” simple, foolish, a fool, idiot like a brute beast\nAccording to Yaśomitra’s explanation of Vasubandhu’s mention of Patañjali’s expression, devānāmpriya can be understood in two ways: for some, he is a “man of straight character” (“homme de nature droite”, ṛjukajātīya), for such a man is loved by the gods. For others, he is a stupid person, for a man favoured by kings (deva being glossed by īśvara) does not undergo a strict training. La Vallée Poussin mentions other passages cited by the Japanese editor of the Kośa in which the understanding “stupid person” (“sot”) is adopted for devānāmpriya, but also gives two other explanations, namely, (i) the term designates somebody who is rich, but is applied ironically to poor people; (ii) the term should be interpreted as a karmadhāraya, and deva as a stupid person; the compound thus designates someone who loves stupid persons, i.e., is himself stupid. According to La Vallée Poussin, in Patañjali’s time it was a royal title that tended to be used ironically, as in Patañjali’s dialogue between the coachman and the grammarian.\nConsidered by Kātyāyana to constitute an exception to Pāṇini’s rule (vi.3.ii) according to which a compound whose first term is in the genitive is unacceptable. Title of Indian kings at the time of the Mauryas. Since Patañjali, found only in controversies where one of the debaters addresses his opponent in the third person and in the works of grammarians that explain Patañjali. Kayata, followed by the Siddhāntakaumudī (vi.3.11), explains deva as mūrkha (idiot), and hence devānāmpriya as “idiot” (the idiots are the ones loved by the idiots).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:70619

hayagrIva|Sanskrit: Hayagrīva <Personal Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Hayagrīva:{rta mgrin/}\n\nHayagrīva, who is regarded as manifestation of Avalokiteśvara therefore belonging to the Lotus family, is one of the wrathful deities (krodha) in the 19-deity maṇḍala of the Jñānapāda school (Tanaka 1997) as well as in the 32-deity maṇḍala of the Ārya school  (Luo & Tomabechi 2009: pp. xxxii–xxxiii) of the Guhyasamāja tradition. He also appears as one of the 43-deity Mañjuvajramaṇḍala (Mori 2001: p. 264) and in the 66-deity Ṣaṭcakravartimaṇḍala described in the Vajrāvalī (Mori 2001: p. 246). Hayagrīva’s location in the maṇḍala and position with regard to other krodharāja-s vary according to the context and the Tantric system. Usually he has to be visualized in his wrathful appearance, sometimes in connection with Bhṛkuṭī (especially in the sādhana-s of Khasarpaṇa and Padmanarteśvara, two forms of Avalokiteśvara), other times in connection with Yamāntaka, Aparājita and Amṛtakuṇḍali (see occurrences below). While Hayagrīva makes part of the pantheon of the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha (where in chapters 16, 18b we also find mantra-s connected with him), of the Guhyasamājatantra and of the Kṛṣṇayamāritantra, he is totally absent in other influential Tantric sources such as the Hevajratantra (see occurrences below). According to some sources, Hayagrīva has to be visualized by the practitioner on his mouth (see occurrences below). Hayagrīva is mentioned and occasionally described in seven of the sādhana-s published in the Sādhanamālā collection (Sādhanamālā: nos. 13–15, 18, 24, 26, 32).\nHayagrīva, n. of a deity, assoc. with Bhṛkuṭī: Sādh 37.10 et alibi.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:87491

He aided Pa tshab nyi ma grags (b. 1055?) in translating Candrakīrti’s Catuḥśatakaṭīkā. His grandfather Ratnavajra was one of the six gatekeepers (mkhas pa sgo drug) of Vikramaśīla monastery, on which one of the earliest sources is the Chos ’byung me tog snying po’i sbrang rtsi’i bcud of Nyang ral Nyi ma’i ’od zer (ca. 1124–1192), and the next earliest is probably the Zhib mo rdo rje by dMar ston Chos kyi rgyal po (ca. 1198–1259). According to Tāranātha, Ratnavajra was originally from Kashmir, and after his long sojourn in east India, he returned to Kashmir.\nSajjana collaborated in  the Tibetan translations of the Ratnagotravibhāga and its verse version (P 5525, 5526; D 4024, 4025) and in the revision of  the Tibetan translation of the Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra (P 5521, D 4020).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:94178

abhayAkaragupta|Sanskrit: Abhayākaragupta <Personal Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Abhayākaragupta:{'jigs med 'byung gnas sbas pa/}\n\nThe Vikramaśīla monastery was the central monastery of Tantric Buddhism in India during this period, and it seems certain that Abhaya’s work reflects the routine style of the rituals of his time. Furthermore, Abhaya himself has been highly esteemed as the most distinguished Buddhist scholar of the final period of Indian Buddhism, which vanished from that country approximately one century after his death. Indian Tantric Buddhism was thus rapidly approaching its culmination during the period of Abhaya’s lifetime … Tāranātha provides some information about Abhaya in his Chos ’byung. According to this source, King Rāmapāla just after his enthronement invited Abhaya to become abbot of the Buddhagayā monastery. Then the King appointed him as abbot of the Vikramaśīla and Nālandā monasteries. In Tāranātha’s opinion, Abhaya was the last distinguished scholar in the history of Indian Buddhism. He suggests that Abhaya’s works should be esteemed more highly than the works of all other masters (ācārya) belonging to the period subsequent to the Six Jewels of the Vikramaśīla monastery who flourished in the first half of the 11th century. The Six Jewels of the Vikramaśīla monastery are Ratnākaraśānti, Prajñākaramati, Vāgīśvarakīrti, Nāropa, Ratnavajra, Jñānaśrīmitra. The names of some direct disciples of Abhaya are mentioned by Tāranātha: Śubhakarasena, Raviśrījñāna, Nāyakaśrī, Daśabalaśrī, Dharmākaraśānti, Viyaśodeva, Niṣkalaṅkadeva, Dharmākaragupta and others. Śākyaśrībhadra, the great paṇḍita from Kashmir, is listed in the next generation. According to Tāranātha, Abhaya passed away a few years before King Rāmapāla’s abdication, which took place ca. 1125. Thus we can place the approximate date of Abhaya in the final decades of the 11th century and the first quarter of the 12th century.\nAn encyclopedic author active during the reign of Rāmapāla (ca. 1084–1126 / 1077–ca. 1119) of the Pāla Dynasty, Abhayākaragupta is renowned for his erudition that covers a vast range of subjects in Buddhism.  His expertise is especially prominent in, though not limited to, the area of Tantric Buddhism, as attested by the well-known “Garland Trilogy” (phreng ba skor gsum), i.e. his three major works on Tantric ritual (Vajrāvalī, Jyotirmañjarī and Niṣpannayogāvalī), that exercised a great influence on the Buddhism of later period in Nepal and Tibet. \nThe Peking Tanjur includes twenty-six works ascribed to Abhayākaragupta, of which twenty-three are in the domain of Tantra; the other three deal with non-Tantric Buddhism.  Though most of these works are only available through Tibetan translation, some important texts of Abhayākaragupta are preserved in Sanskrit. The following works in Sanskrit have hitherto been edited: Niṣpannayogāvalī; Vajrāvalī; Jyotirmañjarī; Ucchuṣmajambhalasādhana; Svādhiṣṭhānakramopadeśa.  In addition, Sanskrit manuscripts are known to exist of the Pañcakramatātparyapañjikā Kramakaumudī, Kālacakrāvatāra, Abhayapaddhati.  According to some recent information, furthermore, Sanskrit manuscripts of the Āmnāyamañjarī, Munimatālaṅkāra and Madhyamakamañjarī  have been discovered in Tibet.\nAbhayākaragupta was among the last great masters of Buddhism in India. Active at the famous monastery of Vikramaśīla during the reign of Rāma Pāla (c. 1100), he wrote prolifically on most major areas of Buddhist practice and thought: Mahāyāna doctrine and the path, and Tantric ritual and meditation are all encyclopedically represented in the writings that survive. Through both his impact on Tibetan visitors to Vikramaśīla, and the continuing activity of his successors in connection with the transmission of Indian traditions to Tibet, he came also to exert a remarkable influence upon the formation of Tibetan Buddhism, particularly during the twelfth through fourteenth centuries. Nevertheless, because his works have received little attention in contemporary scholarship, his importance as an exemplar of Buddhism under the Pāla dynasty as well as his legacy in Tibet have remained largely unknown.\nAbhayākaragupta (late eleventh to early twelfth century), a contemporary of king Rāmapāla, is the last great scholar in the last phase of the history of Indian Buddhism. Twenty four works belonging to different sections of bsTan ’gyur are attributed to him. The Abhayapaddhati (henceforth AP), an extensive commentary on the Buddhakapālatantra, is one of the two commentaries on esoteric scriptural texts written by him, the other one being the Āmnāyamañjarī, an encyclopedic commentary on the Saṃpuṭatantra. Most likely, AP was written during the period of 1096–1108, when Abhayākaragupta also began to compose the Vajrāvalī.\nAbhayākaragupta flourished about 1100 and was a scholar of the Vikramaśīlā (sic) monastic seminary. There, in the thirtieth year of the reign of King Rāmapāla (rg. c. 1077–1130 or 1072–1126), he composed the Munimatālaṃkāra. This very extensive treatise of encyclopaedic character expounds Mahāyānist gnoseology and soteriology in connexion with the Prajñāpāramitā doctrine and includes many references to the basic texts of both the Madhyamaka and Yogācāra/Vijñānavāda schools.\nThe chronological tables (re’u mig) on the history of Tibet by Sum pa mkhan po Ye śes dpal ’byor give his birth year as the Wood-Dragon year (śiṅ ’brug) and his year of death as the Wood-Serpent year (śiṅ sbrul), corresponding to 1064 and 1125. Ye śes dpal ’byor assigns the same Wood-Dragon year as birth year to ’Brom ston and Glan tshul byaṅ of rGyal, but in their cases the Wood-Dragon year in the earlier sixty year cycle, i.e. 1004 is appropriate.\n\nWe know from Tibetan sources that Abhayākara was a contemporary of King Rāmapāla. Moreover, the colophons of his works state that they were written during specific years of Rāmapāla’s reign. The works and their dates are\n1. the Abhayapaddhati, composed during the twenty-fifth year,\n2. the Munimatālaṃkāra, composed during the thirtieth year,\n3. and the Āmnāyamañjarī, completed during the thirty-seventh year.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:96356

vidyAsthAna|Sanskrit: vidyāsthāna <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of vidyāsthāna:{rig pa'i gnas/}\n\nEnglish: branch of knowledge, field of knowledge, discipline of knowledge\nAccording to Vincent Eltschinger, the five vidyāsthāna’s “inclusion in the curriculum of a bodhisattva is not meant, at least not primarily, in a spirit of liberal academic learning, but has an unambiguously apologetic and proselytizing intention. This is true of ‘internal science’ (adhyātmavidyā), viz. Buddhist dogmatics-cum-soteriology, of medicine (cikitsāvidyā) and arts-and-crafts (śilpakarmasthānavidyā, since helping or pleasing others in various ways disposes them favourably to Buddhism), but also of linguistics/grammar (śabdavidyā) and logic/dialectics (hetuvidyā), the two disciplines meant to defeat opponents (paranigraha).”\nIn the Bodhisattvabhūmi, five branches of knowledge are supposed to be investigated or strived after (paryeṣate) by a bodhisattva.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:98003
jAti|Sanskrit: jāti <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of jāti:{rigs/}\n\nEnglish: universal\nAccording to Halbfass, the term jāti originated in Naiyāyika philosophy. It is not wholly exchangeable with sāmānya, another term for universal not much used in the earliest Nyāya writings. The term jāti is usually considered there narrower in scope than sāmānya, and as applying to something akin to natural species. In the time of “classical Nyāya the uses of jāti and sāmānya tend to coincide” (Halbfass 1992: 121).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:98787
trairUpya|Sanskrit: trairūpya <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of trairūpya:{tshul gsum pa nyid/}, {ngo bo gsum/}, {gsum gyi bdag nyid/}\n\nLiterally, trairūpya simply means “being of three forms/natures”.  The term is often used by Buddhist logicians to define criteria for the validity of a reason-property (liṅga) in an inference.  In this usage, it restricts the reason-property in three ways: first, it has to be present in the instance that the inference is about; second, it has to be present in a case similar to the one that the inference is about; and, third, it must not be present in dissimilar cases.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:98791

sAmAnyalakSaNa|Sanskrit: sāmānyalakṣaṇa <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of sāmānyalakṣaṇa:{spyi'i mtshan nyid/}\n\nEnglish: universal, common characteristic\nThe two terms svalakṣaṇa (particular) and sāmānyalakṣaṇa (universal) play a central role in the Buddhist logico-epistemological school initiated by Dignāga.  They are closely tied to both the epistemological and ontological theories that define this school.  Ontologically, the particular is what is real, with reality defined as being capable of producing an effect.  This implies, at least since Dharmakīrti, that any particular must be momentary.  Its momentariness, furthermore, implies that it is spatially and temporally unique.  This commits this group of Buddhists to the position that the common objects of everyday experience are just a continuum (santāna) of moments in a causal nexus with each other.  \n\nThe universal is defined as what is other than a particular, and, hence, what does not exist in reality as defined above.  A universal is whatever is experienced (by unawakened beings) as persisting throughout time.  This category includes all the objects of normal experience, as well as anything that causes a cognition of things as the same (a central point of contention in the philosophical debate with the realist schools of India). \n\nEpistemologically, the particular and the universal are aligned with the two sources of knowledge accepted by these Buddhists: perception takes a particular as its object, and inference a universal.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:101484

The examples Dignāga mentions in his Pramāṇasamuccaya are kṛtakatva and śrāvaṇatva. While the former is presented by Vaiśeṣika (with pot as a similar instance) for proving the impermanence of sound, ‘audibility’ (śrāvaṇatva) is given (with ‘condition/nature of being sound’ (śabdatva) as similar instance) by Mīmāṃsaka for proving the permanence of sound.\nDignāga classifies viruddhāvyabhicārin as one of the fallacious reasons called anaikāntikahetu, which would be ‘cause of doubt’ (saṃśayahetu). According to Dharmakīrti, however, the fallacy of viruddhāvyabhicārin “could arise when one of the disputants relied on an inference which was simply based on his scriptures (āgamāśritānumāna),” but not in the case of an inference caused by the force of [real] entities (vastubalapravṛttānumāna), and hence it should not be enumerated as a kind of fallacious logical reason.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:101497

However, in primary literature the more common expression for the three Buddha Bodies outside of larger compounds seems to be kāyatraya. For a possible instance of the use of trikāya as an independent word with the meaning “three bodies,” one may refer, e.g., to Saṃvarodayatantra IV.23 (see below).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:101922

According to Sanderson, Pratyaṅgirā is a “Tantric personification of Atharvavedic counter-sorcery (pratyaṅgirasam).” In the Buddhist Tantric context, Pratyaṅgirā is associated with the pañcarakṣā, a group of goddesses referred to as the Five Protectresses, regarded as deifications of particular protective mantras or vidyās, occasionally also of protective amulets.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:102841

In its developed form, the saṃpuṭoghāta ritual is characterized by a rather involved structure. Descriptions in primary sources—though there are few—show a considerable amount of diversity as regards the actual ritual procedure, and accentuate the need for authorisation. The saṃpuṭoghāṭa is listed among the  Esoteric Ten Fundamentals (*guhyadaśatattva) to be mastered by a Tantric officiant of the Higher Tantras (see, for instance, the respective list in the Vajrahṛdayālaṃkāratantra). In the daśatattva lists given by Vimalakīrti and Ḍombī, applying the divergent technical terminology of the Ḍakinīvajrapañjaratantra, the corresponding ritual is referred to as *bheda (Tib. dgar). Kāṇha explains saṃpuṭodghāṭa as the unlocking, i.e. separating, of consciousness and body, vijñānaśarīrayor udghāṭaḥ pṛthakkaraṇam (Yogaratnamālā ad Hevajratantra II.ix.1).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:102895

First, vajraḍākinī is used as a generic term for a certain class of Buddhist Tantric female deities or practitioners. Second, Vajraḍākinī is a name borne by several female deities in specific maṇḍala-s such as Sampuṭatantroktavajrasattvamaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 297), Jñānaḍākinīmaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 295), Hevajramaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 294), Nairātmyāmaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 292), Kurukullāmaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 281, 289), and Mahāmāyāmaṇḍala (Mori 2001: 285). Third, in the  Cakrasaṃvara context, Vajraḍākinī is often an appellation of Vajrayoginī/Vajravārāhī, the principal female deity of the system, in particular.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:103772
jJAnAmRta|Sanskrit: jñānāmṛta <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of jñānāmṛta:{ye shes bdud rtsi/}\n\nEnglish: ambrosia of knowledge\nIn Buddhist Tantrism, the term jñānāmṛta has different values: first of all, it occurs as one of the two subcategories of sevā (besides vajracatuṣka, see also s.v. sevā and s.v. vajracatuṣka) as distinguished in Guhyasamājatantra xviii. In this context, it is an alternative term for ṣaḍaṅgayoga (see respective quotation below). In descriptions of the insight-gnosis initiation, the semen (bodhicitta) is said to be imagined as gnosis nectar. Moreover, in a less specific sense, it is occasionally applied to the five nectars (pañcāmṛta). It can also refer to a nectar that is visualized as drawn from the hearts of the Buddhas in all directions, embodying the five Buddha gnoses, which is mixed with the five nectars and made homogenous with them.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:104273

First, it is used non-technically or non-terminologically in the sense of the generation of any kind of thought. It is perhaps in this sense that the word is used in non/pre-Mahāyāna sources. Second, in the Mahāyāna sources, it appears to be used mainly in the technical sense of bodhicittotpāda (“generation of the resolve to [attain the highest state of] awakening”).

There is a remote possibility that Atri has been associated with Agni, who is known in Vedic literature both as ‘omnivorous’ (viśvād RV. VIII 44.26 etc.) and as ‘omniscient’ (viśvavedas RV.

vArANasI|Sanskrit: Vārāṇasī <Place Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Vārāṇasī:{wā rā ṇa sī/}, {khor mo 'jig/}, {khor mor 'jig/}, {bā rā ṇa sī/}, {g.yog 'dor/}\n\nthe city Benares (more properly written Banaras; … so called after the names of two rivers, Varaṇā and Asi, or Asī; also written Vāṇārasī q.v., Varāṇasī or Vāraṇasī)\nVārāṇasī (’Khor mor ’jig) has been mentioned in Buddhist sources (e.g. both in the Pāli Mahāparinibbānasutta and the Sanskrit Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra) as one of the six great cities of India where the Buddha was active (Roth 2004: 123). According to dGe ’dun chos ’phel, it is the place where the Buddha set the Wheel of Dharma into motion for the first time, one of the “four great sacred places [connected with the life] of the Buddha” (sangs rgyas kyi gnas chen po bzhi), or, one of the “eight great sacred places [connected with the life of the Buddha]” (gnas chen brgyad).\nBenares. This is at present situated at the confluence of the rivers Vāraṇā and Asi, but formerly  at the confluence of the Ganges and Gomati (gaṅgāyā uttare kule vaprānte rājasattama / gomatyā dakṣiṇe kule śakrasyevāmarāvatīm // Mb. 13.30.18). It was the capital of Kāśī, and seat of a Brahmanical University.\nWith regard to the Tibetan interpretation of the name Vārāṇasī, Michael Hahn states: “A noteworthy case is khor mo(r) ’jig and wā rā ṇa sī for Vārāṇasī, which in the first case was analyzed as consisting of vāra “turn” and the derivation of the root naś “to perish.” In connection with this explanation of the Tibetan translation of Vārāṇasī, it should be perhaps made clear that ’khor/khor mor was obviously understood adverbially, that is, in the sense of vāraṃ vāram or vāraṃ vāreṇa, “many times, often, repeatedly” (MW, s.v. vāra). Thus ’khor mor ’jig would mean something like “that which disintegrates repeatedly/continually.” The Tibetan translation of the Vajratuṇḍasamayakalparāja (B, vol. 96, p. 96.3) (the Sanskrit original is currently being studied by Gergely Hidas) has g.yog ’dor (sNar thang is reported to read ’khar instead of ’dor) as the rendering of Vārāṇasī. Péter Szántó (oral communication) surmises that g.yog here may be an interpretation of vāra in the sense of parivāra, and ’dor seems to be a rendering of √as (“to throw, cast”, see MW, s.v. 2). See comments in Waddell 1914: 41, n. 32, where g.yog ’dor is understood literally as “servant thrown off or forsaken or striding.” Since the Sanskrit text of the Vajratuṇḍasamayakalparāja has Vārāṇasī, the reconstruction (i.e. urana+dāsa) suggested by Waddell turns out to be wrong.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:34596

It is obvious that ’chang is a rendering of √dhā in the sense of “holding” or “possessing” (MW, s.v. dha). But it is not obvious how one can account for the rendering dbus ’gyur. A conceivable possibility is that Tibetan translators interpreted maga as an abbreviation of madhyaga “going or being in the middle or among (with gen. or ifc.)” (MW). That is, Magadhā was understood as “that which holds what happens to be in the middle.” A similar explanation has been offered by Si tu paṇ chen, an English translation of which has been given by Verhagen.   \n\nMichael Hahn convincingly proposed that mNyam dka’ is a Tibetan rendering of the name Magadha, but he did not speculate about the possible Tibetan interpretation of the name. He did, however, “assume that the explanation of the peculiar translation of Magadha by mnyam dka’ might be hidden in a Buddhist dogmatic work or commentary, perhaps surviving in one of the commentaries on a Sanskrit lexicon.”\nThe Tibetan translators who rendered Magadha as Bying ’dzin seem to have connected the component maga with the  root majj, “to sink” (MW).\n\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:34679

bali|Sanskrit: bali <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of bali:{gtor ma/}\n\nEnglish: propitiatory food offering, the ritual of making propitiatory food offerings\nIn the context of Tantric Buddhism, bali is one of the fifty rituals taught by Abhayākaragupta in the Vajrāvalī.\nIn Tantric Buddhist literature, bali is listed among the Ten Fundamentals (daśatattva).\nThe term bali as a designation for a food offering can be traced back to Vedic sources; it may be regarded as a sort of ritual universal applied in various religious contexts. The etymology of the word is uncertain. The word bali has been used for profane offerings such as taxes, as well as for offerings to various classes of supernatural beings such as yakṣa-s, bhūta-s, nāga-s and deva-s. In Tantric Buddhist literary sources, the bali ritual is frequently depicted as a subsidiary rite supposed to ensure the smooth and successful realisation of the main ritual.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:35793

Moreover, tadyathā is also several times used in that chapter with the function to introduce similes/analogies (tadyathā…evam eva).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:41827

KAlakarNI|Sanskrit: Kālakarṇī <Personal Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Kālakarṇī:{rna ba nag mo/}, {rna nag ma/}, {rna nag mo/}\n\nSome key points pertaining the headword may be summarized as follows: According to Monica Zin (2003), the grammatical gender of the word initially was feminine but it also came to be used in the masculine (see below). The word/name Kālakarṇī has several referents: (1) The word kālakarṇī,  as a common noun, is used in the sense of “misfortune,” “inauspiciousness,” or “penury.” (2) The deity Kālakarṇī, alias Alakṣmī/Kālī (not as Lakṣmī as von Böhtlingk has it), the antithesis of Śrī/Lakṣmī, the goddess of prosperity/auspiciousness, may be seen as the anthropomorphized or personified form of  “misfortune” or “inauspiciousness.” As Zin demonstrates in her study, the idea that Lakṣmī and Alakṣmī, Śrī and Kālī, are opposites which can never occur in the same locus can be traced to earlier Buddhist sources such as the Tesakuṇajātaka, Mahāummagajātaka, and Sirikālakaṇṇijātaka, and also is found in late Upaniṣadic sources such  as the Mahānārāyaṇopaniṣad and Nṛsiṃhapūrvatāpanīyopaniṣad (see below). (3) Kālakarṇī is also reported by von Böhtlingk to be the name of a yoginī, and a deity bearing this name is included in the Pañcarakṣāmaṇḍala, as described in, for example, Abhayākaragupta’s Vajrāvalī (Mori 2001: 269).  (4) In the Pāli sources (DPPN: vol. 1, pp. 574–575), there seem to be at least three figures bearing the name Kāḷakaṇṇī/Kāḷakaṇṇī, namely,  (a) a friend of Anāthapīṇḍika, (b) the treasurer’s friend in the story of the past given in the Kāḷakaṇṇījātaka, and (c) daughter of Virūpakkha (in the Sirikālakaṇṇījātaka), where she is also called Kāḷī and Alakkhī. (5) According to Śaiva sources, Kālakarṇī is the name of a type of Tantric mudrā. This usage presupposes the sense of Kālakarṇī as a deity. (6) The idea of coincidentia oppositorum of Kālakarṇī and Lakṣmī/Śrī can be found, for example, in the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya and Catuḥśatakaṭīkā and also in the Chinese translation of the Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra and its Tibetan translation.\nkālakarṇī f. — 1) dass. — 2) Bein. der Lakṣmī Ind.

The SvāSS (18.29) prescribes it to be shown at the recitation of the four Vidyāṅgas. The alternative form, kālakaṇṭhī, seems to have evolved as a misreading of kālakarṇī, but the corruption may have occurred the other way round; on a possibly similar confusion, cf. the terms kaṇṭha* and karṇa*.

On the importance of this there is widespread, if not universal, agreement; the precise nature of these two stages, and their relationship, however, are matters on which there appear to have been divergent views from an early period.\nThe expression sampannakrama ... though used with surprising frequency in secondary literature, is not to my knowledge attested in texts that are extant in Sanskrit.\nutpannakrama/niṣpannakrama ‘Stufe des Entstandenen/Vollendeten’ (oft mit ‘completion stage’, ‘Stufe der Vollendung’, oder ähnliches übersetzt); gemäß Ratnākaraśānti die Stufe oder Art von yoga worin der Yogin sich auf seine eigene, vollkommene Natur konzentriert.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:121510

It is the phase which for the first time eradicates Defilements (kleśa, ñon moṅs), or Obstacles (āvaraṇa, sgrib pa), though, it is true, not yet all of them. But even the further stages of (at least the Supramundane) Path largely consist in a kind of repetition of the darśanamārga. The latter may thus well be called the decisive stage of the Buddhist Path to Salvation.\nFor metrical reasons, dṛṅmārga and dṛkpatha are occasionally used instead of darśanamārga.\nAccording to both Mahāyāna and non/pre-Mahāyāna, upon attaining the darśanamārga one ceases to be an ordinary being (pṛthagjana) and becomes a Noble Being (ārya).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:122167

nirodha|Sanskrit: nirodha <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of nirodha:{ʼgag pa/}, {ʼgog pa/}\n\nEnglish: cessation\nThe word nirodha is very common in Sanskrit, but also has certain technical meanings in Buddhism. As the third Noble Truth (āryasatya), the term nirodha refers to the goal of soteriological practice, i.e. nirvāṇa, the cessation of all suffering or unsatisfactoriness (duḥkhanirodha).\n\nAccording to some Tibetan sources, the two types of nirodha, namely, pratisaṃkhyānirodha and apratisaṃkhyānirodha, which are by definition asamskṛtadharma-s, are counted among the seven elements that belong to the dharmadhātu (chos khams bdun), which are the objects of mental perception. This is in accordance with the Abhidharma (i.e. Sarvāstivāda) tradition that presupposes three asamskṛtadharma-s, the other four being vedanāskandha, saṃskāraskandha, saṃjñāskandha, and avijñaptirūpa. For the Abhidharmasamuccaya tradition, the two types of nirodha belong to the group of  sixteen  elements that make up the dharmadhātu (i.e. five kinds of special rūpa, vedanāskandha, saṃskāraskandha, saṃjñāskandha, and eight kinds of asamskṛtadharma-s which include the two types of nirodha).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:18466

maNDala|Sanskrit: maṇḍala <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of maṇḍala:{dkyil 'khor/}\n\nEnglish: a disk (esp. of the sun or moon); a circle, globe, ring, circumference, ball, wheel, a halo round the sun or moon, a multitude, group, band, collection, whole body, society, company, a district, arrondissement, territory, province, country, schematically arranged pantheon\nMaṇḍala, a geometrical design with cosmological resonances found in various Indian religious traditions, is an enclosure, not necessarily circular, which separates a sacred area from the profane world, and as such it represents the domain of a particular deity. Since the outer ring borders the profane world, the centre is thus the most sacred area. The maṇḍala depicts a celestial palace inhabited by a chief deity—or a symbol of it in the form of a syllable (bīja)—which is placed in the centre, with associated deities arranged around it in hierarchical order. … [T]he pattern exhibited by maṇḍalas may vary: it can be simple or elaborate, it can have a central figure or not, the central deity may be surrounded by other deities, individual gods may be accompanied by goddesses, and so forth. Nonetheless, in all cases, the maṇḍala provides an abode for the deity and safekeeping for its power.\nThe primary meaning of maṇḍala is “anything round” and can have a wide range of specific and technical meanings.\nmaṇḍala, dkyil ’khor – the Trailokyavijayavṛtti of Muditakoṣa 223a sees it as twofold - visionary and representational: spyir na dkyil ’khor yang rnam pa gnyis te / rang bzhin gyi dkyil ’khor sangs rgyas dang byang chub sems dpa’ ’khor dang bcas pa ji ltar bzhugs pa mngon du mthong ba’i dkyil ’khor ni gong du bshad pa rnams so // da ni mi la sogs pa rang bzhin gyi dkyil ’khor gyi gzugs brnyan ni ri mor bris te bstan par bya ba’i phyir …, and goes on to give four kinds with the note that all are contained in parts in all, but to make access easier they are entered gradually (223b). See mahāmaṇḍala, vajramaṇḍala, samayamaṇḍala, karmamaṇḍala. This twofold definition is perhaps based on Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha 1,110,203: athātaḥ saṃpravakṣyāmi mahāmaṇḍalam uttamam / vajradhātupratīkāśaṃ vajradhātur iti smṛtam//.

In the Buddhist context this notion is also used in the framework of the bodhisattva career to mark the anointment of the direct heir of the Buddha (see e.g. the passage from the Mahāvastu quoted below). The term can also be used metaphorically to refer to the salvific activity of the Buddha (see passage of the Milindapañha below), or to the Bodhisattva’s perfection of giving (dānapāramitā) (see the epigraphic verse from Andhra quoted below). In Tantric works, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist, this term is used referring to an adept who has been ‘initiated’ and then received the permission to practice according to the teachings of the system into which he has been initiated. This term occurs alone and also as a member of a compound; it is sometimes replaced (also due to metrical requirements) by periphrastic expressions like prāptābhiṣeka (e.g. in the Pañcakrama, Subhāṣitasaṃgraha, Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati, and Tantrāloka), abhiṣekaprāpta (e.g. the Samādhirājasūtra and Akṣayamatinirdeśa), labdhābhiṣeka (e.g. the Svayaṃbhūpurāṇa, Lalitavistara, and Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa), and abhiṣekalabdha (e.g. the Ratnagotravibhāga and Yogaratnamālā). Sometimes texts describe the advantages deriving from being ‘initiated’; these advantages consist in protection (see e.g. the passage from the Jñānasiddhi cited below) and recognition (see e.g. the passages from Vajrāmṛtatantra and Hevajratantrapiṇḍārthaṭīkā cited below).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:35309

jJAnapAda|Sanskrit: Jñānapāda <Personal Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Jñānapāda:{ye shes zhabs/}, {sangs rgyas ye shes zhabs/}\n\nJñānapāda is a Buddhist scholar and the founder of the more ancient of the two prevailing exegetical traditions relating to the Guhyasamājatantra. Prior to making his mark as a prolific Tantric exegete, he was a student of Haribhadra (see below).\nJñānapāda systematized the practice of two Stages (krama) and three Initiations (abhiṣeka), the sources for these being from the Yogottaratantra and Yoganiruttaratantra. The first of the two Stages is the “Stage of Arising (utpattikrama, bskyed rim)” and the second is the “Stage of the Completed/Perfected (utpanna- / niṣpanna- krama, rdzogs rim).”\nAmong Jñānapāda’s works, the Samantabhadrasādhana (Caturaṅgasādhana) teaches the Stage of Arising, on the other hand, the Muktitilaka is related to  the Stage of the Completed/Perfected. These works were translated into Tibetan by Kamalagupta and Tsa la na Ye shes rgyal mtshan. Kamalagupta worked with Rin chen bzang po after 996 and Tsa la na Ye shes rgyal mtshan translated many important works with him. These texts translated are associated with the Jñānapāda School, including most of *Vitapāda’s works. Rin chen bzang po translated many works of the same school, including the Samantabhadrasādhana, with his teacher Śraddhākaravarman. This imported work has also been translated by Smṛtijñānakīrti.\nIn the history of the Guhyasamāja in Tibet, we find that the introduction of the Jñānapāda School is associated with  Seven Branches, namely those of (1) Rin chen bzang po, (2) Smṛtijñānakīrti, (3) Atiśa, (4) gNyen Dar ma grags, (5) Rwa rDo rje grags, (6) gNyos Yon tan grags, and (7) Śākyaśrībhadra. Except for the branch of Smṛtijñānakīrti, these branches originated from the Vikramaśīla Monastery in East India.\n*Vitapāda, who is highly esteemed as one of the great disciples of Jñānapāda, tells us that Jñānapāda wrote 14 works related to the Guhyasamājatantra. Some of them are preserved in Tibetan Tripiṭaka, including his important work *Dvikramatattvabhāvanāmukhāgama.\nAccording to Tāranātha, the first in the succession of the “(Twelve Chief) Tantric Masters of Vikramaśīla [monastic seminary]” (rnam gnon tshul gyi sngags pa’i slob dpon).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:144366

svalakSaNa|Sanskrit: svalakṣaṇa <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of svalakṣaṇa:{rang gi mtshan nyid/}\n\nEnglish: particular, own specific character, specific character, particular entity\nIn one passage of the Mūlasarvāstivādin-s’ Vinaya svalakṣaṇa and sāmānyalakṣaṇa seem to refer to the “specific meaning/understanding” and “general meaning/understanding” of the Buddha’s teachings. In a dispute among sūtradhara-s, vinayadhara-s, and mātṛkādhara-s, which is referred to in the Adhikaraṇavastu, all three groups claim their (exclusive) right to be entitled as  dharmadhara-s. The mātṛkādhara-s implicitly claim their superiority since they memorize (and transmit) both the svalakṣana and the sāmānyalakṣaṇa of the sūtra[-collection] and of the vinaya[-collection], and not only the totality of one of the two collections, as the other two groups do (see occurrences below).\nIn two passages of the Śrāvakabhūmi svalakṣaṇa and sāmānyalakṣaṇa occur with the tasi-affix with the common meaning of “in particular” and “in general.” The first passage explains the term cintanā (“reflection, consideration”): the practitioner has to reflect, in particular and in general, upon the dharma-s (except for six specific items) in accordance with the teaching (see occurrences below). The second passage refers to the abandonment of the fourth viparyāsa, i.e. the wrong conception of a Self with regard to what is not (or not endowed with) Self, by the practitioner, here technically called dharmānudarśin, who sees, that is to say contemplates, the dharma-s according to their true nature (see occurrences below).\nIn the Śrāvakabhūmi the two words are also used with a more technical meaning, referring to the first two ways in which a real object should be considered and examined. The text also describes with more details and according to the typical taxonomical explanations the three and five ways in which a svalakṣaṇa and a sāmānyalakṣaṇa should respectively be seen (see occurrences below).\nIn epistemological treatises the two terms are used to refer to the “particular” and the “universal”. In Buddhist epistemology the particular is the object of direct perception which cannot be expressed in words, whereas the “universal” is mentally produced and, as such, is defined as the object of inference (cf. Dharmakīrti’s Nyāyabindu 1.16–17: anyat sāmānyalakṣaṇam / so ’numānasya viṣayaḥ /, ed. Malvania pp. 77–78). Cf. also Hetubinduṭīkā, p. 23: svalakṣaṇaviṣayaṃ pratyakṣaṃ sāmānyalakṣaṇaviṣayam anumānam iti vacanāt, where this sentence is quoted by a pūrvapakṣin (see occurrences below).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:36296

So Wogihara, Lex. It occurs in no other of my texts unless in Bbh; Wogihara reads so in 62.6 and 68.5; actually it is read only in the latter place by one of the two mss. (which reads aniṣṭha in the former place), while the other ms. reads akaniṣṭha both times. Wogihara’s suggested interpretation, and those he quotes from Yaśomitra and Chin., seem to me fantastic and worthless. Cf. lokaniṣṭha\nThe term primarily refers to a specific class of gods (and in this sense only occurring in plural or in compound, where it is to be understood as plural), secondarily to their abode, and by extension also to the corresponding spiritual status/level leading to it. The compilers of the Mahāvyutpatti have listed the term under the fourth dhyānabhūmi (and specifically under five śuddhāvāsa-s).\nThe Tibetan rendering of aghaniṣṭha as thogs mtha’ (which is synonymous with gzugs mtha’) should be understood in the light of the explanation of agha provided by the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya (cited in TSD, s.v. thogs pa (3)): thogs pa zhes bya ba ni shin tu gnod par byar rung ba’i phyir bsags par gnas pa’i gzugs ste (aghaṃ kila citasthaṃ rūpam, atyarthaṃ ghātāt).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:148156

Tibetans seem to have effectively kept these two levels of meaning apart from each other by employing snying for the former sense and snying po for the latter.\nListed also as one of the (bodily) impure substances.\nIn tantric systems, a hṛdaya or hṛdayamantra is usually a mantra that is or expresses the essence of a deity. This is usually a relatively brief mantra, but as a rule not simply a single seed-syllable. It should be noted, however, that compounds such as hṛdayamantra or hṛdayabīja occur not infrequently as locative tatpuruṣas, i.e. meaning ‘mantra’ (or ‘seed-syllable’) ‘[visualized] in the heart’.

It may be specified, syntactically (in the loc), as in yaṃ … sugataḥ prabhāṣate, adhimuktisaṃpanna bhavāhi tatra SP 32.15, what the Buddha says, be perfect in zealous application to that. Usually it is not so specifically stated, tho the context is apt to suggest that it is zealous cultivation (study or propagation) of sacred texts or religious instruction that is meant (note - that the object of the verb adhimucyate is commonly something of this sort); cf. e. g. -lokaṃ yathādhimuktyā (according to their [varying types or degrees of] zeal or application) subhāṣitena saṃtoṣayantam LV 160.17; adhimuktisāro yo syād … saḥ, puṇyaṃ labheta yo etaṃ (most mss.) sūtraṃ vācel likheta vā SP 342.3–4.

mantra|Sanskrit: mantra <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of mantra:{sngags/}, {gsang sngags/}\n\nEnglish: magical formula\n“Mantras are magical formulas consisting of syllables or words arranged in a certain fixed manner and regarded as endowed with power and efficacy. As Padoux states in his discussion of mantras in the Hindu context, the belief in the power and efficacy of the mantra has survived in India from the Vedas down to the present. The employment of mantras as a religious instrument or procedure is common to diverse Indian traditions, particularly the Tantric ones. The centrality of mantras to the Tantric traditions is expressed by the fact that the tantraśāstras are often referred to as mantraśāstras, while Buddhist Tantrism is often referred to as Mantrayāna, Mantranaya, or simply Mantra. Nevertheless, as made clear by Padoux, the utterance of a mantra is considered efficient only within the given context of a strictly controlled ritual procedure, which is in turn embedded within a culture that presupposes the mantra’s efficacy. To guarantee their efficacy, mantras must be accurately pronounced, just as the mudrās, which often accompany them, must be accurately performed. According to Padoux, mantras can be properly explained only within an Indian tradition that has a corresponding metaphysical and mythical understanding of ‘speech’ (vāc), or within the traditions which inherited such understanding from India. This is a culture, he says, where speech “has always been considered as essential, as of divine origin, as playing a fundamental role in creation.” Nevertheless, the silent (tūṣṇīm) or mental (mānasa) utterance, he says, was always rated higher than the audible one, and the fact that, from the Vedic to the Tantric period, mantras become more repetitive, increasingly levelling linguistic content and phonetic variety, shows a general tendency towards silence. Padoux cites the ancient belief that thought or consciousness is identical with the highest, silent level of speech not only as one of the reasons for the superiority of silence over actual speech in mantric practice, but also as explaining why the function of the mantra is considered inseparable from the mind of its user. As already mentioned, mantras do not always have an obvious meaning, and Padoux points out that it is their inner organization and phonetic structure that are more important. Furthermore, they are significant or meaningful only within a particular ritual activity where they are considered active. In the case where mantras seem to ‘name’ a deity, Padoux notes, they are in fact an audible expression (vācaka) of the deity; to utter the deity’s mantra is to evoke or conjure its power. In other words, when the mantra is focused on, “the attention of the user may pass on to another plane, be it a postulated inner nature or essence of the mantra or some higher, transcendent reality of which the mantra is the expression (vācaka) and which would be intuited nondiscursively by the user through an intense and concentrated mental effort (dhāraṇa or bhāvanā).”\nThere are various types of formulas, of which the most common ones are (1) mantra ((gsang) sngags; lit. ‘speech’), (2) dhāraṇī (gzungs (sngags); lit. ‘holding,’ ‘keeping (in remembrance),’ ‘retention’), often understood as a kind of mnemonic formula, (3) vidyā (rig sngags; lit. ‘knowledge’), a formula which, as is evident from its designation, is associated with the acquirement of knowledge, (4) hṛdaya (snying po; lit. ‘heart,’ ‘quintessence’), which is conceived as the ‘personal spell’ of a deity, and (5) bīja (sa bon; lit. ‘[phonic] seed’ or ‘germ’), a single syllable conceived of as comprehending the essence of a particular deity. These terms are often used interchangeably to denote more or less the same thing. \nAccording to Rong-zom-pa, the mantra, as a generic term for the various kinds of magical formulas, expresses the union of insight and stratagem, which union in turn is conceived as an expression of Buddhahood in some of the Tantric systems. The signs of these formulas, which are employed as means of attaining Buddhahood, are viewed by him as the various manifestations of the buddhas, with mantras being the manifestations of male deities, and vidyās and dhāraṇīs of female ones.”\n\nmantra, gsang sngags – defined in the Dhyānottarapaṭalaṭīkā of Buddhaguhya 4a: de la rig sngags ni bud med kyi gzugs dang dbyibs kyi lha dang / de ston pa’i sgra dang/ phyag rgya la sogs pa’o // de las bzlog pa ni gsang sngags kyi mtshan nyid do //.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:35205

The texts draw a rather stereotyped profile of an ideal teacher with his virtues and qualifications, frequently proceeding from (variants of) the classical formulation given in Aśvaghoṣa’s Gurupañcāśikā, occasionally supplemented by its counterpart, the characterization of an incompetent teacher (see, for instance, the first chapter of Vajragarbha’s Hevajratantrapiṇḍārthaṭīkā). Particularly in the Kālacakra tradition, the attempt is made to establish a hierarchy among teachers in terms of their state as (fully) ordained, novice or householder.\nIn Buddhism, an ācārya can fulfil many different functions, and  several different kinds of such ācārya-s are often distinguished, as can e.g. be gleaned from the pertinent entry of the Hobogirin.\nācāryaḥ, slob dpon – several characterizations of suitable and unsuitable officiants are given: Guhyatantra vv. 5–10; ...

(parable of the burning house, the 3 yānas compared to carts of different sizes); for mahā-y° synonyms are buddha-y°, bodhisattva-y°, eka-y° (because, SP 40.13 f. says, this is really the only vehicle, na kiṃcic… dvitīyaṃ vā tṛtīyaṃ vā yānaṃ saṃvidyate); eka-y° also Mvy 1255; agra-yāna, q.v., id.; triyānam ekayānaṃ ca Laṅk 155.14; the 3 yānas mentioned, but not named, Mv ii.362.8 f., where it is specifically stated that one can attain parinirvāṇa by any of them, and no preference is expressed; in SP 43.7 (in times of corruption, the Tathāgatas) upāyakauśalyena tad evaikaṃ buddhayānaṃ triyānanirdeśena nirdiśanti; synonym of hīna-y° is also śrāvaka-y°; see the various terms, also nava-(acira-)-yāna-saṃprasthita.\nThe idea of ekayāna can be found in several Mahāyāna scriptures some of which, including the Saddharmapuṇḍarīkasūtra, have been cited in the Sūtrasamuccaya.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:18696

duHkhatA|Sanskrit: duḥkhatā <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of duḥkhatā:{sdug bsngal nyid/}, {sdug bsngal/}\n\nEnglish: unsatisfactoriness\nUsually, three kinds of duḥkhatā are distinguished in Buddhism (see the cited occurrences in primary sources).\nThe set of three kinds of duḥkhatā already appears in (arguably later strata of) the canonical sermons of Nikāya Buddhism.\nIt is generally recognized in Buddhism that there are not only painful or disagreeable (duḥkha) but also agreeable (sukha) and neutral sensations. However, the latter two can be regarded as characterized by unsatisfactoriness (duḥkhatā), too, since happiness is inherently liable to change and decay (vipariṇāma) and since neutral sensations can be associated with the most fundamental kind of unsatisfactoriness, viz., the inherent impermanence of all conditioned entities (saṃskāra). According to Schmithausen, this restriction of the application of the three kinds of unsatisfactoriness to the three kinds of sensations/feelings (vedanā) seems to mark the first step in the development of the concept.\nVasubandhu in his Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, however, restricts the character of being unsatisfactory in at least one of these three ways to only those conditioned entities that are contaminated (sāsrava), i.e. those that do not constitute  the Buddhist way to salvation. This view is typical for the later Sarvāstivādins and Yogācāras.\nThe set of three kinds of duḥkhatā is of central importance for the question of how the fundamental Buddhist belief that mundane existence (saṃsāra) is inherently characterized by “duḥkha” was justified and understood in mainstream Buddhism.\nAccording to Schmithausen, later on, the three kinds of duḥkhatā were interpreted in such a way that they do not only refer to the three kinds of sensations (vedanā), but to mundane existence (saṃsāra) as a whole.\nf.

rUpa|Sanskrit: rūpa <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of rūpa:{gzugs/}\n\nEnglish: Sichtbares, matter, material things, form-and-color, visual object, body\nIn Abhidharmic sources, rūpa as used in rūpaskandha and rūpa as used in rūpāyatana are not semantically co-extensive. That is, rūpa in the former sense includes rūpa in the latter sense, but not vice versa. In the former sense, rūpa is to be understood as something material including things that are not only visible but also those that are, for example, audible. And rūpa—in the sense of a visible object or visible matter (i.e. color and shape)—is one of the five sensory objects. According to some Tibetan sources, it is one of the “eleven [kinds of] resultant matter” (’bras gzugs bcu gcig). It also belongs to the seventy-five dharmas presented by the Sarvāstivāda tradition (for which, see Hirakawa 1973: xii–xiv).\nAccording to the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, rūpa is the fifth of the eight substances (dravya).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:21848

Textual evidence suggests, however, that there is also an alternative procedure with only one circle of deities involved: In some manuals such as, for instance, Dīpaṃkarabhadra’s Guhyasamājamaṇḍalavidhi or the Hevajrasekaprakriyā there is no such fusion.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:175788

Only rarely, this distinction is blurred, for instance, when vipakṣa is for metrical reasons employed instead of pratipakṣa (see the passage from the Abhidharmakośavyākhyā quoted in the section “Occurences in Primary Sources”).

The recent MSS. ABC simply end with the words Maitrakanyakāvadānaṃ samāptam, and in the subscriptions to the several legends they never add any general title; but the two older transcripts DE always prefix iti śrīdivyāvadāne, to each subscription as well as to the final one. This title also occurs in the Paris MS. F, see Appendix C.; and there is a MS. in the University Library (Add. 1538) of the Vīrakuśāvadāna which has as its colophon iti śrīdivyāvadānoddhṛta aṣṭamīvratamāhātmya-Kuśāvadānaṃ samāptam. Although this particular story is not found in our copies, the reference shows that the name was current in Nepal.\n(divya + ava°) n. Titel einer buddh. Legendensammlung (himmlische Thaten) Burn. Intr. 299.\nThe compilation entitled Divyāvadāna (Heavenly Avadānas), or Divyāvadānamālā (Garland of Heavenly Avadānas), possesses a different character. The individual parts of the text, mostly avadānas but occasionally also of the sūtra type, have different sources and dates (Tatelman, 2000, 12f.), which can easily be deduced by the diversity of theme, ideology, language, and style. All manuscripts hitherto known by the title Divyāvadāna(mālā) come from Nepal, and none is older than the 17th century. Concerning the narratives and their arrangement, they do not have much in common apart from a shared core of only seven narratives (according to Iwamoto, 1967, 143–149; see also Rotman, 2008, 8–5). One version with 38 narratives has been edited, entitled Divyāvadāna (Cowell & Neil, 1886; no. 38, however, is a later accretion to the archetype of the manuscripts used by Cowell & Neil; comp. Hahn, 2010a, 86), though no title occurs with the manuscripts used by the editors (comp. Cowell & Neil, 1886, viif.) Since, however, both titles, Divyāvadāna and Divyāvadānamālā, can be found in colophons of other manuscripts known so far (comp. the descriptive catalogue of the Nepalese-German Manuscript Cataloguing Project [NGMCP]), they should be seen as merely conventional designations as long as they are not used with regard to single manuscripts or clear-cut recensions of the textual tradition ... It is still uncertain whether the different versions that have been handed down can be traced back to one single source or whether the title Divyāvadāna(mālā) rather functioned as a kind of genre term. The date of the collection(s) also remains obscure.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:189642

[sa. agra-yāna], the chief vehicle (i.e. the state elephant), Ja VI 490,14* = 515,24* (kuñjaraṁ).’\nEDSHP gives references to other occurrences in non-Buddhist, especially lexicographical, texts. The meanings suggested are “leading vehicle” and “advancing, going or stepping forward”; but the Sanskrit sources cited also for the second of these seem to treat the word as a noun, with the meaning possibly ‘vanguard (of an army)’.\nAs is evident from different sources provided above and below, the term agrayāna/aggayāna has been used in a concrete/secular sense of the “chief vehicle,” ‘vanguard (of an army),” and the like, as well as in a soteriological sense of the “best soterial way/vehicle.” In the Pāli source quoted below, which might have been influenced by Mahāyāna ideas, aggayāna seems to be understood in the sense of way/vehicle leading to Buddhahood. In non-Tantric Mahāyāna sources, such as the Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra and *Vajracchedikāṭīkā, the term agrayāna would refer to the Bodhisattvayāna/Pāramitāyāna. In Tantric sources such as the Guhyasamājatantra and its commentaries, it is understood to be Vajrayāna/Mantrayāna.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:100513

Schmithausen 1987a (i.e. pp. 98–99) provides only the first possibility, but Schmithausen 2014 (i.e. p. 605, § 564.2) provides both alternatives, without extensive discussion. Sthiramati explains the compound as “that in which, or by which, the unreal, i.e. the two [object and subject] are imagined” (see Occurrences in Primary Sources below).\nAmong the three natures or characteristics taught in Yogācāra Buddhism, abhūtaparikalpa is identified with the dependent nature or characteristic (see also “Occurences in Primary Sources: Indic” below).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:218971

While the rendering “bgrod pa gcig pa” suggests something like “the only/single course,” the rendering “gcig pu bgrod pa” seems to suggest something like “the course with a single [goal].” The rendering “stan gcig” is, however, uncertain.\nThe compound ekāyana is frequently used in Pañcarātra/Pāñcarātra literature as an epithet of the system itself and of its teachings.  This compound seems to sometimes be used with the aim of stressing  that the Pāñcarātra represents the higher level of the Vedic revelation (see below Śrīpraśnasaṃhitā 2.38ab). In some passages (see below Īśvarasaṃhitā 1.18cd–19, 21.534cd and Pārameśvarasaṃhitā 1.57cd–58ab), the word ekāyana seems to have a strong anti-inclusivist flavour, implying that only the Pāñcarātra provides the devotees with a path leading to liberation. The word has also been used as a bahuvrīhi compound since the earliest works of the system as a reference to the four Vyūhas (Vāsudeva, Saṃkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha) and to a specific group of devotees (see below, Sātvatasaṃhitā 24.302ab, and the last stanza of the first chapter, perhaps originally an independent work [R. Torella’s personal communication], of the Saṃvitprakāśa by Vāmanadatta: ekāyane prasūtasya kaśmīreṣu dvijātmanaḥ / kṛtir vāmanadattasya seyaṃ bhagavadāśrayā //). For further details, see below, Discussion in Secondary Sources. See also\nIn astronomical works the compound ekāyana is used in the sense of “one solstitial half” and ekāyanagata is contrasted with viparītāyanagata (see below Sūryasiddhānta 11.1–2). Cf.\nSince the word ekāyana often serves as an adjective qualifying mārga, many of the modern renderings listed above reflect the word as if it were always in conjunction with mārga.

karmapatha|Sanskrit: karmapatha <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of karmapatha:{las kyi lam/}, {las lam/}\n\nEnglish: course of action\nIn Buddhism, this term usually refers to the ten unwholesome (akuśala) deeds or/and to their counterparts, the ten wholesome (kuśala) deeds.\nm. (nt. noted only Kv 46.1–2 daśa kuśalāni karmapathāny; = Pali kammapatha; seems to be a fundamentally Buddhist term, tho recorded once by BR in Mbh. Calc. 13.583, which is followed by a list of the ten items substantially as in Buddhism, belief in the law of fruition of actions taking the place of No. 10, abstention from heresy), course of action; almost always, as in Pali, of a set of ten good (kuśala) actions consisting in avoidance of ten bad (akuśala) actions, three of body (taking life, theft, fornication or adultery), four of speech (lying, harsh speech, spiteful speech, idle or silly, disconnected speech), and three of mind (covetousness, malevolence, heresy); these are listed without use of the term karmapatha, as daśākuśalāni and or daśa kuśalāni, in Dharmas 56 and Mvy 1681–4, 1685–1698; but the same list is given in texts as the ten (a)kuśala karmapatha, so Mv i.107.13–15; Divy 301.22–25; 302.7–10; Śikṣ 69.13 ff. and Dbh 23.6 ff., in both of which each item is treated at some length, esp. in Śikṣ which describes the torments suffered in hell by those guilty of each of the 10 sins; in Mv ii.99.5–12 the ten karmapatha are slightly different; a fourth sin of the body (use of liquor) is added, and the number ten is kept by omitting one of the 4 sins of speech (harshness), also avidyā, ignorance, replaces abhidhyā, covetousness (this seems likely to be a mere corruption of tradition); in Mv i.26.12 akuśala karmapatha is used more loosely, of sinful acts in general, specifically exemplified by the five ānantarya, q.v.; in Mv i.282.14 the term ten kuśala karmapatha (in prose) is immediately followed (in verses) by a list of ten vaśitā, apparently implying that they are the same (not the usual 10 karmapatha); in Suv 6.11 the expression is daśakuśalamūlakarmapatha; often a form of the verb sam-ā-dā-, adopt, take to, adhere to, governs the noun, as in Mv ii.77.11 daśa kuśalakarmapathāṃ (acc. pl.) samāḍāya; Suv\n 6.11 … °thaṃ samādāpayet; in Mv ii.425.10 read with mss. daśakuśalakarmapathasamādānaṃ vartitvā (= vartayitvā, having practised the taking-upon-oneself, the vow, of …); cf. samādiyati, °dāpayati, °dāna; other references to the 10 kuśala, or akuśala, karmapatha, without listing, are found Mv i.3.1; 46.10; 101.18; 193.15; iii.357.14; Divy 318.22; Karmav 31.13, 14; Gv 521.4.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:232905

The practitioner is always a “noble person” (ārya), which implies that he has already beforehand destroyed the intellectual spiritual defilements on the path of vision (darśanamārga).

dharmadhAtu|Sanskrit: dharmadhātu <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of dharmadhātu:{chos kyi dbyings/}\n\nEnglish: True Reality\nThis is one of the equivalents of tathatā according to the Yogācārabhūmi\nThe term is also often treated as a synonym of tathatā in later Yogācāra works.\nThis meaning of the term dharmadhātu has to be distinguished from its use in the scheme of 18 dhātu-s, where it designates the objects of the manovijñāna.\nIn the Madhyāntavibhāga the term is explained as being the “cause of the [transmundane] dharma-s,” and Vasubandhu’s commentary explains that these noble (ārya) dharma-s arise from the dharmadhātu when it is taken as object (ālambana). Sthiramati’s sub-commentary specifies these dharma-s as consisting in correct insight (samyagdṛṣṭi) etc.\nHowever, the term can also be understood as “cause (or source) of the doctrinal texts (dharma),” as becomes clear from Sthiramati’s sub-commentary on the Madhyāntavibhāgabhāṣya and the Dharmadharmatā(pra)vibhāga.\nIn the old sermons of the Buddha, dharmadhātu, similarly as tathatā, rather had the meaning “nature of things” or “rule by which they must abide.”\ndharmadhātuḥ – nirukti given in Mitapadā Pañjikā of Durjayacandra (ad 2.4.15): dharmas tathatā, tāṃ dadhātīti dharmadhātuḥ kalpanājñānaśūnyaṃ vijñānam /.\nm. 1 Dharma-Element, Sphäre des Dharma; (s. dhātu, 4; BHSD s.v.: religion’; Geiger, Dhamma, S.69: ‘Wahrheit als Element, in ihrer Urgestalt’; SN(G) II 81: ‘das Wesen der Wahrheit’).\n2 das Element ‘Geistpbjekt’; (s. dhatu, 2).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:21093

Kano Kazuo also points out that an Abhidharmasūtra verse is also cited in the Ratnagotravibhāga and in Vairocanarakṣita’s Triṃśsikāṭīkāvivṛti on Vinitadeva’s Triṃśsikāṭīkā (Kano 2005: 137).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:288797

mahArAja|Sanskrit: mahārāja <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of mahārāja:{rgyal po chen po/}\n\n( = Pali id.), (1) one of the four guardians of the cardinal directions, corresponding to Skt. lokapāla, and called by this name Dharmas 7, MSV i.255.17, and Mvy 3145 as sometimes in Pali, but usually mahārāja(n) in both Pali and BHS: catvāro (°raś ca) mahārājāno or °rājā LV 202.13; 366.11; Divy 218.9; Av i.67.10; ii.104.2, 12; instr. Mv i.230.12; often, as in some of the above, included in lists of other gods; mahārājasthānam SP 264.12, the position of world-guardian, as one of five states which a woman cannot attain. Pali and BHS differ from Skt. in the names assigned to the four individuals, except that Kuvera (Kubera), oftener called Vaiśravaṇa (Pali Vessavaṇa), sometimes Dhanada or other synonyms, is the guardian of the north, as usually in Skt. The other three (in Skt. normally Indra, Yama, and Varuṇa) are Dhṛtarāṣṭra (east), Virūḍhaka (rarely Virūḍha; south), and Virūpākṣa (west; Pali Dhataraṭṭha, Virūļha(ka), and Virūpakkha). These four are named, Dharmas 7 (as lokapāla); Mvy 3146–9 (as prec, lokapālaḥ 3145); SP 4.6-7; LV 217.16, 20; 218.4, 9; Suv 64.2–3; LV 382.19 ff. (names 384.6, 10, 11, 15, 16, 20, 21; 385.3); LV 388.3, 389.1, 21, 390.19 = Mv iii.306.9, 307.13, 308.13, 309.13; Mmk 654.21; the four are mentioned as devādhipatayaḥ among the kāmāvacara gods whom Māra perceives as favoring the Bodhisattva, LV 302.5–6; and elsewhere in lists of other gods, e. g. Mv i.245.8-9 where Vaiśravaṇa is separated in the list of gods from the other three; sometimes not all are named, thus only Virūḍhaka, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Kubera (with other gods) Mmk 434.27-435.1; only Vaiśravaṇa and Virūḍhaka, both styled mahārājo, SP 398.8, 399.5; only Virūḍhaka Mv iii.72.3 (mahārājo), and 84.1, 6; Indro Virūḍhakādyāś ca (-ādya including the other three?) Laṅk 367.14; in some of the above the fact is mentioned that Vaiśravaṇa is lord of the yakṣas, Dhṛtarāṣṭra of gandharvas, Virūḍhaka of kumbhāṇḍas, and Virūpākṣa of nāgas; these functions, rather than their position as mahārāja (lokapāla), are exclusively noted in Mvy 3367 (Vaiśr°, first of yakṣas), 3381 (Dhṛt°, of gandharvas), 3437 (Virūḍhaka, of kumbhāṇḍas; no similar statement in Mvy about Virūp°); and, in longer lists of gods, also in Divy 126.6-8; 148.18-19; Av i.108.8-9; Gv 249.24-250.2. The forms of the names Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Virūpākṣa never vary; Virūḍha without final -ka (also recorded in Pali) has been noted only Av i.108.9 and Mmk 654.21 (here vs, perhaps m.c.); Vaiśravaṇa (see also °ramaṇa) is the regular form, for which Kuvera or Kub° is found Dharmas 7; LV 218.9; 390.19 = Mv iii.309.13; Mmk 435.1; Dhanada Divy 126.8; 148.19; Av i.108.9; yakṣarāṭ Mmk 654.21 (vs). In MSV i.258.2 ff. Dhrtarāṣṭra and Virūḍhaka are said to be Aryans (ārya-jātīya), Virūpākṣa and Vaiśravaṇa Dasyus; the Buddha resolves to convert them using āryā vāc and dasyuvāc respectively; he then preaches to the first two in normal BHS, to the others (259.2, 7) using what appear to be meaningless groups of sounds.\npl.

The Four Limbs are worship (sevā, q.v. respectively sevāvidhāna, q.v.), near realisation (upasādhana, q.v.), realisation (sādhana, q.v.) and realisation par excellence (mahāsādhana, q.v.). In the exegetical literature relating to the Guhyasamājatantra, the application of the aṅgacatuṣṭaya varies depending on the respective tradition: in the Ārya tradition, the set of four limbs covers the entire generation process of the presiding deity and its maṇḍala, whereas in the Jñānapāda school, the set of four is applied separately  for each, the main deity, the consort and the deities of the maṇḍala. The threefold application is accounted for by a further terminological differentiation into gentle (mṛdu), middling (madhya) and exceeding (adhimātra). Exegetical literature frequently presents the correlation of the Four Limbs with associated terminological sets such as the four kāya-s or the five jñāna-s.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:105788

(°kam ind. = on the top of, upon e.g. cullī-mastakam, upon the hearth…)\nThe Tibetan word klad spri, klad spris, or klad pri (see above), which is a rendering of mastaka, is explained as klad pa’i skyi dkar, klad shun, klad shubs, and klad rgya (Tshig mdzod chen mo, s.vv.). Accordingly, klad spri or klad spris should be understood here as “cerebral membrane.” The Tibetan word klad rgyas, a rendering of mastakaluṅga, is obviously to be understood as “cerebrum” or “brain marrow.” See, for example, the Tshig mdzod chen mo (s.v. klad rgyas): klad pa las ’bab pa’i kha chu ’byar tshi can. This is also equated by some with lha ba (Jäschke 1881: s.v.).

From an Abhidharmic point of view, a deva is a heavenly/divine being, usually endowed with splendour and power, who, on account of mundane/defiled merits, is spontaneously born in one of the six uppermost realms of the sphere of sexual desire (kāmadhātu), or in the sphere of (fine) matter / the sphere associated with corporeality (rūpadhātu), or in the sphere of immateriality / the sphere not associated with corporeality (ārūpyadhātu), and who subsequently, due to the exhaustion of the merits, falls to a lower realm of existence. Later Buddhist sources often classify such divine beings into mundane (laukika) and supramundane (lokottara) on the basis of soteriological criteria: ordinary beings (pṛthagjana) who are born in the celestial realms on account of their wholesome actions are considered laukika, and noble beings (ārya) who assume the form of a celestial being are considered lokottara.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:29802

vaidyapAda|Sanskrit: Vaidyapāda <Personal Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Vaidyapāda:{sman pa'i zhabs/}, {sman zhabs/}\n\n*Vaidyapāda was a direct student of Jñānapāda (roughly late 8th to early 9th century). The latter’s works were, though not exclusively, in the focus of *Vaidyapāda’s exegetical activity. As a colleague and presumably junior contemporary of Dīpaṃkarabhadra, he also produced an important commentary on the Guhyasamājamaṇḍalavidhi. The commonly used form *Vitapāda is quite improbable. In the colophon of the Tibetan translation of this scholar’s commentary on the Samājottara, his name is written “bai dya pā da.” The usual Tibetan rendering of his name, sMan pa’i zhabs, in fact seems to support this form (which had also been suggested by van der Kuijp and recorded by Szántó).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:393573

virUpa|Sanskrit: Virūpa <Personal Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Virūpa:{ngan pa/}, {spyan gsum/}, {spyan gsum pa/}\n\nThis mahāsiddha is frequently mentioned in the Vanaratna Codex under the name Virūpākṣa (and variations of it, namely, Śrīvirūpākṣapāda, Śrīmadvirūpākṣa, Śrīvirūpākṣa, Yogīndravirūpākṣābhidhānaka).\nHarunaga Isaacson (Isaacson 2008a: 3, n. 15) points out that Virūpa is actually understood as a short form of Virūpākṣa and that the Vanaratna Codex always uses the longer form. Of the two Tibetan renderings of the name Virūpa provided above, “Ngan pa” renders virūpa (“ugly” or “unnatural”) and “sPyan gsum (pa)” presupposes the full form Virūpākṣa (“having unnatural/unusual eyes”), which is originally a name of Śiva, so-called because he has three eyes. This is precisely also one of the two explanations that we find in the Madhyavyutpatti or sGra sbyor bam po gnyis pa (no. 170, cited under the entry “Virūpākṣa”), and hence it has been translated there as “mig mi ’dra ba” (“unusual eyes”) and  “mig mi bzang” (“awful/ghastly eyes”).\nThe name Virūpa is transliterated into Tibetan in various ways: Bi/Bhi ru pa and Bir ba/wa pa. Notably, the dBus pa blo gsal bstan ’gyur dkar chag (see above, “Tibetan Renderings”) glosses Bir ba pa with “Ngan pa” and Bi ru pa with “sPyan gsum (pa),” giving the impression that these were considered by the glosser as being two different persons.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:421012
tathAgata|Sanskrit: tathāgata <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of tathāgata:{de bzhin 'ongs pa/}, {de bzhin gshegs/}, {de bzhin gshegs pa/}\n\nEnglish: The One Thus Gone\nOne of the most common epithets of the (or a) Buddha.\nIn Buddhist texts, there are many alternative etymological explanations of the term. Particularly  common are probably the analysis of the compound in either (a) tathā (“thus”) + gata (“gone,” but also “understood”) or (b) tathā (“thus”) + āgata (“come”). Moreover, quite frequently the element -gata is derived from √gad (to speak). The latter interpretation becomes understandable, if one compares the Gāndhārī equivalent of Skt. tathāgata (see above).\nListed in the Mahāvyutpatti as one of the eighty appellations (paryāya) of (a/the) Tathāgata.\nListed in the Amarakośa as one of the eighteen appellations (paryāya) of a Buddha.\nListed in the Abhidhānappadīpikā as one of the thirty-two appellations (paryāya) of a Buddha.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:272296
nidAnanimitta|Sanskrit: nidānanimitta <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of nidānanimitta:{gzhi'i mtshan ma/}\n\nEnglish: nimitta in the sense of “cause”\nOne of the basic kinds of nimitta distinguished in Yogācāra meditation theory and taxonomy. In the Samāhitā Bhūmiḥ chapter of the Yogācārabhūmi, it is listed once as one of the four fundamental kinds of nimitta (mūlanimitta). In two other places of the same chapter, nimitta is subdivided only into two kinds, viz. into nidānanimitta and ālambananimitta.\nAccording to the text passages from the Samāhitā Bhūmiḥ cited below under “occurrences,”  the present kind of nimitta refers to the preparative practice (prayoga) or accumulation of prerequisites for entering into a deep concentration (samādhisaṃbhāra). However, one of these text passages mentions that the various kinds of nimitta in the sense of “meditation object” (ālambananimitta) can also be regarded as a nimitta in the sense of “cause” (nidānanimitta) inasmuch as they are instrumental in letting the respective meditation object appear gradually in an ever clearer form.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:422707

Tāranathā states that his account is based on three Indian sources, but some Tibetan sources state that Vāgīśvarakīrti was the “keeper of the southern gate” (lho sgo srung ba) and Prajñākaramati the “keeper of the western gate” (nub sgo srung ba).\nA close contemporary of Advayavajra was Vāgīśvarakīrti, who was best known for his argumentative works and passages concerning initiation, more specifically the fourth initiation (caturthābhiṣeka), of which he was an advocate.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:440592

jJAnaz rImitra|Sanskrit: Jñānaśrīmitra <Personal Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Jñānaśrīmitra:{ye shes bshes gnyen dpal/}, {dzyā na shrī mi tra/}\n\nAccording to Tibetan sources, Jñānaśrīmitra was one of those scholars known as the “six gate-keeping paṇḍitas” (mkhas pa sgo drug) of the Vikramaśīla monastic seminary, and “the second of the [two] great central pillars” (dbus kyi ka chen dang po).\nSome Tibetan sources ascribe a tantric treatise named rDo rje theg pa’i mtha’ gnyis sel ba to Jñānaśrīmitra.\nThe Sanskrit originals of Jñānaśrīmitra’s various works have been among the findings of Rāhula Sāṅkṛtyāyana in Tibetan monasteries. The twelve texts, ranging from small essays to extensive monographs within the full range of late Indian Buddhist theory, have been edited by Anantalal Thakur. Apart from these recovered texts Jñānaśrīmitra has also written a Sarvajñasiddhi, which is occasionally quoted in his other works. A number of fragments which are explicitly stated to come from the Sarvajñasiddhi can thus be collected. But this collection can be considerably enlarged in the following way. A. Thakur has already noted that Ratnakīrti, Jñānaśrīmitra’s pupil, when composing his own Sarvajñasiddhi, has not only used his teacher’s Yoginirṇayaprakaraṇam, but also his Sarvajñasiddhi…  Ratnakīrti’s Sarvajñasiddhi thus shows the general characteristic of his works which present the main points of his teacher’s essays on the same subject in the style of a strictly formal, logical argumentation.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:440640

Buddhist logicians classify a pseudo-reason as belonging to one of three types: unestablished (asiddha), inconclusive (anaikāntika), or opposed (viruddha), with various sub-classifications for each of these types.  The class of a pseudo-reason depends on the way in which it deviates from the three requirements: if the property used as a reason is not, in fact, present in the case that the inference is about, it is an unestablished reason; if the reason-property is present not only in cases that have the property to be proven, but also in cases which do not have that property, i.e., in the vipakṣa, then the reason-property is inconclusive; if it is present only in the vipakṣa, it is opposed.\nWhen one turns to consider what Indian logicians have to say about  fallacies of the hetu, one is struck by the lack of agreement on such topics not only between philosophers of different schools but also between Naiyāyikas themselves. In part this reflects the difficulty felt by everyone about getting any rigorous classification of fallacies, but it is even more apparent that our philosophers were victimized by a horrible confusion over terminology.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:36253

He may also have visited Tibet. Some modern sources refer to him as Newar or Nepalese, but there appears to be no evidence for him having been originally from Nepal.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:479419

mUlanimitta|Sanskrit: mūlanimitta <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of mūlanimitta:{mtshan ma'i rtsa ba/}\n\nIn the Samāhitā Bhūmiḥ chapter of the Basic Section of the Yogācārabhūmi, a large section deals first with four kinds of nimitta, then with another set of 32 nimitta-s. Afterwards it is taught how these 32 nimitta-s relate to the 4 kinds of nimitta discussed before. Here, the latter are specified as being the four basic kinds of nimitta (mūlanimitta).\nThe first two kinds, viz. nimitta in the sense of the “meditation object”  (ālambananimitta) and nimitta in the sense of “cause” (nidānanimitta), represent two basic types that are also used elsewhere in the Samāhitā Bhūmiḥ to explain the term nimitta in the context of meditation theory. They are seemingly not necessarily mutually exclusive categories, i.e. a nimitta in the sense of “cause” can under certain circumstances become an object of meditation and a nimitta in the sense of the “meditation object” can also become a cause. The other two kinds, viz. parivarjanīyaṃ nimittam and pratiniṣevaṇīyaṃ nimittam, can be used to label individual nimitta-s as spiritually defiled or undefiled, respectively.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:486241

kaz ambakajAta|Sanskrit: kaśambakajāta <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of kaśambakajāta:{shing rul ba lta bur gyur pa/}, {shing rul ba lta bur gyur pa/}\n\nEnglish: rotten\nThe term kaśambakajāta occurs in Buddhist sources, such as the Madhyamāgama (Taisho 1.507b19–21), Śrāvakabhūmi (see below), and also in the Mahāvyutpatti (Sakaki, nos. 9136–9144; Ishihama, nos. 9073–9079), in a stock phrase describing a monk whose ethical-ascetical integrity/discipline is defective.\nbesudelt, unrein / defiled, dirty, impure (buddhist.) pāli kasambu- Schmutz, Unreinheit, kasambujāta- unrein, kasambukajāta- dss.\nThe etymology is uncertain.\nNote that the Chinese and Tibetan traditions seem to have read or interpreted the headword differently (although all referring to something “impure”), and consequently also translated it differently. The Tibetan translation of the Vyākhyāyukti compares the bad monk to a piece of “rotten wood” (shing rul ba), and the Tibetan translation of the Paryāyasaṃgrahaṇī of the Yogācārabhūmi compares him to “water polluted with rotten wood” (shing rul gyis brnyogs pa’i chu). Xuanzang’s translation of the Paryāyasaṃgrahaṇī compares him to a “snail born in (pure) water,” which pollutes the pure water. It should also be noted that in the Śrāvakabhūmi, the manuscript reading is kaśambodakajātaḥ rather than kaśambakajātaḥ.\nkaśambaka-jāta (also written kaṣ°, kas°; = Pali kasambu-jāta, with var. kasambuka-j°), acc. to Tib. on Mvy, rotten; this is consistent with the lit. mg. in Pali, applied to a tree the inside of which is rotten, see s.v. avasruta; the orig. mg. was forgotten in Pali at an early time, as the vague and inconsistent Pali comms. show; e.g. Vin. ii.236.26, comm. 1287.5 = ākiṇṇadosatāya saṃkiliṭṭhajātaṃ; Pugg.p. 27.10, comm. 207.25 either kasambu = kacavara, rubbish, or = tinta-kuṇapa-gataṃ kasaṭa-udakaṃ (evidently guessing): Mvy 9139 kaṣ° (but Mironov kaś°) = Tib. śiṅ rul ba (rotten) lta bur gyur pa; [Page174-b+ 71] follows antarpūty avasrutaḥ (all part of a longer cliché found repeatedly in Pali, e. g. in Vin. and Pugg.p., ll.cc.); MSV i.50.7 kaṣ°; Śikṣ 67.20 kaśambakajāto aśramaṇaḥ etc. (as in Mvy 9143-4); AsP 181.20 kas°. Could this word be related to kasavva Deśīn.\n 2.53, said to have four mgs., (1) stokam, (2) ārdram, wet, (3) pracuraṃ, (4) bāṣpaḥ?

vidyA|Sanskrit: vidyā <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of vidyā:{rig sngags/}\n\nEnglish: magical spell, apotropaic text\nThe word vidyā, which primarily means ‘knowledge,’ has also been used to denote a magical formula. In this sense it can be either used in the same meaning as mantra, or it can denote a particular type of magical spell. In the course of time, the magical formulas came to be identified with deities. In accordance with the grammatical gender, vidyā is associated with goddesses and mantra with male deities. The term vidyā may also refer to apotropaic texts.\nRong zom pa in his rGyud spyi’i dngos po treats vidyā (rig sngags) along with mantra (gsang sngags) and dhāraṇī (gzungs sngags) as a subtype of mantra (sngags) and goes on to explain each from the point of view of their actual nature (rang gi ngo bo), subclass (rab tu dbye ba), function (las), symbolical representation (rtags), means of access (sgo), factors opposed to them (mi mthun pa’i phyogs) and their antidotes (gnyen po), properties common to them (chos mthun pa), properties uncommon to each (tha dad chos), all possible applications (ji snyed ’jug pa), and their etymologies (nges pa’i tshig). According to Rong zom pa, vidyā is associated with the acquirement of knowledge. It “makes [one] cognize the [true] meaning of things in that it destroys and eliminates non-realization.” And “it manifests as female deities, and its essence is of the [combined] nature of insight and gnosis.” He further provides the following etymologies: “[The term] rig sngags [is the Tibetan rendering of the Sanskrit] vidyā, [which is associated with the words] (i) vidhūta, which means ‘destroying’ and ‘eliminating,’ and hence [vidyā] is explained as that which destroys and eliminates the defilements consisting in ignorance, (ii) vindati, which conveys [the meaning of] ‘attainment,’ and hence [vidyā] refers to the attainment of excellences or to the attainment of speech cognition, or (iii) vidyāsvabhāva, where ‘essence’ (ngo bo nyid: svabhāva) refers to knowledge, and in general expresses the meaning of the realized truth as well, and therefore [it] is called rig sngags.”\nvidyā, rig sngags – defined in the Dhyānottarapaṭalaṭīkā of Buddhaguhya 4a: de la rig sngags ni bud med kyi gzugs dang dbyibs kyi lha dang / de ston pa’i sgra dang/ phyag rgya la sogs pa’o // de las bzlog pa ni gsang sngags kyi mtshan nyid do //.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:567422

The editor emends the manuscript reading lokacitrikeṣu to lokacitreṣu. However, in spite of the fact that the eight individual items are compounds ending in the term citra rather than *citrika, this is a rather bold decision.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:568705

The word would then literally mean “those having [only] three states,” i.e. birth (janma), existence (sattā), and death (vināśa), having no old age. It is this understanding that underlies the Tibetan rendering skabs gsum pa (see one of the two explanations of the word found in the Tshig mdzod chen mo and cited below under “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Tibetan Autochthonous Works”). It should be noted, however, that both in traditional Indian sources and in modern scholarship other explanations of the word have been put forward, e.g. that it may mean the (approximately) three times ten, in other words might have originally been equivalent to trayastriṃśa (cf., e.g., the Tibetan rendering sum cu rtsa gsum pa’i lha mentioned above and the citation from the Avadānaśataka provided under “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Indic”). See for other interpretations also the citation from Amara: South Indian Commentaries provided under “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Indic.” One more interpretation of skabs gsum pa mentioned in the Tshig mdzod chen mo (see below “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Tibetan Autochthonous Works”) is “those who know three states, namely, the preceding state, present state, and following state.”\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:584489

Regarding the latter, Mayrhofer gives “highest part, top, surface” as meaning (already attested in the Ṛgveda). Moreover, he notes that the etymology is unclear, but that the word is probably derived from vi and √stabh. Apte gives the meanings “place, region, world; heaven” and “world; vessel, cup” for viṣṭap and viṣṭapa, respectively.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:584239

However, this back-translation is problematic, and we suggest *Vādipuṅgava as the epithet.\nThis is considered as an epithet/byname of Dignāga. According to some biographical accounts in Tibet, Dignāga “defeated heretics in debates, and was called the ‘Bull in discussion’ (tarka-puṅgava).”\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:594146

nyUnatA|Sanskrit: nyūnatā <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of nyūnatā:{ma tshang/}, {ma tshang ba nyid/}\n\nEnglish: incompleteness, lack\nWhen the words nyūna, nyūnatā, and nyūnatva are used as technical terms of Indian logic, they denote the lack/incompleteness of any means of proof.\nBefore Dignāga’s Pramāṇasamuccaya (abb. PS), the lack/incompleteness of any necessary elements of proof means the lack/incompleteness of five (i.e., pratijñā, hetu, dṛṣṭānta, upasaṃhāra, and nigamana) or three (i.e., pakṣa, hetu, dṛṣṭānta)  members of proof. But after Dignāga argues in his Pramāṇasamuccaya that only the three characteristics (trirūpa) of the logical reason should be regarded as the means of proof, but not Naiyāyika’s five members of proof, the term nyūnatā (and also nyūna and nyūnatva) refers also to the lack/incompleteness of any one of the three characteristics. This new meaning of nyūnatā becomes dominant among Indian and East Asian Buddhists.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:597598

The words adhiśīlam etc. were orig. adverbs (adhi governing the second member, in a manner referring to…) and are still so used, e.g. Bbh 373.20--21 adhiśīlaṃ (and adhicittaṃ, adhiprajñaṃ) śikṣā; loc. forms are also used in the same way, as adhicitte ca āyogaḥ Ud xxxii.27(32) = Pali Dnp. 185 (same text). These forms may be turned into adjectives: adhiśīlo vihāro Bbh 335.1; sa vihāraḥ adhicitta ity ucyate Bbh 338.21 (this usage seems not recorded in Pali). Often the stems adhiśīla-, adhicitta-, adhiprajña- are used as prior members of cpds., in which case precise analysis becomes difficult; so Bbh 185.14; 333.2; 335.3; 338.24; 341.8; etc. But sometimes adhiprajñā-śikṣā is used as a cpd., Dharmas 140, the prior member being then evidently taken as stem of a noun. As nouns, adhiśīla, adhicitta, and adhiprajñā, like their Pali equivalents, are used Mvy 930--2; Bbh 317.2 (parallel with adhimuktiḥ), being then reinterpreted (with adhi = adhika) as superior morality, intellect, wisdom, see CPD s.vv. adhisīla, °citta, °paññā[.]\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:612942

avasruta|Sanskrit: avasruta <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of avasruta:{phyir 'dzag pa/}, {nyes 'dzag du gyur pa/}\n\nEnglish: wet, dripping, foul, rotten\nThe term avasruta occurs in Buddhist sources, such as the Madhyamāgama (Taisho 1.507b19–21), Śrāvakabhūmi (see below), and also in the Mahāvyutpatti (Sakaki, nos. 9136–9144; Ishihama, nos. 9073–9079), in a stock phrase describing a monk whose ethical-ascetical integrity/discipline is defective.\nOf the eight items occurring in a phrase describing a monk whose ethical-ascetical integrity/discipline is defective, the Mahāvyutpatti pairs avasruta with antaḥpūti (rendering them as khongs myags shing phyir ’dzag pa). Sakaki’s edition treats the two as a compound (i.e. antaḥpūtyavasruta), whereas Ishihama’s edition as a phrase (i.e. antaḥpūtir avasrutaḥ). The Śrāvakabhūmi and Paryāyasaṃgrahaṇī treat avasruta as a separate item.\nadj. (= Pali avassuta), wet, dripping, and so foul, rotten, orig. of a tree the inside of which is rotten, Pali AN iv.171.9 (rukkhāni) antopūtīni avassutāni kasam-bujātāni; fig., usually in Pali, and in BHS, of evil monks: Mvy 9138 antarpūty (read as separate word, see antaḥpūti) avasrutaḥ; foll, by kaṣambaka-jātaḥ (see kaśambaka); MSV i.50.7 antaḥpūtir °taḥ kaṣambaka-jātaḥ.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:614269
z aGkhasvarasamAcAra|Sanskrit: śaṅkhasvarasamācāra <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of śaṅkhasvarasamācāra:{lung bong ltar spyod pa/}, {bong bu ltar kun tu spyod pa/}, {lung bong ltar kun tu spyod pa/}, {lung bong lta bur kun tu spyod pa/}\n\nThe term śaṅkhasvarasamācāra occurs in Buddhist sources, such as the Madhyamāgama (Taisho 1.507b19–21), Śrāvakabhūmi (see below), and also in the Mahāvyutpatti (Sakaki, nos. 9136–9144; Ishihama, nos. 9073–9079), in a stock phrase describing a monk whose ethical-ascetical integrity/discipline is defective.\nThe prehistory and history of the term śaṅkhasvarasamācāra seem to be rather complex. There seems to have been uncertainty or confusion already in Pāli sources. The Chinese rendering in Guṇabhadra’s translation of the Saṃyuktāgama (吹貝之聲) seems to be based on a reading śaṅkhasvarasamācāra. Xuanzang translates as if reading *śaṅkhasvaraśvānācāra (螺音狗行). However, it is not impossible that the use of a word meaning “dog” rather than “donkey” is based on a somewhat different interpretation of the expression. The Tibetan tradition, on the other hand, seems to consistently have rendered the term as lung bong ltar spyod pa or lung bong ltar kun tu spyod pa or bong bu ltar kun tu spyod pa (“one who conducts himself like a domestic ass”), an interpretation which is supported by Vasubandhu’s explanation in his Vyākhyāyukti. One may speculate that śaṅkhasvara may have been intended, or at least interpreted, as meaning “an animal who makes a sound like the sound of a conch, i.e. a donkey.” Compare the verses from the *Gardabhasūtra cited below under Occurrences in Primary Sources: Indic. The Tibetan rendering may, in fact, be a “meaning translation” (don ’gyur) rather than a literal rendering (sgra sgyur) of śaṅkhasvarasamācāra.\nThe Pāli equivalent saṅkassarasamācāra (see the quotation from the BHSD below) remains somewhat enigmatic. However, cases of de-aspiration in Pāli consonant clusters are sometimes met with (cf. Oberlies, Pāli Grammar). For references to earlier discussions of the Pāli term, see Konow 1909.\nadj. m. (Pali saṅkassara, usually cpd. with samācāra, or sometimes ācāra; sometimes the Pali cpd. begins with asuci-; Pali comms., e.g. Pugg. comm. 207.5 ff., Dhp. comm. iii.485.1 ff., have various labored and implausible interpretations assuming connexion with saṅkā = Skt. śaṅkā, root śaṅk), of vile conduct; etym. and precise mg. unknown: follows kaṣambaka-jāta (see kaś°) in Mvy, MSV, and occurs in the same cliché in Pali, referring to wicked monks: Mvy 9140; MSV i.50.7; Śikṣ 64.5. Tib. on Mvy cited as lug pon (?) ltar (like) spyad pa (conduct); Mvy 9141 and 9142 (not in Mironov) are given as synonyms or variants, khānta-samācāra and saṃkasu(note k, not kh)samācāra; Tib. this time (on 9141) luṅ rul-ba (rotten, see s.v. kaśambaka-) lta-bur gyur-pa; Jap. rendering of 9142 contains the word rotten. Both Mvy 9141 and 9142 seem evident corruptions, and śaṅkha-svara- looks like an unhistoric (hyper-Skt.) form. The Tib. renderings are prob. also corrupt; at least the Tib. Dictt. give no clue to what they might mean. Perhaps luṅ (on Mvy 9141), and maybe even lug (on Mvy 9140), may be corrupt for duṅ = Skt. śaṅkha, shell.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:64735

They are: manas, anumantṛ, viṣṇu, manu, nārāyaṇa, taponidhi, nimi, haṃsa, dharma, kīrtita, visu, and prasu. In Jātarūpa’s commentary, instead of visu and prasu, we have vibhu and prabhu. The list found in the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa (1.119.11–12) reads: matta, unmatta, prāṇa, nara, apāṇa, citti, nara, haya, haṃsa, nārāyaṇa, vibhu, and prabhu. According to the Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa (2,3.16–17), the list is: manas, anumantṛ, prāṇa, nara, apāna, viti, naya, haya, haṃsa, nārāyaṇa, vibhu, prabhu.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:615498

He is also counted among the twelve “chief Tantric masters of Vikramaśīla” (rnam gnon tshul gyi sngags pa’i slob dpon). According to Tāranātha’s account of *Bodhibhadra’s life, he was born in a vaiśya family in Odiśa (Oḍiviśa) and became proficient in works such as the Bodhisattvabhūmi. He was also an expert in Buddhist and non-Buddhist Tantric doctrines.  He is said to have attained siddhi via teachings of the Nāmasaṃgīti and had a direct vision of Mañjuśrī.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:623780
pratiSedhadvayena prakRtagamana|Sanskrit: pratiṣedhadvayena prakṛtagamana <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of pratiṣedhadvayena prakṛtagamana:{dgag pa gnyis kyis rnal ma go ba/}\n\nEnglish: “understanding the main [proposition] by means of two negations”, “the law of double-negation elimination”, “comprehending/attaining what is contextually alluded to by means of double negation”, “[the law that] one understands the main [proposition] by means of two negations”)\nTom J. F. Tillemans literally renders the expression as “understanding the main [proposition] by means of two negations”  and less literally as “the law of double-negation elimination.” He also points out (as shown to him by Pascale Hugon) that the Sanskrit expression can be found in the third chapter of Dharmakīrti’s Pramāṇaviniścaya.\nEven when the general meaning of “dgag pa gnyis kyis rnal ma go ba” (as a rendering of pratiṣedhadvayena prakṛtagamana) becomes clear to one, the literal meaning of “rnal ma go ba,” the Tibetan rendering of prakṛtagamana, still seems to remain obscure. It may become a little clearer if one considers the fact that prakṛta in such contexts has been rendered elsewhere as “skabs su bab pa” (e.g. Watanabe 1985: 5) “contextually pertinent” and as “(la) bsnyegs” (e.g. Triṃśikābhāṣya (Skt-Tib): § 1.1.2.1.4.1.1) “alluded to.”  Thus, “dgag pa gnyis kyis rnal ma go ba” may be understood as the “[rule of] comprehending/attaining what is contextually alluded to by means of double negation.”\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:627156

Judging from the paleographical features of the manuscript, Viśuddhirakṣita was active in the 12th century CE.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:631344
jinaz rImitra|Sanskrit: Jinaśrīmitra <Personal Name>\n\n\nJinaśrīmitra is known to us from colophons as the commissioner of five extant Buddhist tantric Sanskrit manuscripts written in Proto-Bengali script. In one of the colophons, the Vikramaśīla monastery is mentioned as the place of copying. This is one of the reasons why it is likely that Jinaśrīmitra was based at this monastery. Possibly, he was acting as a librarian or head of the scriptorium there.\nFrom the above-mentioned colophons, one can also glean that he was a learned monk or monk bearing the title of paṇḍita (paṇḍitabhikṣu). Judging from the paleographical features of the manuscripts commissioned by him, he was active in the 12th century CE.\nApart from these manuscript colophons, the historical sources seem to be almost completely silent about a monk named Jinaśrīmitra. The only possible exception is the seal of someone called ‘Janaśrīmitra’, which was found at the excavated ruins of the monastery of Nālandā. Shastri conjectures a misspelling of ‘Jinaśrīmitra’ here. Since this religious Buddhist name follows a very conventional pattern (one of the common epithets of the Buddha, namely ‘victor’ [jina], is combined with the equally common component śrīmitra), it is unclear – provided that Shastri’s conjecture is correct – whether we are dealing here with our scholar-monk Jinaśrīmitra or simply with another monk bearing the same name.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:631683

In the bsTan ’gyur, several sādhana-s have been attributed to him (Chattopadhyaya and Chimpa 1970: 413). The Sanskrit name Sahajavilāsa found in the Sādhanamālā has been recorded in the PW (consulting the Ms.). The PW, however, also records *Sahajalalita. Schiefner’s German translation of  Tāranātha’s rGya gar chos ’byung published in 1869 employs both Sahajavilāsa (p. 197) and *Sahajalalita (p. 210). As pointed out in Lama 2013: 20, n. 77, Giuseppe Tucci has corrected the name *Sahajalalita (used by Cordier 1909: 296, Lalou 1933: 169–170, 218, Chattopadhyaya and Chimpa 1970: 251, 413) to Sahajavilāsa. The wrong reconstruction *Sahajalalita is already found in a gloss of the dBus pa blo gsal bstan ’gyur dkar chag (no. 8-142). The correct Sanskrit name Sahajavilāsa has been, however, transmitted in the bsTan ’gyur catalogues by Bu ston Rin chen grub and Zhu chen Tshul khrims rin chen (see below “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Tibetan Autochthonous Works.”\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:633613

However, the term acintyaṃ sthānam has, at least in certain contexts, clearly also the connotation of a “thing one should not think about.” This is, for instance, the case, when three such items are listed and defined in the Samāhitā Bhūmiḥ of the Yogācārabhūmi in the discussion of nourishments (āhāra) of doubt (vicikitsā) as a hindrance for entering the absorptions (dhyāna).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:651207

agastya|Sanskrit: Agastya <Personal Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Agastya:{ri 'dor/}, {ri 'phen/}, {nyes 'dor/}\n\n= Agasti “m. (according to, Uṇ. iv, 179 fr. 2.a-ga, a mountain, and asti, thrower, √2. as). N. of a Ṛṣi (author of several Vedic hymns; said to have been the son of both Mitra and Varuṇa by Urvaśī; to have been born in a water-jar; to have been of short stature; to have swallowed the ocean, and compelled the Vindhya mountains to prostrate themselves before him; to have conquered and civilized the South; to have written on medicine, …) … the star Canopus (of which Agastya is the regent, said to be the ‘cleanser of water’, because of turbid waters becoming clean at its rising.”\nAs one can see, the name Agastya has been rendered into Tibetan in at least two ways, namely, (a) Ri ’dor/’phen (Saṃ bod shan sbyar, p. 4) and (b) Nyes ’dor (Vajratuṇḍasamayakalparāja-Tib, B, p. 104.12). The former presupposes the interpretation: Agastya (or Agasti) = aga (“mountain”) + asti (“thrower,” from √as). Thus it has been rendered into Tibetan as Ri ’dor/’phen “Mountain Hurler.” To be sure, a+ga means “not going/moving” and hence “a mountain” (among other things). The latter Tibetan rendering presupposes the following understanding by the translators: Agastya (or Agasti) = āga (i.e. āgas and āga “sin” as in anāga “sinless”) + asti “thrower” (cf. MW, s.v. āgas “transgression, offence, injury, sin, fault”) and thus Nyes ’dor would mean something like “Fault Eliminator/Avoider.” Or, as suggested by Isaacson, Tibetan translators might have taken agas to be āgas “sin” and tya to be √tyaj “to abandon.”\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:663671

mAhAtmyaz arIra|Sanskrit: māhātmyaśarīra <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nEnglish: being with glorious body, having a magnificent body, the magnanimous body, possessor of a body of dignity, the Great Being\nThe term speaks of those divine personalities who by dint of their strong power of will can give rise to various forms of creations. Brahman, or Hiraṇyagarbha, Maheśvara and such other divine beings fall under this category.\nThe māhātmyaśarīrāḥ are a kind of divine beings that come into existence at the beginning of creation. Their bodies are not generated through parents, but are produced from the Pradhānam of themselves (sāṃsiddhikam). While those beings, in whom the Sattva-element predominates, are called Paramarṣis, those in whose body the Rajas-element predominates, are called Māhātmyaśarīras. (…). Just as knowledge (jñānam) is connatural to the Paramarṣis due to the predominance of the Sattva-element in them, supreme power (aiśvaryam), resulting from the predominance of the Rajas-element, is connatural to the Māhātmyaśarīras. (…). Their power seems to consist in being able to bring beings into existence according to their will, just as Maheśvara is said to have created several thousands of Rudras by mere thought or power of will (abhimānam) (…). Brahmā and Hiraṇyagarbha are said to be Māhātmyaśarīras.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:667051

vikramapura|Sanskrit: Vikramapura <Place Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Vikramapura:{bi kra ma'i grong/}\n\nVikramapura ‘was the capital city of the Chandra, Varman, Sena rulers, from the beginning of the 10th century AD to the beginning of the 13th century AD. [...] Today Vikramapura is an extensive region of the Munshiganj district, and at some point of time it extended over some parts of Faridpur across the Padma. However, it must be said that it is difficult to ascertain the exact boundary of the territorial unit of that name’ (http://www.banglapedia.org/httpdocs/ HT/V_0045.HTM, last visited on July 18th, 2012). Many scholars locate ancient Vikramapura in the region of the modern Dacca District, cf., e.g., Majumdar 1943: Appendix V; Sircar 1971: 157; Huntington 1984: 167–170; Wallace 2001: 29.\nMark Tatz (1987: 700) has pointed out that ‘All Tibetan sources seem to conflate Vikramapura with Vikramaśīla’. That Vikramapura and Vikramaśīla are two different places is confirmed by the passage from the Kaiser Library MS 142 cited below.\nVikramapura is sometimes quoted also in non-Buddhist sources, such as the Kathāsaritsāgara and the Hitopadeśa.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:671099
yamAritantramaNDalopAyikA|Sanskrit: Yamāritantramaṇḍalopāyikā <Scripture/Treatise>\n\n\nAn abhiṣeka manual of Yamāri cycle composed by Śrīdhara. In his Sahajālokapañjikā, Śrīdhara refers to a certain Maṇḍalopāyikā which may probably be identified with this manual. The Tibetan Canon transmits two Yamārimaṇḍalopāyikās ascribed to Śrīdhara, i.e., the  *Kṛṣṇayamārimaṇḍalopāyikā (D 1924) and the *Raktayamārimaṇḍalopāyikā (D 2024). Although no work under the title “Yamāritantramaṇḍalopāyikā” is included therein, the Sanskrit version with this title shows a rather close correspondence with the *Kṛṣṇayamārimaṇḍalopāyikā.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:94701
mUlapraNidhAna|Sanskrit: mūlapraṇidhāna <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of mūlapraṇidhāna:{rtsa ba'i smon lam/}\n\nEnglish: root-aspiration\nThe two terms mūlapraṇidhāna and anupraṇidhāna were corrupted in the later transmission of the Mahāvastu in Nepal, and hence in Senart’s edition, into kuśalamūlapraṇidhāna, and anulomapraṇidhāna, thereby blurring the place of these two types of aspiration in the map of the path as conceived in Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravādin circles.\nThe concept matches closely that of ādyapraṇidhāna known to the Vaibhāṣika tradition, and at least one of the meanings of the compound pūrvapraṇidhāna. It may also be compared to that of mahāpraṇidhāna in Mahāyāna scriptures such as the Sukhāvatīvyūha.\nThe Nidānanamaskāra of the Mahāvastu establishes a distinction between the “root-aspiration” (mūlapraṇidhāna) and subsequent aspirations (anupraṇidhāna). The first one marks a bodhisattva’s entry in the praṇidhānacaryā (the second out of four phases in the bodhisattva career) while anupraṇidhāna-s are made during the third phase (anulomacaryā). The mūlapraṇidhāna is the core aspiration, which will define the future buddha-identity of the individual who makes it. His future characteristics will closely match those of the buddha in whose presence he made it. Thus, “our Buddha” Śākyamuni made his root-aspiration in the presence of a former Śākyamuni, bearing the very same characteristics.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:672543

phalayAna|Sanskrit: phalayāna <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of phalayāna:{'bras bu'i theg pa/}\n\nEnglish: Result/Fruit Vehicle\nThe term phalayāna has been flagged (with an asterisk) as not yet attested in Kyuma 2009: 477. There are indeed no occurrences to be found, it seems, in Sanskrit texts that have been published up to now. The two cited from as yet unpublished works below date from no earlier than the eleventh century.\nThe idea of phalayāna may well have been inspired by the idea expressed in Mañjuśrīnāmasaṃgīti 135cd: yānatritayaniryāta ekayānaphale sthitaḥ /.

zAkyamuni|Sanskrit: Śākyamuni <Personal Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Śākyamuni:{shākya thub pa/}\n\nIn later texts related to this tradition, yet another Śākyamuni (preceeding Dīpaṃkara) emerges as the first Buddha in the presence of whom “our Buddha” (asmākaṃ buddhaḥ) conceived his very first aspiration to Buddhahood (variously termed mūlapraṇidhāna, ādyapraṇidhāna, or prathamacittotpāda: see the passages from the Mahāvastu, the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, and the Abhidharmadīpavṛtti below). This former Śākyamuni possessed the exact same characteristics attributed to “our” Śākyamuni. Besides the sources quoted below, note that the Mahāvibhāṣā tells the story of the encounter between the Bodhisattva, then the potter *Prabhāsa (Ch. 廣熾), and his predecessor. See T 1545, vol. XXVII, 891b28–892a5.\nIn still more developed texts on the bodhisattva career, represented for instance by the *Buddhapiṭaka-Duḥśīlanigrahī passage below, our Buddha is said to have honored millions (30 koṭi) of Śākyamuni-s.\nA name assumed by a variety of past buddhas in the Vinaya literature of especially Mahāsāṃghika and Sarvāstivādin milieux, and in some Mahāyāna scriptures concerned with lineages of buddhas and  with the bodhisattva path of the Śākyamuni of our time.\nA predecessor of Śākyamuni bearing the same name is already included in the lineages of 15 to 17 Buddhas transmitted in the old Bahubuddhakasūtra-s. There, he appears as a successor of Dīpaṃkara.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:673705

However, in the Yogācārabhūmi, there is a tendency to interpret the word as an umbrella term for some of the solitary places mentioned in the long canonical list of  places suitable for meditation (see “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Indic” below). This must be the reason why some Tibetan translators prefer to render the term as “free from houses” (khyim gyis stong pa, as if translating an original *āgāraśūnya) in certain contexts. Edgerton’s rendering “solitude” is only justifiable in such or similar exceptional contexts as well. Xuanzang, the Chinese translator of the Yogācārabhūmi, seems to stick to a rendering meaning “empty house” throughout.\n(m. or nt.; = Pali suññāg°), solitary abode, solitude: in phrase bṛṃhayitā (see °yitar) °rāṇām Mvy 2437 (Tib. translates with wooden literalness).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:676831

Obviously, it does not necessarily imply that one is harmed by other creatures. However, the aspect of harming or offending seems to come to the fore in other uses of this word and its cognates.

mohopamA|Sanskrit: mohopamā <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of mohopamā:{rmongs pa'i dpe/}\n\nEnglish: Simile of Illusion, simile of confusion\nan upamā in which the two terms of comparison are confused with one another.\nIn atiśaya upamā [2.22] the similarity between the upameya and upamāna was so great that only a single difference could be discerned. In moha upamā even that minimal distinction dissolves—resulting in total confusion. Which is the face? Which is the moon? Of course the confusion further underlines a conceived identity between the upameya and upamāna, whose common attributes are left to be inferred. And in confusion the relative status of upameya and upamāna blurs—a face so beautiful that it cannot be distinguished from the moon.\nMohopamā springs from the close similarity between the upameya and the upamāna, so close that a rational being would go to the length of actually mistaking the one for the other. This variety is accordingly not only a step in advance of atiśayopamā (where the element of difference was consciously realised) but in advance of rūpaka, where the bheda is completely submerged, though it is there at the back of one’s consciousness so that an actual blunder cannot arise.\nOne of the 32 types of simile (upamā), which, in turn, is the second of the 35 arthālaṃkāra-s in Daṇḍin’s Kāvyādarśa.\n\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:700249

The Tibetan rendering ’tsho ba med pa’i ’jigs pa (see above) fits better to the latter word. Another Tibetan rendering, namely kun tu ’tsho ba’i med pa’i ’jigs pa (see above) seems to confirm our headword  (kun tu = ā°), although the presence of a negation in it fits better to the alpha privativum contained in ajīvikābhaya.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:700320

And where in adbhuta upamā [2.24] there is a hypothesized transfer of features, in saṃśaya upamā comparable features remain distinctive respectively to the upameya and upamāna (‘eyes darting’/‘bees roaming’).

Becasue [sic] he differed from the Sāṁkhya tradition of Kapila down to Pañcaśikha, his chronological position was remembered vaguely and hence his name was differently located in the list of Sāṁkhya teachers. The suggestion of Voḍhu being a senior contemporary of Āsuri is supported by the evidence of the Vāmana Purāṇa which names Sāṁkhya teachers in the sequence of Kapila, Voḍhu and Āsuri.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:751533

In fact, Candragomin’s Śiṣyalekha is said to have been written for Ratnakīrti (see the citation from the rGya gar chos ’byung below). It has been pointed out (in Chattopadhyaya & Chimpa 1970: 27) that the two Indian commentaries, namely, Vairocanarakṣita’s Śiṣyalekhaṭippaṇa and Prajñākaramati’s Śiṣyalekhavṛtti, offer different reasons why Candragomin wrote his Śiṣyalekha. According to the former, Candragomin wrote the Śiṣyalekha to prevent his student Ratnakīrti from going into politics. According to the latter, Candragomin wrote the Śiṣyalekha to dissuade his student (not mentioned by name) from having an affair with a princess. Ratnakīrti also reportedly composed a commentary on Candrakīrti’s Madhyamakāvatāra (Chattopadhyaya & Chimpa 1970: p. 227).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:761708

The central figure of this maṇḍala is Mañjuvajra who has the nature of Vairocana (vairocanasvabhāvo mañjuvajraḥ).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:762765
hevajramaNDala|Sanskrit: hevajramaṇḍala <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of hevajramaṇḍala:{dgyes pa'i rdo rje'i dkyil 'khor/}\n\nFour variants of the 9-deity maṇḍala of Hevajra are given in Abhayākaragupta’s Vajrāvalī and Niṣpannayogāvalī. The difference among these four forms consists mainly in the number of arms—two, four, six, and sixteen—of the central figure.  Note also that the maṇḍala is actually called in the Vajrāvalī “navātmakasya hevajracatuṣṭayasya [maṇḍalam]” while in the Niṣpannayogāvalī “navātmakasya herukasya catuṣṭayasya (read herukacatuṣṭayasya as in Ms N3) maṇḍalam.”\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:762973

All these terms seem to be intended to refer to the shape of the letters, rather than to the countries where they are used. It is hardly possible to guess what the author meant by them, and the woodenly literal Tib. translations give little help; Tib. renders utksepa, gdeg pa, elevation (and āvarta, skor ba, turn); nikṣepa, bzhag pa or bzhog pa, putting down: vikṣepa (which Tib. transposes to the point in line (5 where Lefm.’s ms.

(which however I find obscure). The text continues: yāvad-daśottarapadasaṃdhi-lipiṃ; this time Tib. is rather different, tshig gi mtshams bcur brgyud paḥi bar gyi (yi ge), which Foucaux renders as before (with ten for two); it seems to mean writing up to a series of ten (forming) a combination of words, or writing of combinations of words in which up to ten words follow one another.

az maka|Sanskrit: Aśmaka <Place Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Aśmaka:{rdo can/}\n\nm (pl.) [sa. Aśmaka], an Andhra-tribe (and their country).\nThere is no agreement among scholars about the situation of this ancient country. (See page 277). Aśmaka is identified by some with the Buddhist Assaka situated between the Godāvarī and Māhiṣmatī on the Narmadā and its capital was Pratiṣṭhāna. It was a part of the Mahārāṣṭra country at the time of Aśoka.\nIt is also an old name of Travancore.\nAśmaka appears as a name which can denote a country (janapada) or a kṣatriya (anuvṛtti from Aṣṭādhyāyī 4.1.168) already in Aṣṭādhyāyī\n 4.1.173. It is plausible therefore that this is the older form, with Aśvaka having arisen via  ‘wrong’ Sanskritization of a Middle Indic form such as Assaka.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:821848
az vaka|Sanskrit: Aśvaka <Place Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Aśvaka:{srag pa/}, {sreg pa/}\n\nThere seem to be two regions or countries with the name Aśvaka, namely, one in the north-west, and one in the south. Aśvaka in the sense of one of the sixteen mahājanapada-s is said to be the one in the south. In Buddhist Pāli sources, it is called Assaka (CPD), and in Sanskrit sources Aśmaka as well as Aśvaka (see the next key information by Isaacson). The CPD does record the Sanskrit name Aśmaka but not Aśvaka (in the sense of the name of a mahājanapada). A list of the sixteen mahājanapada-s transmitted via the Tibetan translation of the *Vasiṣṭhasūtra (gNas ’jog gi mdo), translated by sKa ba dPal brtsegs, has already been noted by Dan Martin (https://sites.google.com/site/tibetological/tibet-at-the-center). The list has also been cited in dPal brtsegs’s gSung rab rin po che’i gtam. The difficulty with the list found in Tibetan sources is identifying the proper Sanskrit names. One such name that poses a difficulty is “Sreg pa.” This is clearly a translation and not a phonetic transcription. In the *Vasiṣṭhasūtra (gNas ’jog gi mdo), it is spelled “Sreg pa,” whereas in the  gSung rab rin po che’i gtam, it is spelled “Srag pa.” As for the Sanskrit name, according to Negi’s dictionary, “Aśmaka,” as one of the mahājanapada-s, has been rendered into Tibetan as “rDo can.” It also appears that “Sreg pa” is a rendering of Aśvaka. Aśvaka is supposed to mean something like “a small or bad horse” or “a toy-horse” (MW). Tibetan “sreg pa” (according to Jäschke 1881) means a “partridge” (cf. also brDa dkrol gser gyi me long, s.v. srag pa: bya bye brag pa zhig gi ming; also note Jäschke’s remark on the Western-Tibetan pronunciation of sreg pa: “W. *s̀rag-pa*”). In the Tshig mdzod chen mo (s.v. gong ma sreg), the bird is referred to as “bya sreg pa,” a bird which is said to be similar to a “bya gong mo” (also called “lha bya gong mo” or “spang bya sreg pa”). Some sources identify it to be a “grouse” (Jäschke 1881: s.v. gong mo). But can Aśvaka mean a certain kind of bird? MW does state that Aśvaka also means a “sparrow,” though attested only lexically (L), but this might have been the basis for the Tibetan rendering “Sreg pa.” Old Tibetan documents (e.g. Pelliot tibétain 1285) do allude to “bya’ sreg pa.”\nAśmaka appears as a name which can denote a country (janapada) or a kṣatriya (anuvṛtti from Aṣṭādhyāyī 4.1.168) already in Aṣṭādhyāyī\n 4.1.173.

bhadrapaNa|Sanskrit: Bhadrapaṇa <Personal Name>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of Bhadrapaṇa:{rgyan bzang po/}\n\nOf the four or five Indian commentaries in Tibetan translation on the Bhadracarī, the *Bhadracarīpraṇidhānarājaṭīkā is ascribed to one Indian author whose Sanskrit name has been rendered into Tibetan as “rGyan bzang po.” Whether he and Śākyamitra each composed a separate ṭīkā or whether they co-authored one ṭīkā seems worth investigating. The name in Tibetan is well attested in some of the earliest catalogues and other textual witnesses and hence it is not an issue here. Already in 1912, in his German dissertation on the Bhadracarī, Kaikioku Watanabe (Watanabe 1912: 23) reconstructed the name as (Vi)bhūṣaṇabhadra or Alaṃkārabhadra. But he was cautious. He conceded: “The exact form of the name of the author remains undetermined because the name is otherwise unknown” (“Die genaue Form des Verfassernamens bleibt unbestimmt, weil er sonst unbekannt ist”). Dan Martin in his Tibskrit has reconstructed “rGyan bzang po” as *Subhūṣita. However, in the same Tibskrit, Martin records “Bhadrapaṇa” to which he adds “Author of a commentary on the Bzang po spyod pa’i smon lam. It’s listed as no. 5515 in the Peking Tanjur. Schaik, Prayer, p. 185” (i.e. van Schaik 2009: 185). In Herrmann-Pfandt 2008: 319, the bZang po spyod pa’i smon lam (P 5515) in question here has already been identified as the *Bhadracarīpraṇidhānarājaṭīkā by “rGyan bzang po.” There is a remark in German (“Identifikation eindeutig”). The Sanskrit name of the author is given as Bhadrāpaṇa in Herrmann-Pfandt 2008: 319, without any further comment. The bilingual name has been indexed (pp. 466, 472) and the orthography of the name in Sanskrit is consistently Bhadrāpaṇa. The question is how can we explain the correspondence between the Sanskrit and Tibetan forms of the name. There is no difficulty with bhadra and bzang po. Presumably those who proposed the name bhadrāpaṇa understood as  bhadra + āpaṇa. The second component of the name cannot possibly be apaṇa. But can āpaṇa mean rgyan? According to MW (s.v. āpaṇa), it means “a market, a shop,” “waves” or “commerce, trade” (only recorded in lexicons). But there seems to be no element that could correspond to Tibetan rgyan in this word. And does the Tibetan word really mean “ornament” or “ornamented” as the earlier attempts of reconstruction presupposed? But before we answer this, let us consider the orthography Bhadrapaṇa that Martin gives based on van Schaik 2009: 185. In fact, we already find Bhadrapaṇa for rGyan bzang po in de la Vallée Poussin 1962 (p. 56). According to MW (s.v. paṇa), it can mean “paṇa m. (ifc. f(ā).) play, gaming, playing for a stake, a bet or a wager (with gen.; loc. or ifc.; paṇaṃ√kṛ, to make a bet; paṇe ni√as, to stake at play),” “the thing staked or the sum played for, wages, hire, reward.” But the question is whether such a meaning could agree with the meaning of the Tibetan word rgyan? In fact, it can. According to Jäschke 1881 (s.v. rgyan, II1–2), rgyan can, as a noun, mean “a stake or pledge at play” and “lot” and in a verbal construction (as in rgyan btsugs/rgyab) it can mean “to bet” or “to wager.” This is also confirmed by the Tshig mdzod chen mo (s.v. rgyan 2): rgyal dang skugs, ... sho sbag brgyab nas rgyan rgyal ba, ... dngul zong ci rigs kyi rgyan ’gyed pa, ... shing bu dang, rde’u sogs bsgrugs te rgyan rgyag pa, ... rgyal pham thob shor gyi ched du rgyan ’phen pa, ... rtsed mo thob shor gyi ched du dngul ’bor chen rgyan du btsugs pa. Thus I propose that the word rgyan in the name “rGyan bzang po” means something like “bet” or “lot,” and that the Sanskrit name probably was Bhadrapaṇa, and meant something like “Good Bet” or “Good Lot,” or, as a bahuvrīhi, “With a Good Lot/Stake.”\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:846053

This word has not been found in Tibetan dictionaries under any of the spellings listed below. It is attested in the Siddhasāra as a rendering of Sanskrit kāśmarya in the following readings: \nSi 2.15 taṃ-bal P] ti-pa-la D, ti-pal N\nSi 3.2212 taṃ-bal DN] taṃ-pa P\nSi 5.95 btaṅ-pal N] btaṅ-pa-la DP\nSi 5.102 ta-pal NP] ta-pa-la D\nSi 7.24 taṃ-pa P] taṃ-pa-la D, taṃ-bal N\nSi 27.13 taṃ-ba-la D] taṃ-pal N, rtam pal P\nSi 28.12 taṃ-pa-la DNP\nAs a rendering of Sanskrit kāśmarī it is attested as follows: \nSi 2.25 taṃ-pal P] ti-bal DN\nSi 5.34 taṃ-pal NP]  taṃ-pa-la D\nSi 5.62 taṃ-pal P]  taṃ-pa-la D, taṃ-bal N\nSi 6.24 taṃ-bal P] taṃ-pa-la D, taṃ-pal N\nSimilar renderings of Sanskrit kāśmarya are found in the Tibetan version of Vāgbhaṭa’s Ah: \nSu. 1.5.11 taṅ-pal D 78a2; P 52a3\nUtt.34.28 taṅ-pal D 312a5 : taṅ-bal P 295b2\nUtt.36.60 taṅ-pal D318b3 : taṅ-bal P 302b7\nIn the Tibetan version of the Amarakośa on the other hand only «etymological» renderings are given. AK 2.4.35 gsal byed (46bl) for kāśmarī and AK 2.4.36 snaṅ-ldan (46bl) for kāśmarya. gsal-bar byed-pa is known to render Sanskrit prakāśate (Lokesh Chandra). The variety of spellings points to this word being a loanword and since kāśmarya is generally identified as Gmelina arborea Roxb. (Kirtikar and Basu, III, 1932–4; G. J. Meulenbeld, The Mādhavanidāna, Leiden 1974, 543) «white teak», a purely Indian tree, an Indian origin should be sought. Unless it is a complete corruption of Sanskrit gambhārī, a synonym of kāśmarya, no suitable Indian source has yet been found. The Khotanese version of the Siddhasāra has kaśmīrye at all three occurrences: 2.15,25 3.22.12 (Chii.002.12r4,14rl and 19rl). It is remarkable that the Khotanese has kaśmīrye also to render Sanskrit śrī-parṇī, said by Siddhasāra-nighaṇṭu 71 to be synonymous with kāśmarī, whereas the Tibetan does not once use taṃ-bal but always a transcription of śrī-parṇī. In the Siddhasāra śrī-parṇī occurs at 2.7,24,28\n 5.35,53. The last two places are not extant in Khotanese. śrī-parṇī seldom occurs in Vāgbhata’s Ah. At Utt. 20.12 we find a transcription: śi-ri parṇi (D 285a4), śi-dri-par-ni (P 264a5). The use of kaśmīrye in Khotanese suggests that Tibetan bal may be intended to mean «Nepalese» but one would expect bal to be the first element of the compound rather than the second.\nm.

Gmelina arborea, nepali khamāro, khamāri, gambhāri Gmelina arborea (und weitere ni. Wörter, teilweise unsicherer Zuweisung: Tu 3082). - Unklar; vielleicht Fremdwort. Die ved. Form wirkt wie ein Erbwort (von *kārṣmar- ~ kā́rṣman-[?]) kann aber Archaisierung eines Fremdwortes von mi. Erscheinung sein. Nicht zu sichern ist, daß kā° aus der Vorform dravidischer Wörter wie kan. kumuḷe, kumbuḍi, kūḷe ‘Gmelina arborea’ (u.a., DED2 159a) stamme (woraus wohl Lex. kumudā-); Lit. in KEWA I 202.

cimicimA|Sanskrit: cimicimā <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of cimicimā:{tsag tsag/}\n\ncimicimā f. pricking, Aṣṭâṅg. i.\ntsag-tsag is found in the dictionaries of Chos-kyi grags-pa and Sumatiratna, but it is helpful to draw attention to its use in bilingual texts. It is evidently a derivative of gtsag-pa «to pierce, prick» recorded by Das. Another derivative is btsags-bu, which is described by Jäschke as a «lancet for bleeding», btsags-bu (btsags N, gtsags D, btsag P) occurs in Si 26.88 as a rendering of Sanskrit śastra, which is used there of an instrument for piercing pimples in the throat. The Khotanese has (156v3) prriharaṃ jsa «with a praharaṇa», the usual Khotanese rendering of Sanskrit śastra. Si 26.81 concerns the characteristics of tongue disease that has arisen due to bile. They are: lce rtsub-cing tsha-ba hur-hur-por ’dug-la tsag-tsag tsha-ba «the tongue is rough, there is gentle warmth, and it has hot pricks». This is a rendering of Sanskrit sa-dāhaiḥ kaṇṭakaiḥ «with hot prickles». The Khotanese omits the prickles altogether and has biśā’-v-ī ysīrrä hame u ttaudā-v-ī va hame «one’s tongue becomes rough and warmth arises for one». tsag-tsag is attested in the Tibetan version of Vāgbhaṭa’s Ah, Su.10.5. There we find to render udvejayati jihvāgraṃ kurvaṃś cimicimāṃ kaṭur, which is translated by Hilgenberg and Kirfel: «die scharfe (Geschmacksqualität) lässt dadurch, dass sie Prickeln hervorruft, die Zungenspitze emporzucken», in the Tibetan version tsha-ba lce-rtse skye byed-cing [//] tsag-tsag byed-par ’gyur-ba dang [//] «the pungent (taste) makes the tip of the tongue extend and pricking is caused (by it)». Thus, tsag-tsag corresponds to Sanskrit cimicimā «pricking». Indu comments: cimicimām agnijvālā-saṃparśam iva karoti «it causes pricking like contact with the flame of a fire».\nCf. “°yate, to prick, Car. i, 18.”\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:879451

(cf. buddhaiḍūka)., A wall &c. of bones and rubbish.\nAccording to Amarasiṁha (AmK 2.2(pura-varga).4a2b), an eḍūka is a walled structure in which bones are deposited (eḍūkaṃ yad-antar-nyasta-kîkasam /). The best discussion of the terms eḍūka/aiḍūka to date is Bakker (2007); see also Allchin (1957). Contrary to the aiḍūka (for which the locus classicus is Viṣṇu-dharmôttara-purāṇa 3.84.1–15, quoted and discussed in Bakker (2007: 12, n. 4, and 12–13)), which did not contain any physical remnants of the dead, eḍūkas can be defined as ‘[b]urial mounds or sepulchral monuments that actually contain the ashes and/or bones of the deceased’ (2007: 19); for a physical description, see Bakker (2007: 43). According to Bakker (2007: 40), ‘we may take it for certain that the author of the VDhP calqued his Hindu aiḍūka on a Buddhist example [see already Bakker (2007: 13–14)—V.E.], but by doing this he elaborated on what must have been a monumental tradition that was common to all Indian religions, most pronounced within Buddhism, less in Jainism and inconspicuous in the Hindu mainstream.’ Referring to the Mahā-bhārata passage under consideration, Bakker (2007: 33, n. 76) quotes Allchin (1957: 1) (‘Since Lassen it has been generally accepted that this description of the Kali-yuga refers to the spread of Buddhist practices and the popular desertion of Brahmanical temples.’), and adds: ‘This is not to say, however, that the composer of this passage was exclusively thinking of Buddhism. He might have lashed out at all pan-Indian practices frowned upon by the orthodox that involved the erection of monuments over mortuary remains. Eḍūka thus seems to be a wider term than, for instance, stūpa, and it clearly has here, if not in all cases where it occurs, a pejorative connotation.’\nelaka, m.

akuz aladharma|Sanskrit: akuśaladharma <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of akuśaladharma:{mi dge ba'i chos/}\n\nEnglish: unwholesome state, unwholesome quality, unwholesome thought, unwholesome factor, state that is bad, bad character, pl. bad qualities\n2.1. As far as I can see, kuśala and akuśala as adjectives qualifying dharmas are only very rarely used with exclusive or primary reference to the secular level. As an exception, one can, perhaps, adduce a passage near the beginning of the Sanskrit Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra, where the kuśalā dharmāḥ which according to the Buddha will flourish and not decrease among the Vṛjis as long as certain social patterns of behavior are maintained most probably do not refer to moral or religious qualities (which would be beneficial from the karmic and spiritual perspective) but rather to a fortunate, secure, and unassailable economic and political situation. These aspects of secular welfare are, however, by no means detrimental to moral and spiritual growth, and it is hard to imagine that in any Buddhist text an action or attitude that yields profit in this life but entails evil consequences in the afterlife or is spiritually detrimental would be qualified as kuśala.\n 2.2. Not infrequently, however, the texts point out that dharmas that are (or may be) qualified as kuśala and akuśala in the karmic or spiritual perspective tend to have, respectively, agreeable and disagreeable consequences already in the present life as well. Successfully cultivated spiritual practices, e.g., and especially the various levels of deep meditation, are described as involving a state of non-sensual happiness and equanimity, and keeping the moral precepts not only leads to rebirth in heaven after death but is often described as also entailing happiness in this very life because one is free from contrition and feels at ease among people or in meetings, receives social approval, enjoys economic success due to non-negligence, runs no risk of being punished, and dies a peaceful death. As against this, breaking the moral precepts tends to have the opposite effects. As the Yogācārabhūmi puts it, a person deciding and attempting to kill someone else may succeed in doing so or may fail. In the first case, he will in any case experience painful retribution in the afterlife,  but he may also incur punishment or reproach in the present life. Even if he is unsuccessful, he may incur punishment or reproach in this life or at least suffer from frustration because his attempt failed.\nIt should be noted that instead of the compound akuśaladharma (as well as the opposite kuśaladharma), in primary sources we often find the two basic words uncompounded and in the plural. See, for instance, references in SWTF to texts found in Turfan where the word akuśala occurs in connection with the word dharma, usually not in compound and in the plural.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:897405

parivrATkAmukaz van|Sanskrit: parivrāṭkāmukaśvan <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of parivrāṭkāmukaśvan:{kun rgyu chags can khyi/}\n\nThe verse Bodhicittavivaraṇa 20 (see the first Occurrence in Primary Sources: Indic below) giving kuṇapa (corpse), kāminī (passionate woman/lover), and bhakṣya (food) as examples of three different perceptions of different subjects, namely an ascetic or bhikṣu (parivrāṭ), a (male) lover (kāmuka), and a dog (śvan) regarding the same object (the body of a woman), has been cited in various works of various genres (a citation in the Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha has been noted by Hahn 1990: 16 and Lindtner 1997: 251). This example, with the same Sanskrit words for the perceptions but without the words for the subjects (so without the headword or the components thereof), was already given by Dharmakīrti in Pramāṇavārttika Svavṛtti ad Pramāṇavārttika Svārthānumāna 58. The basic idea, but without this specific example, can be found already in Āryadeva’s Catuḥśataka\n 8.2 and even before that in Aśvaghoṣa’s Saundarananda 13.62.

AgArika|Sanskrit: āgārika <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of āgārika:{khyim so/}, {khyim pa/}\n\nEnglish: belonging to a house; living in a house; a householder; a housewife; a lay person, belonging to the household life; the occupations of a householder\n(m., perh. also adj.; = Pali id., see CPD s.v. agārika, a form not noted in BHS), householder, one living in worldly life: Divy 275.17 na bhikṣuṇā āgārikasya purastād ṛddhir vidarśayitavyā; MSV i.248.19; in Bbh 26.13, in comp., pravrajitasya āgārika-vicitra-vyāsaṅga-duḥkha-nirmokṣāt, could be either n., householder, or adj., of the householder’s life.\nWhile in Pali we have both a noun (usually agārika, though with the variant reading āgārika attested) and an adjective (āgārika) attested, in Sanskrit an adjective āgārika is of uncertain attestation (cf. BHSD quoted above), and for the noun only the orthography āgārika seems to be reliably citable.\nThe term agārika is discussed also in Tournier 2020: “One may think of the term agārika, derivative in -ika from agāra. However, as also prescribed by Pāṇini (AA 4.7.70) agārika only occurs at the end of compounds in the sense of a person appointed to a particular ‘chamber.’ See NWS, s.v. agārika.”\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:908907

For instance, in the colophon of the Dhammapadaṭṭhakathā, we simply read dhammapadassa aṭṭhavaṇṇanā niṭṭhitā (ed. PTS vol. 4, p. 234; cf. also von Hinüber 1996: 132). A more elaborate colophon can be read at the end of the sīlakkhandhavagga of the Dīghanikāyaṭṭhakathā, where we read iti sumaṅgalavilāsiniyā dīghanikāyaṭṭhakathāyaṃ tevijjasuttavaṇṇanā niṭṭhitā / niṭṭhitā ca terasasuttapaṭimaṇḍitassa sīlakkhandhavaggassa atthavaṇṇanāti / sīlakkhandhavaggaṭṭhakathā niṭṭhitā / (Chattasangayana ed. 1.559).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:912530

The set of 24 conditions to which it belongs is evidently a feature of Theravāda Abhidhamma which lacks a parallel in the Abhidharma texts preserved in Sanskrit.

Cf. a-dveḷhaka.\nSanskrit dictionaries which contain the headword (including the EDSHP) only give it as an adjective. Theoretically it could be either adjective (as a bahuvrīhi) or a noun (as a nañtatpuruṣa). The occurrence in the Mahābhārata quoted under Occurrences in Indic Sources below is ambiguous, but we find it rather natural to take it as a noun. The CPD on the other hand says that Pali advejjha can be either adjective or noun; most occurrences are adjective, but in advejjhagāmin it is reasonable to take advejjha as a noun. PED and Cone report only the adjective form, though in the latter dvejjha is explained as either a noun or as an adjective. PED reports the alternative form adejjha as a noun.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:919461

The Sanskrit word adhītyasamutpanna has occasionally been used by modern scholars, but it appears to be a modern calque upon or proposed equivalent of Pali adhiccasamuppanna.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:919685

It seems never to appear in the lists of ‘perfections’ (pāramitā) in Sanskrit texts. In those lists, the closest correspondent to Pali adhiṭṭhānapāramī is praṇidhipāramitā or praṇidhānapāramitā (cf., e.g., Dayal 1932: 168).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:920422

The words adhiśīlam etc. were orig. adverbs (adhi governing the second member, in a manner referring to…) and are still so used, e.g. Bbh 373.20--21 adhiśīlaṃ (and adhicittaṃ, adhiprajñaṃ) śikṣā; loc. forms are also used in the same way, as adhicitte ca āyogaḥ Ud xxxii.27(32) = Pali Dnp. 185 (same text). These forms may be turned into adjectives: adhiśīlo vihāro Bbh 335.1; sa vihāraḥ adhicitta ity ucyate Bbh 338.21 (this usage seems not recorded in Pali). Often the stems adhiśīla-, adhicitta-, adhiprajña- are used as prior members of cpds., in which case precise analysis becomes difficult; so Bbh 185.14; 333.2; 335.3; 338.24; 341.8; etc. But sometimes adhiprajñā-śikṣā is used as a cpd., Dharmas 140, the prior member being then evidently taken as stem of a noun. As nouns, adhiśīla, adhicitta, and adhiprajñā, like their Pali equivalents, are used Mvy 930--2; Bbh 317.2 (parallel with adhimuktiḥ), being then reinterpreted (with adhi = adhika) as superior morality, intellect, wisdom, see CPD s.vv. adhisīla, °citta, °paññā[.]\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:920441

adhipAtimokkhe|Sanskrit: adhipātimokkhe <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nEnglish: regarding the (code of) discipline, concerning the code of discipline\nadhi-pātimokkhe, ind., regarding the (code of) discipline; MN II 245,17 (ajjhājīve + (q.v.); Ps).\nAnother hypothesis is that adhipātimokkhe (and ajjhājīve) is not indeclinable. It would refer to finer levels of pātimokkha and should thus be considered as a seventh vibhatti like the pair magge and paṭipadāya of the Sāmagāmasutta (for which see below, “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Indic”). This other possibility is supported by the Papañcasūdanī ad loc (for which see s.v. adhipātimokkha, “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Indic”), which distinguishes between basic precepts and all the other ones: the Sāmagāmasutta would claim that disputes on ajjhājīva and adhipātimokkha are not too important (appamattaka) compared with disputes on the path and the way, as they concern subtler rules and not the foundations.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:922455

Buddhaschaft schnell erreichbar, in manchen Fällen, sogar (bei sehr intensiver Praxis), innerhalb eines Lebens. Oft wird Vajrayāna, ‘Diamant-Fahrzeug,’ genannt, trotzdem ist damit impliziert daß sie nicht zum Mahāyāna gehört!\nAs attested in many tantric sources, the terms Mantrayāna, Mantranaya, Mantranīta, and Mantramārga are employed interchangeably.\nThe term mantranaya is one of the oldest and best attested designations of tantric Mahāyāna Buddhism, often paired with pāramitānaya for non-Tantric Mahāyāna. Naturally enough (since naya and nīti will in normal usage often be synonymous), mantranīti is a common synonym. Mantrayāna is an even more common synonym, sometimes paired with pāramitāyāna. Mantramārga is also used as a synonym, though it is noticeably of rarer occurrence than mantranaya and mantranīti. The order of frequency of use of these terms in Buddhist literature seems to be mantranaya, mantrayāna, mantranīti, mantramārga. Note that in Śaiva literature mantramārga is the most common designation of the Tantric form of Śaivism, while mantranaya, mantranīti, and mantrayāna are virtually unattested. Of these four terms, only mantramārga is current (though much less common than in Śaiva texts) in Vaiṣṇava Pāñcarātra tantric literature.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:946890
antara|Sanskrit: antara <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of antara:{mthang gos/}\n\nEnglish: an inner garment, esp. the innermost of the three robes of a Buddhist bhikkhu or bhikkhunī, a between garment or inner (cloak), the middle robe (of the three robes of a bhikkhu).\n5 inner or lower (garment) vāso ’ham antaraṃ paridhatte BhārŚS. x. 4. 3; BhārGS. 2.20 (52.16); 2.21 (54.2); ĀpaGS. v.12.8; sarveṣām atha paridhānāni kṣaumaṃ vā śāṇaṃ vāntaram JaimiGS.\n 1.2 (12.12); vastram antaram eṣāṃ ta ime vastrāntarāḥ MahāBh. i.90.24 (on i.1.28); antarāḥ śāṭakāḥ JaineVyā 10.24 (on i.1.42); antare antarā vā śāṭakāḥ/ paridhānīyā ity arthaḥ SiddhāKau. 51B.6 (on i.1.36).\nantarā, f., an outer(!) garment (cf. antara, n. & antarīya, n.); ~ā + uttarīyaṁ uttarāsaṅgo upasaṁvyānan ti pariyāyasaddā ete, Vv-a 166,28 (cf. Abh 292); — ifc. v. instr, pl. pīt’-antarāhi, Vv 403 (= pītavaṇṇehi uttariyehi(l), Vv-a).\nAs may be seen from the Modern Renderings above (and from a perusal of the occurrences below), there is apparently some disagreement and some confusion about whether the antara/antarā/antarīya/antarīyaka (and also the upasaṃvyāna, incidentally) is an inner (as one would rather expect, from the derivational/etymological meaning of antara), outer, or middle garment (or even a lower one instead, in the sense of covering the lower part of the body).  It may be possible that this confusion is related to a possible ambiguity of adhaḥ as ‘lower’ in the sense of worn beneath another garment (i.e. ‘inner’) or as ‘lower’ in the sense of covering the lower part of the body; note that the meaning given in the Amarakośa  for antarīya (and upasaṃvyāna and paridhāna, treated as synonyms thereof) is adhoṃśuka.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:947728

z IghrayAna|Sanskrit: śīghrayāna <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of śīghrayāna:{theg pa myur ba dang ldan pa/}, {myur ba'i theg pa/}\n\nEnglish: “being in … the quick path”\nn. (also pl.) rapid motion, MBh. …  mfn. moving rapidly, Kām.\n1. śīghrayāna n. rascher Gang, rasches Fahren Mbh. 3, 2638. 2749 (pl.). …\n 2. śīghrayāna adj. = śīghraga Kām. Nītis. 19, 16.\nThe occurrences of this term, in non-Buddhist and Buddhist texts, can be classified thus. The second member of the compound is fundamentally a neuter noun formed from the root yā with the suffix lyuṭ which could denote “vehicle,” “path,” or  “(the action of) going.” The entire compound can then either be a karmadhāraya (giving the possible meanings “swift going,”  “swift vehicle,” or “swift path,” though here “swift” would have to be understood  in a secondary sense such as “which can be swiftly traversed”), or a bahuvrīhi adjective (giving the possible meanings “whose going/movement is swift,” “whose vehicle is swift,” or “whose path is swift,” in which case again “swift” would have to be understood in a secondary sense). Of these  theoretical, and perfectly natural, possibilities, the meanings “swift vehicle” and “swift path” seem so far not to be attested in Sanskrit texts.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:956112

The term mudrā literally means ‘seal,’ ‘stamp’ or the ‘impression or mark left by a seal,’ and thus also ‘image,’ ‘sign,’ or ‘token.’ In the context of religious rituals, prescribed gestures often accompany mantras, and thereby function as a support for the mantric power or as a guarantee of their efficacy. These mudrā-s or gestures may have their origin in mnemonic techniques employed by reciters of the Veda, and so readily serve as a means of evoking an idea in the mind as well as symbolizing various things, such as certain powers or deities. The term mudrā, like vidyā (rig ma), is also used with reference to the female partner of a deity or a practitioner.\nmudrā – nirukti given in the Mitapadā Pañjikā of Durjayacandra (ad 2.4.101): modyate pramodyate yogī yoginī vānayeti mudrā /.

For others, he is a stupid person, for a man favoured by kings (deva being glossed by īśvara) does not undergo a strict training. La Vallée Poussin mentions other passages cited by the Japanese editor of the Kośa in which the understanding “stupid person” (“sot”) is adopted for devānāmpriya, but also gives two other explanations, namely, (i) the term designates somebody who is rich, but is applied ironically to poor people; (ii) the term should be interpreted as a karmadhāraya, and deva as a stupid person; the compound thus designates someone who loves stupid persons, i.e., is himself stupid. According to La Vallée Poussin, in Patañjali’s time it was a royal title that tended to be used ironically, as in Patañjali’s dialogue between the coachman and the grammarian.\nConsidered by Kātyāyana to constitute an exception to Pāṇini’s rule (vi.3.ii) according to which a compound whose first term is in the genitive is unacceptable.

universal|Sanskrit: jāti <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of jāti:{rigs/}\n\nAccording to Halbfass, the term jāti originated in Naiyāyika philosophy. It is not wholly exchangeable with sāmānya, another term for universal not much used in the earliest Nyāya writings. The term jāti is usually considered there narrower in scope than sāmānya, and as applying to something akin to natural species. In the time of “classical Nyāya the uses of jāti and sāmānya tend to coincide” (Halbfass 1992: 121).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:98787

self-occurring gnosis|Sanskrit: \n\nTibetan renderings of :{rang byung gi ye shes/}\n\nThe term svayaṃbhūjñāna as such occurs already in earlier Indian literature, but commonly in the original meaning of the term, namely, the “gnosis of a self-occurring one” or “autogenous gnosis.” In later Buddhist literature, however, the term often occurs in the sense of intrinsic, self-occurring gnosis. The concept of svayaṃbhūjñāna is central to the doctrines of the rNying-ma school of Tibetan Buddhism. However, while some rNying-ma scholars, such as Mi-pham, understand self-occurring gnosis to be a cognitive entity, others, such as Rong-zom-pa, understand it in the sense of the dharmadhātu.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:2579

universal|Sanskrit: sāmānyalakṣaṇa <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of sāmānyalakṣaṇa:{spyi'i mtshan nyid/}\n\nThe two terms svalakṣaṇa (particular) and sāmānyalakṣaṇa (universal) play a central role in the Buddhist logico-epistemological school initiated by Dignāga.  They are closely tied to both the epistemological and ontological theories that define this school.  Ontologically, the particular is what is real, with reality defined as being capable of producing an effect.  This implies, at least since Dharmakīrti, that any particular must be momentary.  Its momentariness, furthermore, implies that it is spatially and temporally unique.  This commits this group of Buddhists to the position that the common objects of everyday experience are just a continuum (santāna) of moments in a causal nexus with each other.  \n\nThe universal is defined as what is other than a particular, and, hence, what does not exist in reality as defined above.  A universal is whatever is experienced (by unawakened beings) as persisting throughout time.  This category includes all the objects of normal experience, as well as anything that causes a cognition of things as the same (a central point of contention in the philosophical debate with the realist schools of India). \n\nEpistemologically, the particular and the universal are aligned with the two sources of knowledge accepted by these Buddhists: perception takes a particular as its object, and inference a universal.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:101484

In this context, it is an alternative term for ṣaḍaṅgayoga (see respective quotation below). In descriptions of the insight-gnosis initiation, the semen (bodhicitta) is said to be imagined as gnosis nectar. Moreover, in a less specific sense, it is occasionally applied to the five nectars (pañcāmṛta).

By decoding those often enigmatic verses, ‘devinettes’ to borrow André Padoux’s expression, the practitioner reconstructs the mantra.\nOccasionally, it is indicated as one of the ten fields of competence for a Tantric officiant of the Higher Tantras (daśatattva).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:109926

First, it is used non-technically or non-terminologically in the sense of the generation of any kind of thought. It is perhaps in this sense that the word is used in non/pre-Mahāyāna sources. Second, in the Mahāyāna sources, it appears to be used mainly in the technical sense of bodhicittotpāda (“generation of the resolve to [attain the highest state of] awakening”).

The Fourth [Initiation]|Sanskrit: caturtha <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of caturtha:{bzhi pa/}\n\nAlso referred to as caturthābhiṣeka and caturthaseka (q.vv.). The somewhat cryptical last pāda of Guhyasamājatantra 18.113 (cited below) became the locus classicus for the postulation of a fourth initiation, giving rise to controversial discussion among exegetes during the centuries. Some of the major arguments within this controversy are recorded for instance in Sujayaśrīgupta’s Abhiṣekanirukti. Among exegetical traditions that accept a “Fourth,” a mainstream interpretation has become established in the sense of an oral transmission by the Guru.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:59838
insight-gnosis initiation|Sanskrit: \n\nTibetan renderings of :{shes rab ye shes dbang bskur ba/}\n\nThe earliest scriptural attestation of the term prajñājñāna as the name of an abhiṣeka is apparently to be found in the Samājottara (note that in the older parts of the Guhyasamāja it is not mentioned). The fact that in the higher Tantric systems the prajñājñāna consecration came to be a primary condition for entry into the Tantric path, and that it involves the initiand’s sexual union with a female consort gave rise to considerable amount of scholarly discourse with regard to potential infringements of or conflicts with monastic vows. Extensive discussions in exegetical literature reflect its continued importance in the Higher Tantras, overshadowed only by the establishment of a “Fourth” consecration which came to be frequently regarded as a further culmination. Specific explanations as to the function of the prajñājñānābhiṣeka are rare in relevant literature; a couple of alternative explanatory models are provided in Jinasujayaśrīgupta’s Abhiṣekanirukti (see occurrences below).\nNote that prajñājñānaseka and prajñājñāna are used in the same sense.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:118914

path of seeing|Sanskrit: darśanamārga <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of darśanamārga:{mthong lam/}, {mthong ba'i lam/}\n\nThe Path of Vision (or Insight) (darśanamārga, mthoṅ lam) is the first immediate and truly adequate full comprehension of Truth by a given person, or arising in a given stream of personality. It is the phase which for the first time eradicates Defilements (kleśa, ñon moṅs), or Obstacles (āvaraṇa, sgrib pa), though, it is true, not yet all of them.

cessation|Sanskrit: nirodha <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of nirodha:{ʼgag pa/}, {ʼgog pa/}\n\nThe word nirodha is very common in Sanskrit, but also has certain technical meanings in Buddhism. As the third Noble Truth (āryasatya), the term nirodha refers to the goal of soteriological practice, i.e. nirvāṇa, the cessation of all suffering or unsatisfactoriness (duḥkhanirodha).\n\nAccording to some Tibetan sources, the two types of nirodha, namely, pratisaṃkhyānirodha and apratisaṃkhyānirodha, which are by definition asamskṛtadharma-s, are counted among the seven elements that belong to the dharmadhātu (chos khams bdun), which are the objects of mental perception. This is in accordance with the Abhidharma (i.e. Sarvāstivāda) tradition that presupposes three asamskṛtadharma-s, the other four being vedanāskandha, saṃskāraskandha, saṃjñāskandha, and avijñaptirūpa. For the Abhidharmasamuccaya tradition, the two types of nirodha belong to the group of  sixteen  elements that make up the dharmadhātu (i.e. five kinds of special rūpa, vedanāskandha, saṃskāraskandha, saṃjñāskandha, and eight kinds of asamskṛtadharma-s which include the two types of nirodha).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:18466

This term occurs alone and also as a member of a compound; it is sometimes replaced (also due to metrical requirements) by periphrastic expressions like prāptābhiṣeka (e.g. in the Pañcakrama, Subhāṣitasaṃgraha, Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati, and Tantrāloka), abhiṣekaprāpta (e.g. the Samādhirājasūtra and Akṣayamatinirdeśa), labdhābhiṣeka (e.g. the Svayaṃbhūpurāṇa, Lalitavistara, and Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa), and abhiṣekalabdha (e.g. the Ratnagotravibhāga and Yogaratnamālā). Sometimes texts describe the advantages deriving from being ‘initiated’; these advantages consist in protection (see e.g. the passage from the Jñānasiddhi cited below) and recognition (see e.g. the passages from Vajrāmṛtatantra and Hevajratantrapiṇḍārthaṭīkā cited below).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:35309

The second passage refers to the abandonment of the fourth viparyāsa, i.e. the wrong conception of a Self with regard to what is not (or not endowed with) Self, by the practitioner, here technically called dharmānudarśin, who sees, that is to say contemplates, the dharma-s according to their true nature (see occurrences below).\nIn the Śrāvakabhūmi the two words are also used with a more technical meaning, referring to the first two ways in which a real object should be considered and examined. The text also describes with more details and according to the typical taxonomical explanations the three and five ways in which a svalakṣaṇa and a sāmānyalakṣaṇa should respectively be seen (see occurrences below).\nIn epistemological treatises the two terms are used to refer to the “particular” and the “universal”. In Buddhist epistemology the particular is the object of direct perception which cannot be expressed in words, whereas the “universal” is mentally produced and, as such, is defined as the object of inference (cf.

heart mantra, essence mantra|Sanskrit: hṛdaya <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of hṛdaya:{thugs kha/}, {snying/}, {snying ga/}, {snying kha/}, {snying po/}, {bsam pa/}, {sems/}, {thugs/}\n\nListed in the Mvy as one of the bodily parts and substances and the like (under the collective heading Mvy.1, no. 3929).\nthe heart (or region of the heart as the seat of feelings and sensations; hṛdaye kṛ ‘to take to heart’), soul, mind (as the seat of mental operations [...]), the heart or interior of the body\nIt seems beneficial to distinguish two basic usages of the word hṛdaya (“heart”) in general, namely, (a) in a primary sense of the internal vital “physical” organ and (b) in the secondary “metaphorical” sense of “the heart or centre or core or essence or best or dearest or most secret part of anything” (MW).

magical formula|Sanskrit: mantra <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of mantra:{sngags/}, {gsang sngags/}\n\n“Mantras are magical formulas consisting of syllables or words arranged in a certain fixed manner and regarded as endowed with power and efficacy. As Padoux states in his discussion of mantras in the Hindu context, the belief in the power and efficacy of the mantra has survived in India from the Vedas down to the present. The employment of mantras as a religious instrument or procedure is common to diverse Indian traditions, particularly the Tantric ones. The centrality of mantras to the Tantric traditions is expressed by the fact that the tantraśāstras are often referred to as mantraśāstras, while Buddhist Tantrism is often referred to as Mantrayāna, Mantranaya, or simply Mantra. Nevertheless, as made clear by Padoux, the utterance of a mantra is considered efficient only within the given context of a strictly controlled ritual procedure, which is in turn embedded within a culture that presupposes the mantra’s efficacy. To guarantee their efficacy, mantras must be accurately pronounced, just as the mudrās, which often accompany them, must be accurately performed. According to Padoux, mantras can be properly explained only within an Indian tradition that has a corresponding metaphysical and mythical understanding of ‘speech’ (vāc), or within the traditions which inherited such understanding from India. This is a culture, he says, where speech “has always been considered as essential, as of divine origin, as playing a fundamental role in creation.” Nevertheless, the silent (tūṣṇīm) or mental (mānasa) utterance, he says, was always rated higher than the audible one, and the fact that, from the Vedic to the Tantric period, mantras become more repetitive, increasingly levelling linguistic content and phonetic variety, shows a general tendency towards silence. Padoux cites the ancient belief that thought or consciousness is identical with the highest, silent level of speech not only as one of the reasons for the superiority of silence over actual speech in mantric practice, but also as explaining why the function of the mantra is considered inseparable from the mind of its user. As already mentioned, mantras do not always have an obvious meaning, and Padoux points out that it is their inner organization and phonetic structure that are more important. Furthermore, they are significant or meaningful only within a particular ritual activity where they are considered active. In the case where mantras seem to ‘name’ a deity, Padoux notes, they are in fact an audible expression (vācaka) of the deity; to utter the deity’s mantra is to evoke or conjure its power. In other words, when the mantra is focused on, “the attention of the user may pass on to another plane, be it a postulated inner nature or essence of the mantra or some higher, transcendent reality of which the mantra is the expression (vācaka) and which would be intuited nondiscursively by the user through an intense and concentrated mental effort (dhāraṇa or bhāvanā).”\nThere are various types of formulas, of which the most common ones are (1) mantra ((gsang) sngags; lit. ‘speech’), (2) dhāraṇī (gzungs (sngags); lit. ‘holding,’ ‘keeping (in remembrance),’ ‘retention’), often understood as a kind of mnemonic formula, (3) vidyā (rig sngags; lit. ‘knowledge’), a formula which, as is evident from its designation, is associated with the acquirement of knowledge, (4) hṛdaya (snying po; lit. ‘heart,’ ‘quintessence’), which is conceived as the ‘personal spell’ of a deity, and (5) bīja (sa bon; lit. ‘[phonic] seed’ or ‘germ’), a single syllable conceived of as comprehending the essence of a particular deity. These terms are often used interchangeably to denote more or less the same thing. \nAccording to Rong-zom-pa, the mantra, as a generic term for the various kinds of magical formulas, expresses the union of insight and stratagem, which union in turn is conceived as an expression of Buddhahood in some of the Tantric systems. The signs of these formulas, which are employed as means of attaining Buddhahood, are viewed by him as the various manifestations of the buddhas, with mantras being the manifestations of male deities, and vidyās and dhāraṇīs of female ones.”\n\nmantra, gsang sngags – defined in the Dhyānottarapaṭalaṭīkā of Buddhaguhya 4a: de la rig sngags ni bud med kyi gzugs dang dbyibs kyi lha dang / de ston pa’i sgra dang/ phyag rgya la sogs pa’o // de las bzlog pa ni gsang sngags kyi mtshan nyid do //.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:35205

unsatisfactoriness|Sanskrit: duḥkhatā <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of duḥkhatā:{sdug bsngal nyid/}, {sdug bsngal/}\n\nUsually, three kinds of duḥkhatā are distinguished in Buddhism (see the cited occurrences in primary sources).\nThe set of three kinds of duḥkhatā already appears in (arguably later strata of) the canonical sermons of Nikāya Buddhism.\nIt is generally recognized in Buddhism that there are not only painful or disagreeable (duḥkha) but also agreeable (sukha) and neutral sensations. However, the latter two can be regarded as characterized by unsatisfactoriness (duḥkhatā), too, since happiness is inherently liable to change and decay (vipariṇāma) and since neutral sensations can be associated with the most fundamental kind of unsatisfactoriness, viz., the inherent impermanence of all conditioned entities (saṃskāra). According to Schmithausen, this restriction of the application of the three kinds of unsatisfactoriness to the three kinds of sensations/feelings (vedanā) seems to mark the first step in the development of the concept.\nVasubandhu in his Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, however, restricts the character of being unsatisfactory in at least one of these three ways to only those conditioned entities that are contaminated (sāsrava), i.e. those that do not constitute  the Buddhist way to salvation. This view is typical for the later Sarvāstivādins and Yogācāras.\nThe set of three kinds of duḥkhatā is of central importance for the question of how the fundamental Buddhist belief that mundane existence (saṃsāra) is inherently characterized by “duḥkha” was justified and understood in mainstream Buddhism.\nAccording to Schmithausen, later on, the three kinds of duḥkhatā were interpreted in such a way that they do not only refer to the three kinds of sensations (vedanā), but to mundane existence (saṃsāra) as a whole.\nf.

Blue lotuses do not exist, but blue water lilies do. As Jürgen Hanneder has noted, “Sanskrit terms with the literal meaning ‘blue lotus’ (nīlāmbuja etc.) denote the blue water-lily.”\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:46173

(nt. noted only Kv 46.1–2 daśa kuśalāni karmapathāny; = Pali kammapatha; seems to be a fundamentally Buddhist term, tho recorded once by BR in Mbh. Calc. 13.583, which is followed by a list of the ten items substantially as in Buddhism, belief in the law of fruition of actions taking the place of No. 10, abstention from heresy), course of action; almost always, as in Pali, of a set of ten good (kuśala) actions consisting in avoidance of ten bad (akuśala) actions, three of body (taking life, theft, fornication or adultery), four of speech (lying, harsh speech, spiteful speech, idle or silly, disconnected speech), and three of mind (covetousness, malevolence, heresy); these are listed without use of the term karmapatha, as daśākuśalāni and or daśa kuśalāni, in Dharmas 56 and Mvy 1681–4, 1685–1698; but the same list is given in texts as the ten (a)kuśala karmapatha, so Mv i.107.13–15; Divy 301.22–25; 302.7–10; Śikṣ 69.13 ff. and Dbh 23.6 ff., in both of which each item is treated at some length, esp. in Śikṣ which describes the torments suffered in hell by those guilty of each of the 10 sins; in Mv ii.99.5–12 the ten karmapatha are slightly different; a fourth sin of the body (use of liquor) is added, and the number ten is kept by omitting one of the 4 sins of speech (harshness), also avidyā, ignorance, replaces abhidhyā, covetousness (this seems likely to be a mere corruption of tradition); in Mv i.26.12 akuśala karmapatha is used more loosely, of sinful acts in general, specifically exemplified by the five ānantarya, q.v.; in Mv i.282.14 the term ten kuśala karmapatha (in prose) is immediately followed (in verses) by a list of ten vaśitā, apparently implying that they are the same (not the usual 10 karmapatha); in Suv 6.11 the expression is daśakuśalamūlakarmapatha; often a form of the verb sam-ā-dā-, adopt, take to, adhere to, governs the noun, as in Mv ii.77.11 daśa kuśalakarmapathāṃ (acc. pl.) samāḍāya; Suv\n 6.11 … °thaṃ samādāpayet; in Mv ii.425.10 read with mss. daśakuśalakarmapathasamādānaṃ vartitvā (= vartayitvā, having practised the taking-upon-oneself, the vow, of …); cf. samādiyati, °dāpayati, °dāna; other references to the 10 kuśala, or akuśala, karmapatha, without listing, are found Mv i.3.1; 46.10; 101.18; 193.15; iii.357.14; Divy 318.22; Karmav 31.13, 14; Gv 521.4.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:232905

diamond-like meditative concentration|Sanskrit: vajropamaḥ samādhiḥ <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of vajropamaḥ samādhiḥ:{rdo rje lta bu'i ting nge 'dzin/}\n\nThis meditation occupies an elevated place in the post-canonical soteriology of the Sarvāstivādins and the early Yogācāras: By means of this samādhi, the practitioner destroys the last remaining spiritual defilements (kleśa) to be abandoned on the path of cultivation (bhāvanāmārga). The practitioner is always a “noble person” (ārya), which implies that he has already beforehand destroyed the intellectual spiritual defilements on the path of vision (darśanamārga). Accordingly, the immediate result is complete release, i.e. the state of being an arhat (arhattva).\nFor some further references, see also the entry vajropamasamādhi.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:257615

They are first mentioned and later discussed in the Samāhitā Bhūmiḥ chapter of the Basic Section of the Yogācārabhūmi.\nThe Yogācāra-s seem to understand the Sanskrit term  in such a way that it refers to meditations in which oneenters after one has already attained a clear vision of the Four Noble Truths on the darśanamārga.\nThe Yogācāra-s have inherited this set of  meditations from their recension of canonical discourses of the Buddha. Accordingly, much of its discussion in the SamBh is of an exegetical nature. In the SamBh, the full canonical wording is not cited. See, however, e.g. the quotation in the *Mahāvibhāṣā.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:258554

In addition, Tibetan scholars have assumed that the word candana has been derived from the root √cand “to gladden” and hence it has been rendered here as tshim byed (lit. “satisfier”).

True Reality|Sanskrit: dharmadhātu <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of dharmadhātu:{chos kyi dbyings/}\n\nThis is one of the equivalents of tathatā according to the Yogācārabhūmi\nThe term is also often treated as a synonym of tathatā in later Yogācāra works.\nThis meaning of the term dharmadhātu has to be distinguished from its use in the scheme of 18 dhātu-s, where it designates the objects of the manovijñāna.\nIn the Madhyāntavibhāga the term is explained as being the “cause of the [transmundane] dharma-s,” and Vasubandhu’s commentary explains that these noble (ārya) dharma-s arise from the dharmadhātu when it is taken as object (ālambana). Sthiramati’s sub-commentary specifies these dharma-s as consisting in correct insight (samyagdṛṣṭi) etc.\nHowever, the term can also be understood as “cause (or source) of the doctrinal texts (dharma),” as becomes clear from Sthiramati’s sub-commentary on the Madhyāntavibhāgabhāṣya and the Dharmadharmatā(pra)vibhāga.\nIn the old sermons of the Buddha, dharmadhātu, similarly as tathatā, rather had the meaning “nature of things” or “rule by which they must abide.”\ndharmadhātuḥ – nirukti given in Mitapadā Pañjikā of Durjayacandra (ad 2.4.15): dharmas tathatā, tāṃ dadhātīti dharmadhātuḥ kalpanājñānaśūnyaṃ vijñānam /.\nm. 1 Dharma-Element, Sphäre des Dharma; (s. dhātu, 4; BHSD s.v.: religion’; Geiger, Dhamma, S.69: ‘Wahrheit als Element, in ihrer Urgestalt’; SN(G) II 81: ‘das Wesen der Wahrheit’).\n2 das Element ‘Geistpbjekt’; (s. dhatu, 2).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:21093

the set of four limbs [of practice]|Sanskrit: caturaṅga <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of caturaṅga:{yan lag bzhi po\n/}, {yan lag bzhi pa/}\n\nA four-phased scheme based on Guhyasamājatantra xviii,136 supposed to structure the generation stage (utpattikrama, q.v.) and occasionally also the insight-gnosis initiation (prajñājñānābhiṣeka, q.v.).  The Four Limbs are worship (sevā, q.v. respectively sevāvidhāna, q.v.), near realisation (upasādhana, q.v.), realisation (sādhana, q.v.) and realisation par excellence (mahāsādhana, q.v.). In the exegetical literature relating to the Guhyasamājatantra, the application of the aṅgacatuṣṭaya varies depending on the respective tradition: in the Ārya tradition, the set of four limbs covers the entire generation process of the presiding deity and its maṇḍala, whereas in the Jñānapāda school, the set of four is applied separately  for each, the main deity, the consort and the deities of the maṇḍala. The threefold application is accounted for by a further terminological differentiation into gentle (mṛdu), middling (madhya) and exceeding (adhimātra). Exegetical literature frequently presents the correlation of the Four Limbs with associated terminological sets such as the four kāya-s or the five jñāna-s.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:105788

From an Abhidharmic point of view, a deva is a heavenly/divine being, usually endowed with splendour and power, who, on account of mundane/defiled merits, is spontaneously born in one of the six uppermost realms of the sphere of sexual desire (kāmadhātu), or in the sphere of (fine) matter / the sphere associated with corporeality (rūpadhātu), or in the sphere of immateriality / the sphere not associated with corporeality (ārūpyadhātu), and who subsequently, due to the exhaustion of the merits, falls to a lower realm of existence. Later Buddhist sources often classify such divine beings into mundane (laukika) and supramundane (lokottara) on the basis of soteriological criteria: ordinary beings (pṛthagjana) who are born in the celestial realms on account of their wholesome actions are considered laukika, and noble beings (ārya) who assume the form of a celestial being are considered lokottara.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:29802

Particularly  common are probably the analysis of the compound in either (a) tathā (“thus”) + gata (“gone,” but also “understood”) or (b) tathā (“thus”) + āgata (“come”). Moreover, quite frequently the element -gata is derived from √gad (to speak).

In two other places of the same chapter, nimitta is subdivided only into two kinds, viz. into nidānanimitta and ālambananimitta.\nAccording to the text passages from the Samāhitā Bhūmiḥ cited below under “occurrences,”  the present kind of nimitta refers to the preparative practice (prayoga) or accumulation of prerequisites for entering into a deep concentration (samādhisaṃbhāra). However, one of these text passages mentions that the various kinds of nimitta in the sense of “meditation object” (ālambananimitta) can also be regarded as a nimitta in the sense of “cause” (nidānanimitta) inasmuch as they are instrumental in letting the respective meditation object appear gradually in an ever clearer form.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:422707

Buddhist logicians classify a pseudo-reason as belonging to one of three types: unestablished (asiddha), inconclusive (anaikāntika), or opposed (viruddha), with various sub-classifications for each of these types.  The class of a pseudo-reason depends on the way in which it deviates from the three requirements: if the property used as a reason is not, in fact, present in the case that the inference is about, it is an unestablished reason; if the reason-property is present not only in cases that have the property to be proven, but also in cases which do not have that property, i.e., in the vipakṣa, then the reason-property is inconclusive; if it is present only in the vipakṣa, it is opposed.\nWhen one turns to consider what Indian logicians have to say about  fallacies of the hetu, one is struck by the lack of agreement on such topics not only between philosophers of different schools but also between Naiyāyikas themselves. In part this reflects the difficulty felt by everyone about getting any rigorous classification of fallacies, but it is even more apparent that our philosophers were victimized by a horrible confusion over terminology.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:36253

rotten inside|Sanskrit: antaḥpūti <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of antaḥpūti:{khongs myags/}, {nang myags pa/}\n\nThe term antaḥpūti occurs in Buddhist sources, such as the Madhyamāgama (Taisho 1.507b19–21), Śrāvakabhūmi (see below), and also in the Mahāvyutpatti (Sakaki, nos. 9136–9144; Ishihama, nos. 9073–9079), in a stock phrase describing a monk whose ethical-ascetical integrity/discipline is defective.\nOf the eight items occurring in a phrase describing a monk whose ethical-ascetical integrity/discipline is defective, the Mahāvyutpatti treats antaḥpūti and avasruta as a pair (rendered as khongs myags shing phyir ’dzag pa). Sakaki’s edition treats the two as a compound (i.e. antaḥpūtyavasruta), whereas Ishihama’s edition treats them as a phrase (i.e. antaḥpūtir avasrutaḥ). The Śrāvakabhūmi and Paryāyasaṃgrahaṇī treat antaḥpūti and avasruta as two separate words.\nadj. (= Pali anto-pūti), rotten inside: Mvy 9138; ed. antarpūty-avasrutaḥ, as cpd., but Mironov anta-pūti (so Kyoto ed. v.l.) and avasrutaḥ as separate words; in MSV i.50.7 (antaḥpūtir), and in Pali, where the same cliché of which this word forms a part occurs repeatedly (see CPD), this and avassuta (= BHS avasruta) are separate words. Applied to a bad monk; on the orig. literal meaning see avasruta. Also antaḥpūtī-bhāva, m., MSV i.49.3, 11; 50.6\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:64727

While the Śrāvakabhūmi offers a fairly comprehensive explanation of this word in the sense of ordinary daily obligations and occupations (of a monk), the Samāhitā Bhūmiḥ relegates some of these to another category, namely, to “what has to be done inevitably” (avaśyakaraṇīya).\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:493271

rotten|Sanskrit: kaśambakajāta <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of kaśambakajāta:{shing rul ba lta bur gyur pa/}, {shing rul ba lta bur gyur pa/}\n\nThe term kaśambakajāta occurs in Buddhist sources, such as the Madhyamāgama (Taisho 1.507b19–21), Śrāvakabhūmi (see below), and also in the Mahāvyutpatti (Sakaki, nos. 9136–9144; Ishihama, nos. 9073–9079), in a stock phrase describing a monk whose ethical-ascetical integrity/discipline is defective.\nbesudelt, unrein / defiled, dirty, impure (buddhist.) pāli kasambu- Schmutz, Unreinheit, kasambujāta- unrein, kasambukajāta- dss.\nThe etymology is uncertain.\nNote that the Chinese and Tibetan traditions seem to have read or interpreted the headword differently (although all referring to something “impure”), and consequently also translated it differently. The Tibetan translation of the Vyākhyāyukti compares the bad monk to a piece of “rotten wood” (shing rul ba), and the Tibetan translation of the Paryāyasaṃgrahaṇī of the Yogācārabhūmi compares him to “water polluted with rotten wood” (shing rul gyis brnyogs pa’i chu). Xuanzang’s translation of the Paryāyasaṃgrahaṇī compares him to a “snail born in (pure) water,” which pollutes the pure water. It should also be noted that in the Śrāvakabhūmi, the manuscript reading is kaśambodakajātaḥ rather than kaśambakajātaḥ.\nkaśambaka-jāta (also written kaṣ°, kas°; = Pali kasambu-jāta, with var. kasambuka-j°), acc. to Tib. on Mvy, rotten; this is consistent with the lit. mg. in Pali, applied to a tree the inside of which is rotten, see s.v. avasruta; the orig. mg. was forgotten in Pali at an early time, as the vague and inconsistent Pali comms. show; e.g. Vin. ii.236.26, comm. 1287.5 = ākiṇṇadosatāya saṃkiliṭṭhajātaṃ; Pugg.p. 27.10, comm. 207.25 either kasambu = kacavara, rubbish, or = tinta-kuṇapa-gataṃ kasaṭa-udakaṃ (evidently guessing): Mvy 9139 kaṣ° (but Mironov kaś°) = Tib. śiṅ rul ba (rotten) lta bur gyur pa; [Page174-b+ 71] follows antarpūty avasrutaḥ (all part of a longer cliché found repeatedly in Pali, e. g. in Vin. and Pugg.p., ll.cc.); MSV i.50.7 kaṣ°; Śikṣ 67.20 kaśambakajāto aśramaṇaḥ etc. (as in Mvy 9143-4); AsP 181.20 kas°. Could this word be related to kasavva Deśīn.\n 2.53, said to have four mgs., (1) stokam, (2) ārdram, wet, (3) pracuraṃ, (4) bāṣpaḥ?

magical spell|Sanskrit: vidyā <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of vidyā:{rig sngags/}\n\nThe word vidyā, which primarily means ‘knowledge,’ has also been used to denote a magical formula. In this sense it can be either used in the same meaning as mantra, or it can denote a particular type of magical spell. In the course of time, the magical formulas came to be identified with deities. In accordance with the grammatical gender, vidyā is associated with goddesses and mantra with male deities. The term vidyā may also refer to apotropaic texts.\nRong zom pa in his rGyud spyi’i dngos po treats vidyā (rig sngags) along with mantra (gsang sngags) and dhāraṇī (gzungs sngags) as a subtype of mantra (sngags) and goes on to explain each from the point of view of their actual nature (rang gi ngo bo), subclass (rab tu dbye ba), function (las), symbolical representation (rtags), means of access (sgo), factors opposed to them (mi mthun pa’i phyogs) and their antidotes (gnyen po), properties common to them (chos mthun pa), properties uncommon to each (tha dad chos), all possible applications (ji snyed ’jug pa), and their etymologies (nges pa’i tshig). According to Rong zom pa, vidyā is associated with the acquirement of knowledge. It “makes [one] cognize the [true] meaning of things in that it destroys and eliminates non-realization.” And “it manifests as female deities, and its essence is of the [combined] nature of insight and gnosis.” He further provides the following etymologies: “[The term] rig sngags [is the Tibetan rendering of the Sanskrit] vidyā, [which is associated with the words] (i) vidhūta, which means ‘destroying’ and ‘eliminating,’ and hence [vidyā] is explained as that which destroys and eliminates the defilements consisting in ignorance, (ii) vindati, which conveys [the meaning of] ‘attainment,’ and hence [vidyā] refers to the attainment of excellences or to the attainment of speech cognition, or (iii) vidyāsvabhāva, where ‘essence’ (ngo bo nyid: svabhāva) refers to knowledge, and in general expresses the meaning of the realized truth as well, and therefore [it] is called rig sngags.”\nvidyā, rig sngags – defined in the Dhyānottarapaṭalaṭīkā of Buddhaguhya 4a: de la rig sngags ni bud med kyi gzugs dang dbyibs kyi lha dang / de ston pa’i sgra dang/ phyag rgya la sogs pa’o // de las bzlog pa ni gsang sngags kyi mtshan nyid do //.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:567422

The word would then literally mean “those having [only] three states,” i.e. birth (janma), existence (sattā), and death (vināśa), having no old age. It is this understanding that underlies the Tibetan rendering skabs gsum pa (see one of the two explanations of the word found in the Tshig mdzod chen mo and cited below under “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Tibetan Autochthonous Works”). It should be noted, however, that both in traditional Indian sources and in modern scholarship other explanations of the word have been put forward, e.g. that it may mean the (approximately) three times ten, in other words might have originally been equivalent to trayastriṃśa (cf., e.g., the Tibetan rendering sum cu rtsa gsum pa’i lha mentioned above and the citation from the Avadānaśataka provided under “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Indic”). See for other interpretations also the citation from Amara: South Indian Commentaries provided under “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Indic.” One more interpretation of skabs gsum pa mentioned in the Tshig mdzod chen mo (see below “Occurrences in Primary Sources: Tibetan Autochthonous Works”) is “those who know three states, namely, the preceding state, present state, and following state.”\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:584489

Regarding the latter, Mayrhofer gives “highest part, top, surface” as meaning (already attested in the Ṛgveda). Moreover, he notes that the etymology is unclear, but that the word is probably derived from vi and √stabh. Apte gives the meanings “place, region, world; heaven” and “world; vessel, cup” for viṣṭap and viṣṭapa, respectively.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:584239

root-aspiration|Sanskrit: mūlapraṇidhāna <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of mūlapraṇidhāna:{rtsa ba'i smon lam/}\n\nThe two terms mūlapraṇidhāna and anupraṇidhāna were corrupted in the later transmission of the Mahāvastu in Nepal, and hence in Senart’s edition, into kuśalamūlapraṇidhāna, and anulomapraṇidhāna, thereby blurring the place of these two types of aspiration in the map of the path as conceived in Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravādin circles.\nThe concept matches closely that of ādyapraṇidhāna known to the Vaibhāṣika tradition, and at least one of the meanings of the compound pūrvapraṇidhāna. It may also be compared to that of mahāpraṇidhāna in Mahāyāna scriptures such as the Sukhāvatīvyūha.\nThe Nidānanamaskāra of the Mahāvastu establishes a distinction between the “root-aspiration” (mūlapraṇidhāna) and subsequent aspirations (anupraṇidhāna). The first one marks a bodhisattva’s entry in the praṇidhānacaryā (the second out of four phases in the bodhisattva career) while anupraṇidhāna-s are made during the third phase (anulomacaryā). The mūlapraṇidhāna is the core aspiration, which will define the future buddha-identity of the individual who makes it. His future characteristics will closely match those of the buddha in whose presence he made it. Thus, “our Buddha” Śākyamuni made his root-aspiration in the presence of a former Śākyamuni, bearing the very same characteristics.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:672543

There are indeed no occurrences to be found, it seems, in Sanskrit texts that have been published up to now. The two cited from as yet unpublished works below date from no earlier than the eleventh century.\nThe idea of phalayāna may well have been inspired by the idea expressed in Mañjuśrīnāmasaṃgīti 135cd: yānatritayaniryāta ekayānaphale sthitaḥ /.

This must be the reason why some Tibetan translators prefer to render the term as “free from houses” (khyim gyis stong pa, as if translating an original *āgāraśūnya) in certain contexts. Edgerton’s rendering “solitude” is only justifiable in such or similar exceptional contexts as well.

It is also not attested in the BHSD or in the Nachtragswörterbuch des Sanskrit. Probably it has to be regarded as a Prakritic variant of kakṣyā/kakṣā, which according to Apte can also mean “the enclosure of an edifice (either the wall &c. so enclosing it, or the court or chamber constituting the enclosure, the inner apartment of a palace)” (kakṣyā),  “wall, surrounding wall” (kakṣā). In contrast to the Tibetan translation (see above and below), the Chinese translation of the Samāhitā Bhūmiḥ does not render this word.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:776579

The two Sanskrit words are derived by adding distinct suffixes, -ya and -ika respectively. In Pali, often there is an ambiguity between these suffixes -ika and -ya, since a conjunct ending with -ya is often simplified with an epenthetic vowel i before -ya.\nadj.

The Khotanese version of the Siddhasāra has kaśmīrye at all three occurrences: 2.15,25 3.22.12 (Chii.002.12r4,14rl and 19rl). It is remarkable that the Khotanese has kaśmīrye also to render Sanskrit śrī-parṇī, said by Siddhasāra-nighaṇṭu 71 to be synonymous with kāśmarī, whereas the Tibetan does not once use taṃ-bal but always a transcription of śrī-parṇī. In the Siddhasāra śrī-parṇī occurs at 2.7,24,28\n 5.35,53. The last two places are not extant in Khotanese. śrī-parṇī seldom occurs in Vāgbhata’s Ah. At Utt. 20.12 we find a transcription: śi-ri parṇi (D 285a4), śi-dri-par-ni (P 264a5). The use of kaśmīrye in Khotanese suggests that Tibetan bal may be intended to mean «Nepalese» but one would expect bal to be the first element of the compound rather than the second.\nm.

In the Siddhasāra śrī-parṇī occurs at 2.7,24,28\n 5.35,53. The last two places are not extant in Khotanese. śrī-parṇī seldom occurs in Vāgbhata’s Ah. At Utt. 20.12 we find a transcription: śi-ri parṇi (D 285a4), śi-dri-par-ni (P 264a5). The use of kaśmīrye in Khotanese suggests that Tibetan bal may be intended to mean «Nepalese» but one would expect bal to be the first element of the compound rather than the second.\nm.

unwholesome state|Sanskrit: akuśaladharma <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of akuśaladharma:{mi dge ba'i chos/}\n\n2.1. As far as I can see, kuśala and akuśala as adjectives qualifying dharmas are only very rarely used with exclusive or primary reference to the secular level. As an exception, one can, perhaps, adduce a passage near the beginning of the Sanskrit Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra, where the kuśalā dharmāḥ which according to the Buddha will flourish and not decrease among the Vṛjis as long as certain social patterns of behavior are maintained most probably do not refer to moral or religious qualities (which would be beneficial from the karmic and spiritual perspective) but rather to a fortunate, secure, and unassailable economic and political situation. These aspects of secular welfare are, however, by no means detrimental to moral and spiritual growth, and it is hard to imagine that in any Buddhist text an action or attitude that yields profit in this life but entails evil consequences in the afterlife or is spiritually detrimental would be qualified as kuśala.\n 2.2. Not infrequently, however, the texts point out that dharmas that are (or may be) qualified as kuśala and akuśala in the karmic or spiritual perspective tend to have, respectively, agreeable and disagreeable consequences already in the present life as well. Successfully cultivated spiritual practices, e.g., and especially the various levels of deep meditation, are described as involving a state of non-sensual happiness and equanimity, and keeping the moral precepts not only leads to rebirth in heaven after death but is often described as also entailing happiness in this very life because one is free from contrition and feels at ease among people or in meetings, receives social approval, enjoys economic success due to non-negligence, runs no risk of being punished, and dies a peaceful death. As against this, breaking the moral precepts tends to have the opposite effects. As the Yogācārabhūmi puts it, a person deciding and attempting to kill someone else may succeed in doing so or may fail. In the first case, he will in any case experience painful retribution in the afterlife,  but he may also incur punishment or reproach in the present life. Even if he is unsuccessful, he may incur punishment or reproach in this life or at least suffer from frustration because his attempt failed.\nIt should be noted that instead of the compound akuśaladharma (as well as the opposite kuśaladharma), in primary sources we often find the two basic words uncompounded and in the plural. See, for instance, references in SWTF to texts found in Turfan where the word akuśala occurs in connection with the word dharma, usually not in compound and in the plural.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:897405

The words adhiśīlam etc. were orig. adverbs (adhi governing the second member, in a manner referring to…) and are still so used, e.g. Bbh 373.20--21 adhiśīlaṃ (and adhicittaṃ, adhiprajñaṃ) śikṣā; loc. forms are also used in the same way, as adhicitte ca āyogaḥ Ud xxxii.27(32) = Pali Dnp. 185 (same text). These forms may be turned into adjectives: adhiśīlo vihāro Bbh 335.1; sa vihāraḥ adhicitta ity ucyate Bbh 338.21 (this usage seems not recorded in Pali). Often the stems adhiśīla-, adhicitta-, adhiprajña- are used as prior members of cpds., in which case precise analysis becomes difficult; so Bbh 185.14; 333.2; 335.3; 338.24; 341.8; etc. But sometimes adhiprajñā-śikṣā is used as a cpd., Dharmas 140, the prior member being then evidently taken as stem of a noun. As nouns, adhiśīla, adhicitta, and adhiprajñā, like their Pali equivalents, are used Mvy 930--2; Bbh 317.2 (parallel with adhimuktiḥ), being then reinterpreted (with adhi = adhika) as superior morality, intellect, wisdom, see CPD s.vv. adhisīla, °citta, °paññā[.]\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:920441

Mantramārga is also used as a synonym, though it is noticeably of rarer occurrence than mantranaya and mantranīti. The order of frequency of use of these terms in Buddhist literature seems to be mantranaya, mantrayāna, mantranīti, mantramārga. Note that in Śaiva literature mantramārga is the most common designation of the Tantric form of Śaivism, while mantranaya, mantranīti, and mantrayāna are virtually unattested. Of these four terms, only mantramārga is current (though much less common than in Śaiva texts) in Vaiṣṇava Pāñcarātra tantric literature.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:946890

It may be possible that this confusion is related to a possible ambiguity of adhaḥ as ‘lower’ in the sense of worn beneath another garment (i.e. ‘inner’) or as ‘lower’ in the sense of covering the lower part of the body; note that the meaning given in the Amarakośa  for antarīya (and upasaṃvyāna and paridhāna, treated as synonyms thereof) is adhoṃśuka.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:947728

“being in … the quick path”|Sanskrit: śīghrayāna <Word/Term/Phrase>\n\n\nTibetan renderings of śīghrayāna:{theg pa myur ba dang ldan pa/}, {myur ba'i theg pa/}\n\nn. (also pl.) rapid motion, MBh. …  mfn. moving rapidly, Kām.\n1. śīghrayāna n. rascher Gang, rasches Fahren Mbh. 3, 2638. 2749 (pl.). …\n 2. śīghrayāna adj. = śīghraga Kām. Nītis. 19, 16.\nThe occurrences of this term, in non-Buddhist and Buddhist texts, can be classified thus. The second member of the compound is fundamentally a neuter noun formed from the root yā with the suffix lyuṭ which could denote “vehicle,” “path,” or  “(the action of) going.” The entire compound can then either be a karmadhāraya (giving the possible meanings “swift going,”  “swift vehicle,” or “swift path,” though here “swift” would have to be understood  in a secondary sense such as “which can be swiftly traversed”), or a bahuvrīhi adjective (giving the possible meanings “whose going/movement is swift,” “whose vehicle is swift,” or “whose path is swift,” in which case again “swift” would have to be understood in a secondary sense). Of these  theoretical, and perfectly natural, possibilities, the meanings “swift vehicle” and “swift path” seem so far not to be attested in Sanskrit texts.\n\nSee the full entry at:https://www.itlr.net/hwid:956112
