Indo-Tibetan Lexical Resource (2023)
https://www.itlr.net/

The Indo-Tibetan Lexical Resource (ITLR) is a collaborative lexical project built around Sanskrit Headwords which are ordered under the rubrics (1) Word/Term/Phrase, (2) Place Name, (3) Personal name, or (4) Title of Scripture/Treatise. It aims to provide occurrences of these lexical items in Indic sources, attested Tibetan translations of them, modern renderings, and references to them in discussions in academic works. The ITLR involves a number of scholars from around the world in various capacities, 
including editors, advisors, contributors, and visiting fellows, and it cooperates with several institutions.

Many thanks go to Dr. Orna Almogi for allowing the ITLR resources to be included in this application, to Prof. Kiyonori Nagasaki for implementing a data export and making the ITLR data available, and to all contributors of the ITLR project.
