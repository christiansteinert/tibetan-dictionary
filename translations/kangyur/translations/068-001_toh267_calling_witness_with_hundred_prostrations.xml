                    arrive in Tibet, long before Tibet became a Buddhist nation, during the reign of the Tibetan King Lha Thothori
                    Nyentsen. Written to be recited for personal practice, it opens with a hundred and eight prostrations and
                    praises to the many buddhas of the ten directions and three times, to the twelve categories of scripture
                    contained in the Tripiṭaka, to the bodhisattvas of the ten directions, and to the arhat disciples of the
                    Buddha. After making offerings to them, confessing and purifying nonvirtue, and making the aspiration to
                    perform virtuous actions in every life, the text includes recitations of the vows of refuge in the Three
                    Jewels, and of generating the thought of enlightenment. The text concludes with a passage rejoicing in the
                    virtues of the holy ones, a request for the buddhas to bestow a prophecy to achieve enlightenment, and the
                    aspiration to pass from this life in a state of pure Dharma.</p>

                        became Buddhist or had a written language. This history is substantiated by the text’s own colophon, as

                            had been ruled by the Bön. In a dream (which this king had) it was prophesied to him that on the 5th

                        translated in the mid-seventh century, almost immediately after Tibet’s written language was developed.
                        Thus, <title xml:lang="en">Calling Witness with a Hundred Prostrations</title> may be not only the first
                        Buddhist scripture to arrive in Tibet, it was also among the first to be translated and written in the new

                        the Potala palace and Jokhang temples were being built in Lhasa. Butön implies that this text may have
                        been read or studied by the first great Tibetan Dharma King Songtsen Gampo (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">srong btsan sgam po</foreign>). As Butön explains:</p>

                            was given a resemblance with the Kashmirian characters. After (this alphabet) had been definitely

                        virtuous actions in every life, the text includes recitations of the vows of refuge in the Three Jewels,
                        and of generating the thought of enlightenment. The text concludes with a passage rejoicing in the virtues
                        of the holy ones, a request for the buddhas to bestow a prophecy to achieve enlightenment, and the
                        aspiration to pass from this life in a state of pure Dharma.</p>

                    <p tid="16">One of the difficult aspects of translating this text was the title itself, in Tibetan <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpang skong phyag brgya pa</foreign>. The translation adopted here, <title xml:lang="en">Calling Witness with a Hundred Prostrations</title>, differs considerably from
                        Obermiller’s early loose translation of the title as <title xml:lang="en">One Hundred Precepts Concerning
                            Worship</title>, cited above. The phrase <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpang skong</foreign> means
                        calling witness. It is the same word used to call a witness in a trial. In this context, it probably
                        refers to inviting the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions to be a witness to one’s practice of
                        Dharma, particularly to the confession and purification of nonvirtue which is contained in this sūtra, as
                        ideally such confession and purification is done in the presence of holy beings. Following the confession,
                        the buddhas and bodhisattvas also serve as witnesses to the vows of refuge and the thought of
                        enlightenment, and to the subsequent rejoicing and aspiration to virtuous deeds. As for the phrase
                            <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">phyag brgya</foreign>, it means <distinct>one hundred
                            prostrations</distinct> or <distinct>one hundred homages</distinct>.</p>
