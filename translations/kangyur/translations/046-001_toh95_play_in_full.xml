                    attained awakening, as perceived from the perspective of the Great Vehicle. The sūtra, which is structured in
                    twenty-seven chapters, first presents the events surrounding the Buddha’s birth, childhood, and adolescence in
                    the royal palace of his father, king of the Śākya nation. It then recounts his escape from the palace and the
                    years of hardship he faced in his quest for spiritual awakening. Finally the sūtra reveals his complete
                    victory over the demon Māra, his attainment of awakening under the Bodhi tree, his first turning of the wheel
                    of Dharma, and the formation of the very early saṅgha.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title> (<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Lalitavistara</title>) is without
                        a doubt one of the most important sūtras within Buddhist Mahāyāna literature. With parts of the text
                        dating from the earliest days of the Buddhist tradition, this story of the Buddha’s awakening has
                        captivated the minds of devotees, both ordained and lay, as far back as the beginning of the common
                        era.</p>

                    <p tid="8">In brief, <title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title> tells the story of how the Buddha
                        manifested in this world and attained awakening. The sūtra, which is structured in twenty-seven chapters,
                        begins with the Buddha being requested to teach the sūtra by several gods, as well as the thousands of
                        bodhisattvas and hearers in his retinue. The gods summarize the sūtra in this manner (chap. 1):</p>
                    <q>
                        <p tid="9"> “Blessed One, there is an extensive collection of discourses on the Dharma that bears the name
                                <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Lalitavistara</title> (<title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title>).
                            This teaching illuminates the basic virtues of the bodhisattvas, showing how the Bodhisattva descended
                            from the sublime palace in the Heaven of Joy, intentionally entered the womb, and sojourned in the
                            womb. It shows the power of the place where he was born to a noble family, and how he surpassed others
                            through all the superior special qualities that he demonstrated through his actions as a youth. It
                            shows his many unique qualities, such as his skills in arts, crafts, writing, arithmetic,
                            calculations, astrology, fencing, archery, feats of physical strength, and wrestling, demonstrating
                            his superiority to all others in these areas. It shows how he enjoyed his retinue of consorts and the
                            pleasures of his kingdom. </p>
                        <p tid="10"> “This teaching proclaims how he attained the result brought about by the concordant cause of
                            all the bodhisattva activities, showing how he manifested as a bodhisattva and destroyed the legions
                            of Māra. It explains the ten powers, the fourfold fearlessness, and the other innumerable qualities of
                            a thus-gone one, and presents the infinite teachings taught by the thus-gone ones of times past.” </p>
                    </q>
                    <p tid="11">The Buddha silently accepts this request, and the following day he commences the teaching.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-5"/>
                    <p tid="12">The story begins in the divine realms where the future Buddha (who, prior to his awakening, is
                        known as the Bodhisattva) enjoys a perfect life surrounded by divine pleasures. Due to his past
                        aspirations, however, the musical instruments of the palace call out to him, reminding him of his prior
                        commitment to attain awakening (chap. 2). Inspired by this reminder, the Bodhisattva announces, to the
                        despair of the gods, that he will abandon his divine pleasures in pursuit of full and complete awakening
                        on this earth (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Jambudvīpa</foreign>), where he will take birth within a
                        suitably noble family (chap. 3). However, before his departure from the heavenly realms, the Bodhisattva
                        delivers one final teaching to the gods (chap. 4) and, having installed the bodhisattva Maitreya as his
                        regent, he sets out for the human realm accompanied by great displays of divine offerings and auspicious
                        signs (chap. 5). He enters the human world via the <term type="ignore">womb</term> of Queen Māyā, where he
                        resides for the duration of the pregnancy within an exquisite temple, enjoying the happiness of absorption
                        (chap. 6).</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-6"/>
                    <p tid="13">After taking birth in the Lumbinī Grove and declaring his intention to attain complete awakening
                        (chap. 7), we follow the infant Bodhisattva on a temple visit where the stone statues rise up to greet him
                        (chap. 8) and hear of the marvelous jewelry that his father, the king, commissions for him (chap. 9).
                        Next, as the Bodhisattva matures, the sūtra recounts his first day at school, where he far surpasses even
                        the most senior tutors (chap. 10); his natural attainment of the highest levels of meditative
                        concentration during a visit to the countryside (chap. 11); and his incredible prowess in the traditional
                        worldly arts, which he uses to win the hand of Gopā, a Śākya girl whose father requires proof of the
                        Bodhisattva’s <term type="ignore">qualities</term> as a proper husband (chap. 12).</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-7"/>
                    <p tid="14">The Bodhisattva has now reached maturity and can enjoy life in the palace, where he is surrounded
                        by all types of pleasure, including a large harem to entertain him. Seeing this, the gods begin to worry
                        that he will never leave such a luxurious life, and they therefore gently remind him of his vows to awaken
                        (chap. 13). This reminder, however, turns out to be unnecessary, as the Bodhisattva is far from attached
                        to such fleeting pleasures. Instead, to the great despair of everyone in the Śākya kingdom, he renounces
                        his royal pleasures. Inspired by the sight of a sick person, an old man, a corpse, and a religious
                        mendicant (chap. 14), he departs from the palace to begin the life of a religious seeker on a spiritual
                        journey, which eventually leads him to awakening (chap. 15).</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-8"/>
                    <p tid="15">Already at this early stage of his religious career, the Bodhisattva is no ordinary being. It
                        quickly becomes apparent that he surpasses all the foremost spiritual teachers of his day. His
                        extraordinary charisma also attracts many beings, such as the king of Magadha, who requests the
                        Bodhisattva to take up residence in his kingdom, but without success (chap. 16). In a final test of the
                        established contemplative systems of his day, the Bodhisattva next follows Rudraka, a renowned spiritual
                        teacher. But once again he is disappointed, although he quickly masters the prescribed trainings.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-9"/>
                    <p tid="16">These experiences lead the Bodhisattva to the conclusion that he must discover awakening on his
                        own, so he sets out on a six-year journey of austere practices, which are so extreme in nature that they
                        take him to the brink of death (chap. 17). Finally the Bodhisattva realizes that such practices do not
                        lead to awakening and, encouraged by some protective gods, he begins to eat a normal diet once again,
                        which restores his former physique and health (chap. 18). At this point he senses that he is on the verge
                        of attaining his goal, and therefore sets out for the seat of awakening (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">bodhimaṇḍa</foreign>), the sacred place where all bodhisattvas in their last
                        existence attain full and complete awakening (chap. 19). As he arrives at the seat of awakening, the gods
                        create a variety of impressive miraculous displays, and the place eventually comes to resemble a divine
                        realm, fit for the epic achievement that awaits the Bodhisattva (chap. 20).</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-10"/>
                    <p tid="17">Still, just as everything has been prepared to celebrate the attainment of awakening, Māra, the
                        most powerful demon in the desire realm, arrives with the aim of preventing the Bodhisattva from attaining
                        his goal. Together with his terrifying army and seductive daughters, Māra tries every trick in the book to
                        discourage the Bodhisattva, but to no avail. Sad and dejected, Māra eventually gives up his disgraceful
                        attempt at creating obstacles (chap. 21). Now the stage is finally set for the Bodhisattva to attain
                        awakening under the Bodhi tree, a gradual process that unfolds throughout the night until he fully and
                        perfectly awakens at dawn to become the Awakened One (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Buddha</foreign>), or Thus-Gone One (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Tathāgata</foreign>), as
                        he is known subsequent to his awakening (chap. 22). As is only suitable for such an epic achievement, the
                        entire pantheon of divine beings now hurry to the Thus-Gone One, making offerings and singing his praise

                    <p tid="18">During the first seven weeks following his awakening, the Buddha keeps to himself and does not
                        teach. In fact he worries that the truth he has discovered might be too profound for others to comprehend,
                        except perhaps a bodhisattva in his last existence. Māra, who senses the Buddha’s dilemma, turns up and
                        tries one last trick, suggesting to the Buddha that perhaps this would be a suitable time to pass straight
                        into parinirvāṇa. The Buddha, however, makes it clear that he has no such plans, and finally Māra relents.
                        During these first seven weeks, we also hear of other encounters between the Buddha and some local
                        passersby, but significantly no teaching is given (chap. 24). Setting up an important example for the
                        tradition, the Buddha eventually consents to teach the Dharma only after it has been requested four times,
                        in this case by all the gods, headed by Brahmā and Śakra. As he says, “O Brahmā, the gates of nectar are
                        opened” (chap. 25).</p>

                    <p tid="19">At this point, the Buddha determines through his higher knowledge that the first people to hear
                        his teaching should be his five former companions from the days when he was practicing austerities.
                        Although these ascetics originally rejected the Bodhisattva when he decided to abandon their path, when
                        they meet the Buddha again at the Deer Park outside of Vārāṇasī, they are rendered helpless by his
                        majestic presence and request teachings from him. The five companions instantly receive ordination and, in
                        a seminal moment, the Buddha teaches them the four truths of the noble ones: suffering, the origin of
                        suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path that leads to the cessation of suffering. Thus this
                        occasion constitutes the birth of the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha (chap. 26).
                        This marks the end of the teaching proper. Finally, in the epilogue, the Buddha encourages his retinue of
                        gods and humans to take this sūtra as their practice and propagate it to the best of their abilities
                        (chap. 27).</p>

                    <p tid="20">This version of the story thus ends at the very moment when the Buddha has finally manifested all
                        the qualities of awakening and is fully equipped to influence the world, as he did over the next
                        forty-five years by continuously teaching the Dharma and establishing his community of followers. From our
                        perspective, this may seem odd. Why do we not get to follow the Buddha as he builds his community of <term type="ignore">monks</term> and nuns and interacts with the people of India, high and low, throughout
                        his teaching career? And why do we not get to hear the details of his old age and passing into nirvāṇa?
                        After all, this is the part of his life where his inconceivable qualities are most evident and where his
                        glory as the fully awakened Buddha is most radiant.</p>

                    <p tid="21">The answer of course cannot be settled here, but we can at least surmise. Perhaps the aim of this
                        account is not to describe the life of the Buddha in the way one would expect in a traditional biography,
                        or even a religious hagiography. Instead, the scope of <title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title> may
                        be to tell the story of the complete awakening of a bodhisattva in his last existence. The many events
                        that occurred post awakening during the Buddha’s forty-five-year teaching career are therefore not of
                        particular interest to a project that aims to describe the awakening of a buddha. These events, moreover,
                        are well documented in the teachings preserved elsewhere in the Buddhist canon.</p>

                        exclusively as the “life of the Buddha” in the way we might ordinarily understand such a phrase, but
                        rather as an account of the unfolding of awakening itself, clearly centered around the figure of Buddha
                        Śākyamuni, yet with many themes and plots that do not exclusively refer to his particular life example.
                        Although we do hear of events specific to the life of Buddha Śākyamuni in the chapters concerning his
                        education, athletic prowess, and so on, we are often reminded that the main occurrences recounted in
                            <title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title> have unfolded previously, namely whenever past
                        bodhisattvas awoke to the level of a thus-gone one. Thus this story represents nothing new under the sun;
                        instead it recounts what happens to everyone who is in a position such as the Bodhisattva’s.</p>

                        is the ahistorical Mahāyāna backdrop that informs the entire story line. Throughout the text, the story is
                        covered by a latticework of mind-boggling miracles and feats that defy comprehension by the ordinary
                        intellect. Clearly, in the perspective of the Mahāyāna, the world is fashioned according to the lenses
                        that we use to see with. And here, in <title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title>, the lenses are those
                        of full and complete awakening. This fact is already alluded to in the title of the text, which describes
                        the events in the Bodhisattva’s life as a play. As such the events in the Bodhisattva’s life are not
                        ordinary karmic activity that unfold based on the mechanisms of a conceptual mind, but rather the playful
                        manner in which the nonconceptual wisdom of a tenth-level bodhisattva unfolds as an expression of his
                        awakened insight. In this manner of storytelling, the reader is invited into the worldview of a timeless
                        and limitless universe as perceived by the adepts of the Mahāyāna. The time span, numbers, and sizes
                        within this Mahāyāna scripture are so persistently overwhelming that all historical and scientific
                        thinking as we know it eventually loses meaning and relevance.</p>

                        teachings of the Mahāyāna. Thus, to fully appreciate this text, the reader must also attend to its

                        impact readers, rather than simply approaching the text as documentary evidence of a life well lived. The

                        the scholar it may appear as an exemplary specimen of Buddhist philosophy and literature. For others it

                        before this text appeared in writing, as early scholarship on the sūtra has already pointed out (e.g.,
                        Winternitz 1927). This essential framework, however, was greatly developed and adorned by the sūtra’s
                        compilers/authors in order to create its current form, which Vaidya (1958) has dated to the third century
                        <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. Before that time, stories surrounding the life of the Buddha (and the Bodhisattva in his last and
                        previous existences) were in place in the various canons of the early Buddhist schools. However, the

                    <p tid="26">This scripture is an obvious compilation of various early sources, which have been strung together
                        and elaborated on according to the Mahāyāna worldview. As such this text is a fascinating example of the
                        ways in which the Mahāyāna rests firmly on the earlier tradition, yet reinterprets the very foundations of
                        Buddhism in a way that fits its own vast perspective. The fact that the text is a compilation is initially
                        evident from the mixture of prose and verse that, in some cases, contains strata from the very earliest
                        Buddhist teachings and, in other cases, presents later Buddhist themes that do not emerge—in written form
                        at least—until the first centuries of the common era. Previous scholarship on <title xml:lang="en">The
                            Play in Full</title> (mostly published in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries) devoted
                        much time to determining the text’s potential sources and their respective time periods, although without
                        much success. For example, while the first critical publications argued that the verse sections of the
                        text represent a more ancient origin than the parts written in prose, that theory had largely been
                        dismissed by the beginning of the twentieth century (Winternitz 1927). Although this topic clearly
                        deserves further study, it is interesting to note that hardly any new research on this sūtra has been
                        published during the last sixty years. As such the only thing we can currently say concerning the sources
                        and origin of <title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title> is that it was based on several early and, for
                        the most part, unidentified sources that belong to the very early days of the Buddhist tradition.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title> makes no attempt to present itself as a homogenous text
                        composed by a single author. In fact it seems that the compilers of the text took <term type="ignore">pride</term> in presenting an account of the Bodhisattva’s last existence that was as detailed and
                        all-encompassing as possible and thus, to this end, it was perfectly acceptable to draw openly on a
                        variety of sources. One obvious example of this is the fact that although the story is for the most part
                        recounted in the third person, it occasionally and abruptly shifts into a first-person narrative where the
                        Buddha recounts the events himself. In addition, there is often a significant overlap between the topics
                        covered in the prose and verse sections, and in these places the compilers of the text have made no
                        attempt to polish away the inconsistencies and redundancies. It is likely that the discerning readers of

                        instances of “the words of the Buddha” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">buddhavacana</foreign>).
                        Certainly the Mahāyāna literature contains many statements in support of such an open-ended approach to

                        the translation on numerous occasions where the Sanskrit clarified obscure passages in the Tibetan version
                        or represented a preferred reading.</p>

                    <p tid="34">As such it is fair to say that this translation as it stands is an equal product of the Tibetan
                        and the Sanskrit. Although some scholars may have preferred a translation from the Sanskrit alone, we
                        believe that the present approach is justified, since a comparative study of the available manuscripts
                        makes it clear that several strands of manuscripts were extant in India, sometimes with significant
                        differences in wording and content. Moreover, as the Tibetan translation predates the existing Sanskrit
                        manuscripts by centuries, the Tibetan may indeed represent an earlier stratum that <term type="ignore">merits</term> attention apart from merely complementing the Sanskrit.</p>

                    <p tid="35">In producing this translation, we have sought to incorporate the best of both manuscript
                        traditions through a diplomatic approach that does not give preference to either language<foreign xml:lang="la"> a priori</foreign>. Since there are literally thousands of differences between the
                        Sanskrit and the Tibetan manuscripts when all levels of variance are considered, we have avoided
                        annotating each individual reading preference in the translation. Our motivation for this has been to
                        present a translation that the general reader can enjoy without getting distracted by numerous
                        philological discussions and annotations that would interest but a few scholarly specialists. Instead, for
                        those who would like to study the translation together with the original manuscripts, we have included
                        references to the page numbers of both the Sanskrit and the Tibetan manuscripts, providing the specialist
                        with an easy means for comparative textual studies. In this way it is our hope that both the general
                        reader and the specialist may find the present translation to be of benefit and inspiration.</p>

                        extremely powerful. He had mastered the perfections of generosity, discipline, patience, diligence, mental
                        stability, knowledge, and skillful means, and was adept in the fourfold path of Brahmā: great love, great
                        compassion, great joy, and great equanimity. With great awareness, he was free of obscurations and had
                        manifested the vision of wisdom free from attachment. Likewise he had perfected each and every quality of
                        awakening: the applications of mindfulness, the thorough relinquishments, the bases of miraculous power,

                        with māndārava and mahāmāndārava flowers. The songs of millions upon millions of celestial maidens could
                        be heard throughout. [11] Its enchanting, even grounds were covered with golden canopies and filled with
                        various trees, such as mountain ebonies, campakas, trumpet vines, orchids, muchalindas, mahāmuchalindas,
                        aśokas, banyans, persimmon trees, narras, karṇikāras, kesaras, sāls, and coral trees. In every direction
                        there were flowered canopies, overflowing with jyotiṣ, mālikas, barasikas, taraṇīs, sumanas, bali,
                        kotaranis, and other sweet-smelling flowers. Likewise there were danukari flowers, celestial flowers, blue
                        lotuses, pink lotuses, water lilies, and white lotuses. Various birds flew through the air, singing out
                        their beautiful melodies. Among them were parrots, śārikas, cuckoos, geese, peacocks, ducks, pheasants,
                        snipe, partridge, and many others.</p>

                        hundred leagues high. Surrounded by all these many trillions of gods, he then descended back down to
                        Jambudvīpa. [62]</p>

                        Bodhisattva. These gods further embellished the jeweled structure that had delighted the Bodhisattva,
                        using divine fabrics, garlands, perfumes, flowers, music, and other divine delights. The most eminent
                        among the gods all surrounded the structure.</p>

                        completely transfixed, but he was unable to see the jeweled structure. Why was that? Among the gods, those
                        of the Brahma realm have the greatest ability, and the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, the Heaven
                        Free from Strife, the Heaven of Joy, the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, and the Heaven of Making Use
                        of Others’ Emanations are inferior in comparison to them. So what need is there to speak of Śakra, master
                        of the gods?</p>

                        all go insane merely from hearing such music. <ref cRef="F.35.b"/>
                    </p>
                    <p tid="397">The four great kings now came before Śakra, lord of the gods, and asked him, “Lord of the gods,
                        what can we do? We are unable to see this jeweled structure that delighted the Bodhisattva.”</p>
                    <p tid="398">“Friends, what can I do?” Śakra responded. “I also cannot see it right now. Nevertheless, friends,
                        when it is brought into the presence of the Blessed One, we should be able to see it.”</p>
                    <p tid="399">The four great kings pleaded, “Lord of the gods, for that reason let us quickly do whatever is
                        necessary to see it!”</p>
                    <p tid="400">“Friends,” replied Śakra, “wait until the best of the superior gods come into the presence of the
                        Blessed One and delight him.”</p>
                    <p tid="401">Thus they stood aside, turned their heads, and gazed intently at the Blessed One. [63] Suddenly
                        Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, arrived together with 84 trillion gods, carrying the jeweled structure
                        that had delighted the Bodhisattva and bringing it in front of the Thus-Gone One.</p>

                        beautiful to behold. It was square in form and had four pillars. At the top was a beautifully adorned
                        upper floor scaled to fit a six-month-old fetus. Inside that upper chamber was a throne with a sitting

                        their eyes were dazzled and they were amazed. When it was placed in the presence of the Thus-Gone One, it
                        gleamed, radiated heat, and shone brightly. This multistoried structure was as resplendent as gold that

                        Bodhisattva, which resembles a conch in shape and color. Even the garments worn by the great Brahmā lost
                        their beauty in front of the Bodhisattva’s throne, causing them to resemble cast-off black blankets that
                        have been beaten by wind and rain. The temple was made from uraga sandalwood, which is so precious that a
                        single mote of its dust is equal in value to a thousand universes. Furthermore the temple was surrounded
                        on all sides by more such uraga sandalwood.</p>

                        the second structure. Within that third temple made of incense was a throne with cushions. The color of
                        the uraga sandalwood was like the finest blue beryl. Around the temple of incense were all types of
                        flowers that surpassed even those of the gods. They had not been planted there, but appeared solely

                        piercing the earth and rising up six million eight hundred thousand leagues, as far as the Brahma realm.

                        great Brahmā placed this drop into a beautiful vessel of beryl and offered it to the Bodhisattva. The
                        Bodhisattva accepted the gift and, out of affection for the great Brahmā, he drank it. Apart from a
                        bodhisattva in his final existence, who has completed all the bodhisattva stages, no other being is able

                        energy? [65] When the Bodhisattva was practicing the conduct of a bodhisattva for extended periods in the
                        past, he gave medicine to the sick, fulfilled the wishes of those who had aspirations, and never abandoned
                        those who came to him for refuge. He always offered the finest flowers, the best fruits, and the most
                        delicious foods first to the thus-gone ones, the memorials of the thus-gone ones, the saṅgha of hearers of
                        the thus-gone ones, and his parents. Only then would he cater to his own needs. It was as a result of this
                        activity that the great Brahmā offered the Bodhisattva this drop of nectar.</p>

                        constructed both inside and outside. It was also pleasant to touch, like silk from Kaliṅga. This is merely

                        the nature of things that a great bodhisattva is born into the human world. Having renounced his home, he
                        attains perfect and complete awakening and turns the wheel of Dharma. Yet before he enters his mother’s

                        tiered chamber. The body of a bodhisattva in his last existence is free from the four stages [66] of
                        embryonic development. Instead he appears seated, with all his limbs, organs, and characteristics fully

                    <p tid="421">Monks, noontime passed, and it was now evening when Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, surrounded by
                        many hundreds of thousands of gods, approached the Bodhisattva carrying a drop of the vital force of the
                        divine realms. They came to meet the Bodhisattva and to offer him their respect and veneration, and also
                        to listen to the Dharma.</p>

                        retinue, and again he raised his golden-colored right hand. He cordially greeted Brahmā, lord of the Sahā
                        World, and those gods of the pure realms, and pointed out their seats to them. Monks, again it was not
                        possible [70] for Brahmā, lord of the Sahā World, to resist the Bodhisattva’s command. Thus Brahmā, lord
                        of the Sahā World, as well as the other gods of the pure realms, settled on those seats that had been
                        arranged. When the Bodhisattva knew that they were settled, he taught them a Dharma teaching and instructed
                        them, <ref cRef="F.39.b"/> inspired them, and delighted them. In whichever
                        direction the Bodhisattva would extend his hand, the mother of the Bodhisattva would turn to face that
                        way. Then the gods reflected, “The Bodhisattva is having a heartwarming conversation with us.” And each
                        one of them thought, “The Bodhisattva is speaking directly to me; to me alone he extends a friendly
                        welcome.”</p>

                        the Bodhisattva, who knew full well their thoughts, extended his right hand as a farewell greeting. As he
                        retracted his hand with mindfulness and carefulness, there was no harm done to his mother. Then Brahmā,
                        lord of the Sahā World, and those gods of the pure realms reflected, “We have been dismissed by the
                        Bodhisattva.” Then they circled around the Bodhisattva and his mother three times before departing.
                        Finally the Bodhisattva let his hand rest while maintaining mindfulness and carefulness.</p>

                        the Bodhisattva’s body began emitting light, which manifested into lion thrones. The Bodhisattva then
                        indicated to the bodhisattvas to take their seat on these thrones. When he knew that they were settled,
                        the Bodhisattva questioned and examined the bodhisattvas [71] regarding the divisions pertaining to the
                        Great Vehicle. However, with the exception of the gods who were of equal fortune, no one else perceived

                        uncomfortable pains in her belly. She was not afflicted by attachment, anger, or delusion. She did not

                        witnessed any heat, cold, hunger, thirst, gloom, uncleanliness, or fatigue. No unpleasant forms, sounds,
                        smells, tastes, or textures appeared to her, and she also had no bad dreams. There was no female

                    <p tid="426">At that time the mother of the Bodhisattva observed the five basic precepts. She was disciplined
                        and followed the path of the ten virtuous actions. The mother of the Bodhisattva never desired any man
                        whomsoever, and neither did any man feel lust in the presence of the mother of the Bodhisattva.</p>

                        the Bodhisattva placed her right hand on the top of their head. In this way she would cure those who
                        suffered from any illness or ailment that arises from disharmony among wind, bile, or phlegm. <ref cRef="F.40.b"/> She would cure illnesses related to the eyes, [72] ears, nose, tongue, and lips, as

                        disease, these people could then return to their homes. Queen Māyā would also pick herbs and distribute
                        them to the sick, who would immediately regain their health and vigor.</p>

                        flowers fell. The gods sent timely rains, and the winds blew at appropriate moments. The seasons and the

                        budded and blossomed. New fruit and flower trees sprung from the earth, budded, and came into blossom.
                        Eight trees of precious gems appeared. Twenty thousand great treasures emerged and remained on the
                        grounds. <ref cRef="F.42.b"/> Inside the women’s quarters, jeweled shoots sprouted forth. Scented water,
                        saturated with fragrant oils, flowed forth. Lion cubs descended from the snow mountains. They joyfully
                        circled the sublime city of Kapilavastu and then rested by the gates without harming anyone. Five hundred
                        young white elephants arrived, stroking King Śuddhodana’s feet with the tips of their trunks, and then
                        settling down next to him. Divine children, wearing sashes, [77] were seen moving back and forth between
                        the laps of the women in the retinue of King Śuddhodana’s queen.</p>

                        holding up peacock feathers. Ten thousand full vases appeared in a ring around the city of Kapilavastu.
                        Ten thousand celestial maidens appeared with vases of scented water on their heads. Ten thousand celestial
                        maidens appeared holding up parasols, flags, and banners. Many hundreds of thousands of celestial maidens
                        appeared holding conch shells, drums, clay drums, and cymbals adorned with bells.</p>

                        appeared. King Śuddhodana’s residence became adorned with a net of jewels. [103] All fires were

                        The doors to the storehouses of cloths and gems appeared wide open. <ref cRef="F.43.a"/> The calls of
                        crows, owls, vultures, wolves, and jackals ceased to be heard. Instead many delightful sounds were heard.
                        All people stopped their work. The ground became level without any bumps or hollows. All crossroads,
                        junctions, roads, and marketplaces became as even and smooth as the palm of a hand and were beautifully
                        bestrewn with flower petals. All pregnant women birthed their babies with comfort and ease. All the gods
                        in the sāl forest revealed half their bodies from among the trees’ leaves and remained there, bowing. Such
                        were the thirty-two omens that occurred. [78]</p>

                        Richly scented cloths of many colors were draped across its branches. It was sparkling with the light of
                        many gems and jewels. Its roots, trunk, branches, and leaves were all adorned with jewels. Its branches
                        were long and spread out spaciously. The ground where the fig tree stood was smooth like the palm of a

                        pleasant to the touch, like soft kācilindika cloth. This tree had supported the mothers of previous
                        victorious ones, and it had been praised in the poetry of the gods. [83] It was a tree to which the
                        wholesome and peaceful gods of the pure realms would bow down and touch with their heads, including their
                        topknots and diadems. Now the queen and her retinue had arrived at this pure and stainless fig tree.</p>

                        bow down and pay homage to him. Māyādevī stretched out her right arm, like a flash of lightning appearing
                        in the middle of the sky, and grasped a branch of the tree. She auspiciously directed her gaze into the

                        and filling the beings there with happiness.” Finally he took seven steps uphill, lifted his gaze, and

                        of saṃsāra and remove the thorns of misery. They will reach a place of supreme joy and genuinely take
                        refuge. As appropriate objects for others’ generosity, they are worthy recipients of offerings. These

                        Why is that? It is because they have faith in the teachings of the thus-gone ones, which go against all

                        ministers and some other boys to visit a farming village. After seeing the village, he entered a park at
                        the edge of the fields. The Bodhisattva wandered around there in complete solitude. As he was strolling
                        through the park, he saw a beautiful and pleasant rose apple tree, and he decided to sit down cross-legged
                        under its shade. Seated there, the Bodhisattva attained a one-pointed state of mind. [129]</p>

                    <p tid="693">He then settled into the first meditative concentration, which is free of factors connected with
                        evil deeds and nonvirtues. It is accompanied by thought and analysis and is imbued with the joy and
                        pleasure born of discernment.</p>
                    <p tid="694">He then brought about the cessation of thoughts and analysis <ref cRef="F.68.b"/> and became
                        perfectly quiet. As his mind became concentrated, he settled into the second meditative concentration,
                        which is free of thought and analysis and is imbued with the joy and pleasure born of meditative
                        absorption.</p>
                    <p tid="695">Without any attachment to joy, he remained in equanimity with mindfulness and introspection and
                        experienced physical pleasure. Aware and cognizant, he felt physically at ease. He had settled into the
                        third meditative concentration, which is without joy: “impartial, aware, and abiding at ease,” as the
                        noble ones describe it.</p>
                    <p tid="696">He had already relinquished suffering and, as he now abandoned the feeling of comfort, both
                        mental pleasure and displeasure vanished. Thus he settled into the fourth meditative concentration:
                        perfectly pristine with impartiality and mindfulness, unconnected with pleasure or pain.</p>

                    <p tid="747">“Your Majesty, you know that the priests who are skilled in making predictions, as well as the
                        gods who have definite knowledge, have foretold that if Prince Sarvārthasiddha renounces the household, he
                        will become a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a completely perfect buddha. Yet if he does not renounce the
                        household, he will become a universal monarch, a righteous Dharma king who has conquered the four quarters
                        and is equipped with the seven treasures. The seven treasures that will be his are the precious wheel, the
                        precious elephant, the precious horse, the precious wife, the precious jewel, <ref cRef="F.71.b"/> the
                        precious steward, and the precious minister. He will have one thousand sons, all of them full, fierce
                        warriors with well-built bodies that destroy the armies of the enemy. He will conquer the entire earth
                        without the use of violence or weapons, and then he will rule [137] according to the Dharma. Therefore we
                        must arrange a marriage for the prince. Once he is surrounded by a group of women, he will discover
                        pleasure and not renounce the household. In that way the line of our universal monarchy will not be cut,
                        and we will be irreproachably respected by all the kings of the realm.”</p>

                        “You are to determine who among the boys here is superior in knowledge of numbers.”</p>
                    <p tid="817">First the Bodhisattva proposed a mathematical problem. One of the Śākya boys tried to calculate
                        it, but he could not solve it. Next another Śākya boy, then two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty,
                        forty, fifty, a hundred—up to five hundred of them—together tried to calculate the problem, but they could
                        not solve it.</p>

                    <p tid="818">Next the Bodhisattva said, “Now you propose a mathematical problem, and I will calculate it.” One
                        of the Śākya boys proposed a mathematical problem to the Bodhisattva, but the boy could not confound the
                        Bodhisattva’s calculations. Next two of the Śākya boys, then three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty,
                        forty, fifty—up to five hundred of them—together proposed a mathematical problem, but they could not
                        confound the Bodhisattva’s calculations.</p>
                    <p tid="819">Finally the Bodhisattva said, “Enough with this dispute! All of you should convene and propose a
                        mathematical problem for me. Then I will calculate it.” Accordingly five hundred Śākya boys [147] in
                        unison proposed an unprecedented problem, and still the Bodhisattva calculated it without any
                        consternation. In this way all the Śākya boys met their match while the Bodhisattva remained undefeated.

                        Śuddhodana. As he was sleeping, King Śuddhodana dreamed that the Bodhisattva was leaving the palace in the
                        quiet of the night, [186] surrounded by a host of gods. As the Bodhisattva left the palace, the king saw
                        that he had become ordained and was wearing the saffron-colored robes.</p>
                    <p tid="1087">As soon as the king awoke, he immediately asked the chamberlain, “Is the young prince with the

                        surely leave us soon, as these omens foretell.” As a sharp pain shot through his heart, he began to
                        scheme: “My young prince must never even set foot in the palace gardens. He must always remain inside with
                        the maidens so that he will be addicted to their pleasures. He must never leave us!”</p>

                        the Rainy Season Palace was both cool and warm, and the Winter Palace was naturally warm. At each palace
                        five hundred guardsmen walked up and down the staircase. While they were ascending and descending the
                        stairs, their calls could be heard for a distance of half a league. Everyone thought, “The young prince
                        will never be able to leave without being noticed.”</p>

                        “The young prince will leave through the Gate of Auspiciousness.” So the king had massive door panels
                        fitted into the Gate of Auspiciousness, so large that it took five hundred men to open and close each of
                        them. The calls of these five hundred men could be heard half a league away. The king provided the palaces
                        with the five desirable things, the likes of which had never been seen before. There were constantly young
                        maidens around the Bodhisattva, playing their instruments, singing songs, and dancing for him.</p>

                        surrounded by women. That way he can really enjoy amorous delights and surely he will not leave us

                        unstable. They do not endure and are subject to change. Like the rapids of a mountain torrent, they
                        quickly pass and are turbulent. Like dewdrops, they do not last. Like an empty fist that tricks a child,
                        they have no substance. Like the core of a plantain tree, they have no strength. Like a vase of unbaked
                        clay, they naturally break. Like autumn clouds, they appear one moment and vanish the next. Like a flash
                        of lightning in the sky, they last for just the briefest time. Like a vessel filled with poison, they
                        cause pain. Like poison ivy, they bring discomfort.</p>

                        water bubbles, always changing. Like a mirage, they are caused by mistaken perception. They are like a
                        hallucination that has come about through false thinking. Just like dreams, they cannot satisfy, since one
                        is grasping at a false appearance. Just as it is difficult to fill the oceans, desires can never be
                        fulfilled. Like salty water, objects of desire only make you thirstier. Like the head of a viper, they are
                        dangerous to touch. [213] Like a deep abyss, they are abandoned entirely by wise people. They produce
                        anxiety, cause strife, and generate distress and faults. Knowing this, the wise ones avoid them, the
                        clever ones deplore them, the noble ones abhor them, and the intelligent ones disparage them. Yet the
                        ignorant embrace them, and the immature rely on them.”</p>

                    <p tid="1363">Monks, once the Bodhisattva had left his home, he crossed over the lands of the Śākyas, the
                        Kroḍyas, and the Mallas. When day broke, he had arrived six leagues away from the town of Anumaineya in
                        the country of Maineya. There he dismounted from his horse Kaṇṭhaka and, once he was on the ground, he
                        dismissed the great assembly of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and
                        mahoragas. Then he thought to himself, “I should entrust these ornaments and the horse Kaṇṭhaka to Chanda,
                        and then send him back.”</p>
                    <p tid="1364">So he summoned Chanda and told him, “Chanda, you should go back now. Take these ornaments and my
                        horse Kaṇṭhaka and return to the palace.”</p>
                    <p tid="1365">At the place where Chanda left the Bodhisattva in order to return home, a memorial was later
                        built. <ref cRef="F.112.a"/> This memorial is still known today as “Chanda’s Return.”</p>

                    <p tid="1366">The Bodhisattva then thought to himself, “With my hair this long, I cannot be a monk.” So he
                        took his sword, cut off his hair, and then cast it into the air. The gods in the Heaven of the
                        Thirty-Three collected the hair for worship. Even to this day the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three
                        celebrate this event during the Hair Festival. At this very place another memorial was built, which today
                        is still known as “Receipt of the Hair.”</p>

                    <p tid="1367">Again the Bodhisattva considered, “If I am to be a monk, it would not be right to wear silken
                        garments. So it would be good if I could find some clothes suitable for living in the forest.” [226]</p>
                    <p tid="1368">The gods of the pure realms then thought, “The Bodhisattva needs saffron-colored robes.”
                        Immediately a god left and manifested in front of the Bodhisattva in the form of a hunter wearing
                        saffron-colored cloth.</p>
                    <p tid="1369">The Bodhisattva asked the god, “My friend, would you give me your saffron-colored robes? Then I
                        will give you my silken garments.”</p>
                    <p tid="1370">The god replied, “Your clothes already suit you well, and I am happy with what I wear.”</p>
                    <p tid="1371">But the Bodhisattva insisted: “Please, I beg you.”</p>

                    <p tid="1372">The god, still in the shape of a hunter, then gave his saffron-colored clothes to the
                        Bodhisattva, while he himself took the Bodhisattva’s silken garments. Because the god was overcome with
                        devotion to the Bodhisattva, he touched the garments to his head, holding them with both of his hands.
                        Then he returned to the celestial world in order to render offerings and veneration to the garments there.
                        Chanda had witnessed the exchange of clothes, and later a memorial was erected at the site. This memorial
                        is still known today as the “Memorial of Receiving the Saffron-Colored Cloth.” <ref cRef="F.112.b"/>

                        gods felt joyous, pleased, and elated. Happy and delighted, they called out cries of joy and
                        exclaimed,</p>
                    <p tid="1374">“Friends, Prince Siddhārtha has left his home! Friends, Prince Siddhārtha has become a monk! He

                        liberate from birth the infinite number of beings who are born. Then he will free them from old age,
                        death, sickness, pain, lamentation, suffering, depression, and distress, and ferry them to the other shore
                        of the ocean of saṃsāra. He will establish them in the realm of phenomena, which is blissful, peaceful,

                        they were unable to. These ornaments were made for someone with a body as strong as Nārāyaṇa, and so other

                    <p tid="1469">Monks, I then thought to myself, “Ārāḍa’s teaching does not bring freedom. It would not bring
                        total freedom from suffering for either of us. So now I must depart and search for a better practice.”

                    <p tid="1470">Monks, since I had now stayed in Vaiśālī for as long as I found enjoyable, I proceeded to the
                        country of Magadha and found my way to Rājagṛha, the capital city of that country. Once there I took up
                        residence at Pāṇḍava, the king of mountains, where I stayed on its slope alone in solitude without any
                        company. At that time many trillions of gods protected me. [240]</p>
                    <p tid="1471">One morning I dressed in the skirt and robes of a mendicant and, holding my offering bowl, I
                        went into the city of Rājagṛha through the Gate of Warm Water and started my alms round. I looked ahead
                        and to both sides and proceeded in a gracious manner, moving my limbs with elegance. I carried the skirt,
                        the offering bowl, and the monk’s robes in a very beautiful manner. My senses were undistracted and my
                        mind was not diverted by outer events. Like an image of someone who is carrying a vase filled with oil, I
                        looked ahead at a distance of six feet.</p>
                    <p tid="1472">When the people of Rājagṛha saw me, they were amazed and thought, “Goodness, is that Brahmā? Or
                        perhaps Śakra, king of the gods, or Vaiśravaṇa? Or is it some kind of mountain god?”</p>

                    <p tid="1510">Monks, at that time a son of Rāma by the name of Rudraka arrived in Rājagṛha, where he stayed
                        with a large group of seven hundred of his students. He was teaching his students the principles of the
                        disciplined conduct necessary for attaining the state where there is neither perception nor nonperception.

                    </p>
                    <p tid="1511">Monks, the Bodhisattva saw that Rudraka, the son of Rāma, was in charge of a group, indeed a
                        large group, and that as the head of the congregation, he was well-known, popular, venerated by the
                        masses, and recognized by all scholars. Witnessing this, the Bodhisattva thought to himself:</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-1197"/>
                    <p tid="1512">“Rudraka, the son of Rāma, is really in charge of a group, indeed a large group; he is the head
                        of the congregation and, moreover, well-known, popular, venerated by the masses, and recognized by all
                        scholars. [244] However, unless I begin to practice disciplined conduct and austerities myself in his
                        presence, he will never perceive me as someone special. He will also not have an understanding based on
                        direct perception. In this way he will never renounce his concentration, absorption, and states of
                        equilibrium, which are fabricated, defiled, and perpetuating.</p>
                    <p tid="1513">“Therefore I must first actualize these experiences myself. In that way I can demonstrate that
                        his worldly absorptions, which are limited to concentration and which only support states of equilibrium,
                        do not carry a result. I will go to Rudraka, the son of Rāma, and become accepted as his student in order
                        to demonstrate the superiority of the qualities of my own absorption. I will demonstrate to him that
                        fabricated absorptions are pointless.”</p>

                    <p tid="1514">Monks, with this purpose in mind, the Bodhisattva went to see Rudraka, the son of Rāma. When he
                        met Rudraka, the Bodhisattva asked, “My friend, who is your teacher? Who taught you so well?”</p>
                    <p tid="1515">Rudraka, the son of Rāma, answered, “My friend, I did not have a teacher. Nevertheless I did
                        reach a genuine understanding on my own.”</p>
                    <p tid="1516">The Bodhisattva then asked, “What is it you understand?”</p>
                    <p tid="1517">Rudraka replied, “The way of equilibrium, which is neither perception nor nonperception.” <ref cRef="F.120.b"/>
                    </p>
                    <p tid="1518">Next the Bodhisattva asked, “Could you please allow me to follow you so that I can obtain the

                    <p tid="1519">Rudraka replied, “Yes indeed, I will let you follow me so that you can obtain instructions for
                        my path of absorption.”</p>

                    <p tid="1520">With this the Bodhisattva went off and sat down with his legs crossed. Now, no sooner did the
                        Bodhisattva sit down before he actualized hundreds of all the main types of worldly and transcendent
                        equilibriums in all their many details. [245] The reason he could do this was because he had become a
                        master of his mind, possessing a superior accumulation of merit and wisdom, a special fruition of all his
                        previous trainings, and a distinctive familiarity with all absorptions.</p>
                    <p tid="1521">At that point the Bodhisattva arose from his seat, mindful and attentive, and went to see
                        Rudraka, the son of Rāma. He then addressed him: “My friend, is there any higher path than the state of
                        neither perception nor nonperception?”</p>
                    <p tid="1522">“No,” Rudraka replied.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-1200"/>
                    <p tid="1523">The Bodhisattva then thought to himself, “Rudraka is not the only one who has faith, diligence,
                        mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. I am also faithful, diligent, mindful, concentrated, and wise.” He
                        therefore addressed Rudraka with these words: “My friend, I have now understood the teaching in which you
                        are adept.”</p>
                    <p tid="1524">Rudraka replied, “Well, in that case, come, we should teach everyone together.” And accordingly
                        he installed the Bodhisattva as a teacher on the same level as himself.</p>
                    <p tid="1525">The Bodhisattva then said, “My friend, this path does not free the mind. Neither does it free
                        one from attachment. It also does not lead to cessation or peace. It does not bring higher knowledge, nor
                        does it lead to complete awakening. <ref cRef="F.121.a"/> It does not make one a mendicant or a priest,
                        and it does not lead to nirvāṇa.”</p>
                    <p tid="1526">Monks, in this way the Bodhisattva made up his mind regarding Rudraka, the son of Rāma, and his
                        followers. He left them, saying, “This is enough; I am leaving.”</p>

                    <p tid="1527">At that point there were five ascetic companions who were learning religious practices under the
                        guidance of Rudraka, the son of Rāma. They thought to themselves, “Even though we have tried and persisted
                        for a long time in this way, we have not been able to realize our goal. Yet this mendicant Gautama was
                        able to realize it and manifest it through such little hardship. And now he doesn’t want it! Surely he
                        must be searching for something even higher than that. Surely he will become a teacher of the world.
                        Whatever he is about to discover, he will probably share it with us.” And with this, the five ascetic
                        companions left Rudraka, the son of Rāma, to follow the Bodhisattva instead. [246]</p>

                    <p tid="1528">Monks, by that point the Bodhisattva had remained in Rājagṛha for as long as he wanted, and now
                        he left together with the five ascetic companions in order to wander through the kingdom of Magadha.
                        Somewhere on the road between Rājagṛha and Gaya, they met a group of people who were enjoying a feast.
                        This group called out to the Bodhisattva and the five ascetic companions and invited them to sit down and
                        participate in the feast.</p>
                    <p tid="1529">Monks, afterward the Bodhisattva proceeded through Magadha and eventually arrived at Gaya. At
                        the peak of Mount Gaya, the Bodhisattva stayed in order to apply himself to strenuous practice. As he was
                        staying there, three parables that he had never previously heard or thought of came to his mind. What were
                        these three?</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-1203"/>
                    <p tid="1530">First he thought, “There are some monks and priests who are unable to separate their mind and
                        body from the objects of their desire. Instead they delight in those objects and feel attached to them,
                        long for them, wish for them, strive for them, crave and thirst for them, become senseless for them, and
                        are burned by them. This striving after the objects of desire never brings peace. They further harm
                        themselves and torment their bodies and end up with intense and unbearable feelings of suffering.
                        Therefore, in doing so, they become incapable of actualizing the noble wisdom vision that is superior to
                        any human teaching. This is like a person who tries in vain to create a fire in order to make light by
                        rubbing together two wet pieces of wood that have been submerged in water. He will not be able to produce

                        body from the objects of their desire. They delight in those objects and feel attached to them, long for
                        them, wish for them, strive for them, crave and thirst for them, become senseless for them, and are burned

                        superior to any human teaching.” This was the first example that he had never thought or heard of that
                        came to the Bodhisattva’s mind.</p>

                    <p tid="1531">Second, he continued to think, “There are also monks and priests who have separated their mind
                        and body from the objects of their desire. Still they delight in those objects and feel attached to them,
                        long for them, wish for them, strive for them, crave and thirst for them, become senseless for them, and
                        are burned by them. This striving after the objects of desire never brings peace. <ref cRef="F.122.a"/>
                        They further harm themselves and torment their bodies and end up with intense and unbearable feelings of

                        superior to any human teaching. This is like a person who tries in vain to create a fire in order to make

                        will be unable to produce fire and make light. This is the same as some monks and priests who have

                        them to the extent that they never find peace. In this way they harm themselves and torment their bodies
                        and end up with intense and unbearable feelings of suffering, as if being burned. Therefore, in doing so,
                        they become incapable of actualizing the noble wisdom vision that is much supreme to the highest human
                        teaching.” This was the second example that he had never thought or heard of that came to the

                    <p tid="1532">Third, he thought, “There are also other monks and priests who have separated their mind and

                        intense and unbearable feelings of suffering, in doing so they do become capable of actualizing the noble
                        wisdom vision that is superior to human teaching. They are like a person who wishes to create a fire in

                        wood against it. For such a person the fire will ignite, and light will shine. This is how there are also
                        other monks and priests who have separated their mind and body from the objects of their desire. Although

                        practices. The reason for calling this <distinct>difficult practice</distinct> is because it is
                        excruciatingly difficult, and therefore it is described in such terms. Except for a bodhisattva who has
                        reached his last existence and rests in equanimity in all-pervasive absorption, there is no one, human or
                        nonhuman, who is capable of undergoing such hardships. This absorption is called
                            <distinct>all-pervasive</distinct> because as the Bodhisattva rested in equanimity in the fourth
                        absorption, from the very beginning all movements of the breath slowed down and ceased, and the absorption
                        was nonconceptual. There was no thought, no movement, no conceptual mind, and no change, yet it was
                        all-pervading and not dependent on anything. Previously no student, master, solitary buddha, or
                        bodhisattva who had taken up such conduct had ever entered this absorption. This absorption is likened to
                        space, because like space—which is motionless, uncaused, and changeless—there is nowhere it cannot reach.
                        In that way it is similar to space, and therefore it is described as such.</p>

                        no need to worry; your hardship will pay off. Renouncing the world for the sake of awakening is indeed
                        meaningful. What the priest Asita predicted shall come true. Likewise the prediction of Dīpaṃkara shall

                        may fall into the ocean. The sun, the moon, and the stars may fall to the ground. Yet although I am an

                        true knowledge that would be higher than manmade teachings. This path does not lead to awakening. This
                        path is incapable of eradicating the continuation of birth, old age, and death in the future. But there
                        must be another path to awakening that can eradicate the future suffering of birth, old age, and

                    <p tid="1639">Monks, I continued to think, <ref cRef="F.130.a"/> “Once, when I was sitting in my father’s park
                        under the shade of a rose apple tree, I rejoiced as I attained the first level of concentration, which is
                        free from desires and negativities, endued with good qualities, reflective, investigative, and full of joy
                        born out of discrimination. I rejoiced as I attained the levels of concentration up to the fourth. That,
                        indeed, must be the path to awakening, which can eradicate the arising of the sufferings of birth, old
                        age, sickness, and death. And so a conviction was born in me: ‘This is the path to awakening!’ ”</p>
                    <p tid="1640">Again I thought, “Yet this path cannot be realized by someone who has grown so weak. If I were
                        to proceed toward the seat of awakening merely by the power of my supernatural knowledge but with my body
                        so critically weak, [264] future beings would not be disposed favorably toward me, and this path would not
                        lead to awakening. Therefore I shall begin to eat solid food again. That way I can regain my physical
                        strength. Once I do so, I will proceed to the seat of awakening.”</p>

                    <p tid="1641">Monks, at that point some gods felt concern for me. Since they knew my thoughts, they came to
                        where I was staying and told me, “Holy Man, don’t eat solid food! We can give you nourishment through the
                        pores of your body.”</p>
                    <p tid="1642">Monks, I then thought, “I took a vow to remain fasting. And in this way the people in the

                        gods were to grant me nourishment through the pores of my body, I would be the worst of hypocrites.”</p>
                    <p tid="1643">The Bodhisattva therefore decided to disregard the words of the gods in order to avoid
                        hypocrisy. Instead he decided to begin eating solid foods. Monks, in this way the Bodhisattva arose from
                        the seat where he had practiced discipline and hardship for the past six years, <ref cRef="F.130.b"/> and
                        he proclaimed, “I will now eat solid foods, such as molasses, pea soup, lentil soup, porridge, and

                        higher than manmade teachings. Yet how can eating solid foods and leading a comfortable life be of any

                        of Making Use of Others’ Emanations, and finally all the way to the Brahma realm. Monks, at that time, at
                        that moment, at that very instant, this message resounded and traveled all the way to Highest Heaven:
                        “Friends, here is a descendent of a great royal clan. He has abandoned his kingdom of a universal monarch,

                        on that spot a lotus pond appeared. Still to this day, this pond is known as “The Pond Where the

                        kakubha tree. In order to follow the worldly custom and to please the goddess of that tree, the
                        Bodhisattva called out to her, “Listen, goddess, lower one of your branches!” The goddess lowered a branch
                        and, as the Bodhisattva grasped it, he was lifted out of the pond. Once he was free, he remained under the
                        shade of the kakubha tree, where he sewed the dusty rag into the robes of a monk. Today this place is

                    <p tid="1657">At midnight the gods announced the following to Sujātā, daughter of the villager Nandika, in the
                        village Senāpati in Urubilvā: “The one for whom you have been making offerings has relaxed his discipline
                        and decided that he will once again eat nourishing and solid food. Previously you made the aspiration,
                        ‘May the Bodhisattva take my food and thereby truly attain perfect and completely unexcelled awakening!’
                        Now that time has come, so you must do what you ought to be doing.” <ref cRef="F.132.a"/>

                    <p tid="1658">Monks, as soon as Sujātā, daughter of the villager Nandika, heard these words of the gods, she
                        quickly gathered the milk of a thousand cows. Seven times she skimmed the cream from the milk, until she
                        obtained a thick, strength-giving cream. She then poured this cream into a new clay pot, mixed it with the
                        freshest rice, and placed it on a brand-new stove. As the milk porridge was cooking, various omens
                        manifested. [268] Within the milk appeared the contours of an endless knot, a simple swastika, an
                        elaborate swastika, a lotus, a vardhamāna, and other auspicious signs. Upon seeing this, Sujātā thought to
                        herself, “The appearance of these signs surely means that the Bodhisattva will now take food and obtain
                        unexcelled, perfect, and complete awakening.” At that time a fortuneteller versed in ritual and the art of
                        reading signs came to the village and prophesied that someone would attain immortality there.</p>

                    <p tid="1659">When Sujātā had finished cooking the porridge, she placed it on the ground where, full of
                        devotion, she had already prepared a seat for the Bodhisattva by scattering flowers and perfumed water.
                        She then told one of her servants, a woman named Uttarā, “Uttarā, go and fetch the priest. I will stay
                        here and look after this milk porridge with honey.”</p>
                    <p tid="1660">“Very well, my lady,” answered Uttarā, who then did as she was told. She went off in the eastern
                        direction, but there she met only the Bodhisattva. She then went south, but there as well she met the
                        Bodhisattva. Then she went west and north, but in those places as well she encountered the Bodhisattva. At
                        that time some gods from the pure realms had removed all the extremist practitioners, and now none of them
                        were to be found.</p>

                        meet is that beautiful monk. Other than him, there are no monks or priests!”</p>
                    <p tid="1662">Sujātā said, “He alone is the monk, he alone is the priest! It is for his sake that I have
                        prepared this meal. Go, Uttarā, and fetch him.”</p>
                    <p tid="1663">“Very well, my lady,” said Uttarā, and off she went. When she met the Bodhisattva, she bowed at
                        his feet and conveyed Sujātā’s invitation to him. <ref cRef="F.132.b"/>

                        the seat that had been prepared for him. Monks, the village girl Sujātā then filled a golden vessel with
                        the milk porridge and honey and offered it to the Bodhisattva. [269]</p>
                    <p tid="1665">The Bodhisattva then had this thought: “Sujātā has offered this food, and if I eat it now, there
                        is no doubt that I shall truly attain perfect and completely unexcelled awakening.” Then the Bodhisattva
                        had his meal. When he was done, he got up and asked Sujātā, “Sister, what should I do with the golden
                        bowl?”</p>
                    <p tid="1666">“Please take it with you,” she replied.</p>
                    <p tid="1667">The Bodhisattva told her, “I don’t need this bowl.”</p>
                    <p tid="1668">Sujātā then told him, “Well then, do as you please. But I do not give food to anyone without

                        Nairañjanā River, the river of nāgas. He put down his bowl and rope and entered the water to refresh
                        himself. Monks, while the Bodhisattva was bathing, several hundred thousand gods came to venerate him.
                        They poured divine aloe and sandalwood powder as well as various ointments into the river, and they
                        scattered divine flowers of all colors onto the water. In this way the whole great Nairañjanā River flowed
                        on full of divine perfumes and flowers that rained down. Many trillion gods came to collect the perfumed
                        water that the Bodhisattva had used for bathing. They brought it with them to their own abodes in order to
                        enshrine it in memorials and venerate it. The village girl Sujātā also collected all the hair and the
                        beard of the Bodhisattva. Thinking that it must be sacred, <ref cRef="F.133.a"/> she took it with her in

                        suitable place on the riverbank. Right then, a nāga girl who lived in the Nairañjanā River emerged out of
                        the earth’s surface and offered the Bodhisattva a throne made of jewels.</p>
                    <p tid="1671">The Bodhisattva took his seat there and, while he was thinking fondly of the village girl
                        Sujātā, he drank what he needed of the milk porridge made with honey. When he was done with his meal, he
                        threw the golden bowl into the water without any feelings of attachment. As soon as the bowl hit the
                        water, the nāga king Sāgara, full of devotion and great respect, came to fetch the bowl and bring it to
                        his kingdom, thinking, “This is worthy of veneration!”</p>

                        In this heaven he started a religious festival called The Procession of the Bowl, observed on the days of

                        displays at the seat of awakening. The Bodhisattva himself, however, caused all the displays that
                        ornamented all the seats of awakening of the past, present, and future buddhas in all the buddha realms in
                        the ten directions to become visible right there at the seat of awakening.</p>
                    <p tid="1830">Monks, as the Bodhisattva now sat at the seat of awakening, he thought to himself, “Māra is the
                        supreme lord who holds sway over the desire realm, the most powerful and evil demon. <ref cRef="F.147.b"/>
                        [300] There is no way that I could attain unsurpassed and complete awakening without his knowledge. So I
                        will now arouse that evil Māra. Once I have conquered him, all the gods in the desire realm will also be
                        restrained. Moreover, there are some gods in Māra’s retinue who have previously created some basic
                        goodness. When they witness my lion-like display, they will direct their minds toward unsurpassed and
                        complete awakening.”</p>

                        light illuminated all demonic abodes in the entire great trichiliocosm, making them dark by comparison and
                        causing them to shake. In fact the entire great trichiliocosm was bathed in an immense light.</p>

                        triumphed in the face of battle, and raised high the parasols, standards, and banners of conquest, he
                        settled into the first meditative concentration. That state is free from desires, free of factors
                        connected with evil deeds and nonvirtues, accompanied by thought and analysis, and imbued with the joy and
                        pleasure born of discernment.</p>
                    <p tid="2150">When he had brought about the cessation of thought and analysis, he became perfectly quiet in
                        and of himself, and therefore his mind became concentrated. Through this he settled into the second
                        meditative concentration, which is free of thought and analysis and is imbued with the joy and pleasure
                        born of meditative absorption.</p>

                        which is unconnected with joy. The noble ones call such a person [344] <distinct>the impartial one

                        intellect. Only wise noble ones and adepts can understand it. It is the complete and definitive

                        freedom from a foundation. It is a state of complete peace, free of clinging, free of grasping,
                        unobserved, undemonstrable, uncompounded, beyond the six sense fields, inconceivable, unimaginable, and
                        ineffable. It is indescribable, inexpressible, and incapable of being illustrated. It is unobstructed,
                        beyond all references, a state of interruption through the path of tranquility, and imperceptible like
                        emptiness. It is the exhaustion of craving and it is cessation free of desire. It is nirvāṇa. If I were to
                        teach this truth to others, they would not understand it. Teaching the truth would tire me out and be
                        wrongly contested, and it would be futile. Thus I will remain silent and keep this truth in my heart.”</p>

                        making the trichiliocosm tremble. In due course, passing through the country of Magadha, he set off on his
                        way to Kāśi. In Gaya, not far from the seat of awakening, an Ājīvika mendicant spotted him from afar.
                        Seeing the Thus-Gone One approaching, he came up to him and stood to one side.</p>

                        pure, and of yellow hue. Just as the autumn season, which is white and bright, becomes of yellow hue, so

                        round face. Just as a necklace made of gold from the Jambū River, whose surface has the excellence of a

                        of vivid color, resplendent, perfectly pure, and exceedingly bright, just so, Venerable Gautama, are your
                        calmed senses, bright skin color, and your perfectly pure round face. Venerable Gautama, with whom did you
                        practice religion?”</p>

                        There really are!”</p>

                        monarch. The second great merit results in becoming a supreme ruler in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings.
                        The third great merit results in becoming Śakra, lord of the gods. The fourth great merit results in
                        becoming the god Suyāma. The fifth great merit results in becoming Santuṣita. The sixth great merit
                        results in becoming Sunirmāṇarati. The seventh great merit results in becoming Vaśavartin, the king of
                        gods. The eighth great merit results in becoming Brahmā from the Mahā-Brahmā Heaven. Finally one becomes a
                        thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfectly awakened one, free from all unvirtuous dharmas and endowed with
                        all the virtuous ones. These are the eight great merits that one will attain. [442]</p>
