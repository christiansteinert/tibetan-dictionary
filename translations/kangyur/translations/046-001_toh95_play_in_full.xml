                    attained awakening, as perceived from the perspective of the Great Vehicle. The sūtra, which is structured in
                    twenty-seven chapters, first presents the events surrounding the Buddha’s birth, childhood, and adolescence in
                    the royal palace of his father, king of the Śākya nation. It then recounts his escape from the palace and the
                    years of hardship he faced in his quest for spiritual awakening. Finally the sūtra reveals his complete
                    victory over the demon Māra, his attainment of awakening under the Bodhi tree, his first turning of the wheel
                    of Dharma, and the formation of the very early saṅgha.</p>

                        a doubt one of the most important sūtras within Buddhist Mahāyāna literature. With parts of the text
                        dating from the earliest days of the Buddhist tradition, this story of the Buddha’s awakening has
                        captivated the minds of devotees, both ordained and lay, as far back as the beginning of the common
                        era.</p>

                    <p tid="8">In brief, <title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title> tells the story of how the Buddha
                        manifested in this world and attained awakening. The sūtra, which is structured in twenty-seven chapters,
                        begins with the Buddha being requested to teach the sūtra by several gods, as well as the thousands of
                        bodhisattvas and hearers in his retinue. The gods summarize the sūtra in this manner (chap. 1):</p>
                    <q>
                        <p tid="9"> “Blessed One, there is an extensive collection of discourses on the Dharma that bears the name
                                <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Lalitavistara</title> (<title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title>).
                            This teaching illuminates the basic virtues of the bodhisattvas, showing how the Bodhisattva descended
                            from the sublime palace in the Heaven of Joy, intentionally entered the womb, and sojourned in the
                            womb. It shows the power of the place where he was born to a noble family, and how he surpassed others
                            through all the superior special qualities that he demonstrated through his actions as a youth. It
                            shows his many unique qualities, such as his skills in arts, crafts, writing, arithmetic,
                            calculations, astrology, fencing, archery, feats of physical strength, and wrestling, demonstrating
                            his superiority to all others in these areas. It shows how he enjoyed his retinue of consorts and the
                            pleasures of his kingdom. </p>
                        <p tid="10"> “This teaching proclaims how he attained the result brought about by the concordant cause of
                            all the bodhisattva activities, showing how he manifested as a bodhisattva and destroyed the legions
                            of Māra. It explains the ten powers, the fourfold fearlessness, and the other innumerable qualities of
                            a thus-gone one, and presents the infinite teachings taught by the thus-gone ones of times past.” </p>
                    </q>
                    <p tid="11">The Buddha silently accepts this request, and the following day he commences the teaching.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-5"/>
                    <p tid="12">The story begins in the divine realms where the future Buddha (who, prior to his awakening, is
                        known as the Bodhisattva) enjoys a perfect life surrounded by divine pleasures. Due to his past
                        aspirations, however, the musical instruments of the palace call out to him, reminding him of his prior
                        commitment to attain awakening (chap. 2). Inspired by this reminder, the Bodhisattva announces, to the
                        despair of the gods, that he will abandon his divine pleasures in pursuit of full and complete awakening
                        on this earth (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Jambudvīpa</foreign>), where he will take birth within a
                        suitably noble family (chap. 3). However, before his departure from the heavenly realms, the Bodhisattva
                        delivers one final teaching to the gods (chap. 4) and, having installed the bodhisattva Maitreya as his
                        regent, he sets out for the human realm accompanied by great displays of divine offerings and auspicious
                        signs (chap. 5). He enters the human world via the <term type="ignore">womb</term> of Queen Māyā, where he
                        resides for the duration of the pregnancy within an exquisite temple, enjoying the happiness of absorption
                        (chap. 6).</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-6"/>
                    <p tid="13">After taking birth in the Lumbinī Grove and declaring his intention to attain complete awakening
                        (chap. 7), we follow the infant Bodhisattva on a temple visit where the stone statues rise up to greet him
                        (chap. 8) and hear of the marvelous jewelry that his father, the king, commissions for him (chap. 9).
                        Next, as the Bodhisattva matures, the sūtra recounts his first day at school, where he far surpasses even
                        the most senior tutors (chap. 10); his natural attainment of the highest levels of meditative
                        concentration during a visit to the countryside (chap. 11); and his incredible prowess in the traditional
                        worldly arts, which he uses to win the hand of Gopā, a Śākya girl whose father requires proof of the
                        Bodhisattva’s <term type="ignore">qualities</term> as a proper husband (chap. 12).</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-7"/>
                    <p tid="14">The Bodhisattva has now reached maturity and can enjoy life in the palace, where he is surrounded
                        by all types of pleasure, including a large harem to entertain him. Seeing this, the gods begin to worry
                        that he will never leave such a luxurious life, and they therefore gently remind him of his vows to awaken
                        (chap. 13). This reminder, however, turns out to be unnecessary, as the Bodhisattva is far from attached
                        to such fleeting pleasures. Instead, to the great despair of everyone in the Śākya kingdom, he renounces
                        his royal pleasures. Inspired by the sight of a sick person, an old man, a corpse, and a religious
                        mendicant (chap. 14), he departs from the palace to begin the life of a religious seeker on a spiritual
                        journey, which eventually leads him to awakening (chap. 15).</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-8"/>
                    <p tid="15">Already at this early stage of his religious career, the Bodhisattva is no ordinary being. It
                        quickly becomes apparent that he surpasses all the foremost spiritual teachers of his day. His
                        extraordinary charisma also attracts many beings, such as the king of Magadha, who requests the
                        Bodhisattva to take up residence in his kingdom, but without success (chap. 16). In a final test of the
                        established contemplative systems of his day, the Bodhisattva next follows Rudraka, a renowned spiritual
                        teacher. But once again he is disappointed, although he quickly masters the prescribed trainings.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-9"/>
                    <p tid="16">These experiences lead the Bodhisattva to the conclusion that he must discover awakening on his
                        own, so he sets out on a six-year journey of austere practices, which are so extreme in nature that they
                        take him to the brink of death (chap. 17). Finally the Bodhisattva realizes that such practices do not
                        lead to awakening and, encouraged by some protective gods, he begins to eat a normal diet once again,
                        which restores his former physique and health (chap. 18). At this point he senses that he is on the verge
                        of attaining his goal, and therefore sets out for the seat of awakening (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">bodhimaṇḍa</foreign>), the sacred place where all bodhisattvas in their last
                        existence attain full and complete awakening (chap. 19). As he arrives at the seat of awakening, the gods
                        create a variety of impressive miraculous displays, and the place eventually comes to resemble a divine
                        realm, fit for the epic achievement that awaits the Bodhisattva (chap. 20).</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-10"/>
                    <p tid="17">Still, just as everything has been prepared to celebrate the attainment of awakening, Māra, the
                        most powerful demon in the desire realm, arrives with the aim of preventing the Bodhisattva from attaining
                        his goal. Together with his terrifying army and seductive daughters, Māra tries every trick in the book to
                        discourage the Bodhisattva, but to no avail. Sad and dejected, Māra eventually gives up his disgraceful
                        attempt at creating obstacles (chap. 21). Now the stage is finally set for the Bodhisattva to attain
                        awakening under the Bodhi tree, a gradual process that unfolds throughout the night until he fully and
                        perfectly awakens at dawn to become the Awakened One (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Buddha</foreign>), or Thus-Gone One (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Tathāgata</foreign>), as
                        he is known subsequent to his awakening (chap. 22). As is only suitable for such an epic achievement, the
                        entire pantheon of divine beings now hurry to the Thus-Gone One, making offerings and singing his praise
                        (chap. 23).</p>

                    <p tid="18">During the first seven weeks following his awakening, the Buddha keeps to himself and does not
                        teach. In fact he worries that the truth he has discovered might be too profound for others to comprehend,
                        except perhaps a bodhisattva in his last existence. Māra, who senses the Buddha’s dilemma, turns up and
                        tries one last trick, suggesting to the Buddha that perhaps this would be a suitable time to pass straight
                        into parinirvāṇa. The Buddha, however, makes it clear that he has no such plans, and finally Māra relents.
                        During these first seven weeks, we also hear of other encounters between the Buddha and some local
                        passersby, but significantly no teaching is given (chap. 24). Setting up an important example for the
                        tradition, the Buddha eventually consents to teach the Dharma only after it has been requested four times,
                        in this case by all the gods, headed by Brahmā and Śakra. As he says, “O Brahmā, the gates of nectar are
                        opened” (chap. 25).</p>

                    <p tid="19">At this point, the Buddha determines through his higher knowledge that the first people to hear
                        his teaching should be his five former companions from the days when he was practicing austerities.
                        Although these ascetics originally rejected the Bodhisattva when he decided to abandon their path, when
                        they meet the Buddha again at the Deer Park outside of Vārāṇasī, they are rendered helpless by his
                        majestic presence and request teachings from him. The five companions instantly receive ordination and, in
                        a seminal moment, the Buddha teaches them the four truths of the noble ones: suffering, the origin of
                        suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path that leads to the cessation of suffering. Thus this
                        occasion constitutes the birth of the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha (chap. 26).
                        This marks the end of the teaching proper. Finally, in the epilogue, the Buddha encourages his retinue of
                        gods and humans to take this sūtra as their practice and propagate it to the best of their abilities
                        (chap. 27).</p>

                        the qualities of awakening and is fully equipped to influence the world, as he did over the next
                        forty-five years by continuously teaching the Dharma and establishing his community of followers. From our
                        perspective, this may seem odd. Why do we not get to follow the Buddha as he builds his community of <term type="ignore">monks</term> and nuns and interacts with the people of India, high and low, throughout
                        his teaching career? And why do we not get to hear the details of his old age and passing into nirvāṇa?
                        After all, this is the part of his life where his inconceivable qualities are most evident and where his
                        glory as the fully awakened Buddha is most radiant.</p>

                        account is not to describe the life of the Buddha in the way one would expect in a traditional biography,
                        or even a religious hagiography. Instead, the scope of <title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title> may
                        be to tell the story of the complete awakening of a bodhisattva in his last existence. The many events
                        that occurred post awakening during the Buddha’s forty-five-year teaching career are therefore not of
                        particular interest to a project that aims to describe the awakening of a buddha. These events, moreover,
                        are well documented in the teachings preserved elsewhere in the Buddhist canon.</p>

                        rather as an account of the unfolding of awakening itself, clearly centered around the figure of Buddha
                        Śākyamuni, yet with many themes and plots that do not exclusively refer to his particular life example.
                        Although we do hear of events specific to the life of Buddha Śākyamuni in the chapters concerning his
                        education, athletic prowess, and so on, we are often reminded that the main occurrences recounted in
                            <title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title> have unfolded previously, namely whenever past
                        bodhisattvas awoke to the level of a thus-gone one. Thus this story represents nothing new under the sun;
                        instead it recounts what happens to everyone who is in a position such as the Bodhisattva’s.</p>

                        is the ahistorical Mahāyāna backdrop that informs the entire story line. Throughout the text, the story is
                        covered by a latticework of mind-boggling miracles and feats that defy comprehension by the ordinary
                        intellect. Clearly, in the perspective of the Mahāyāna, the world is fashioned according to the lenses
                        that we use to see with. And here, in <title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title>, the lenses are those
                        of full and complete awakening. This fact is already alluded to in the title of the text, which describes
                        the events in the Bodhisattva’s life as a play. As such the events in the Bodhisattva’s life are not
                        ordinary karmic activity that unfold based on the mechanisms of a conceptual mind, but rather the playful
                        manner in which the nonconceptual wisdom of a tenth-level bodhisattva unfolds as an expression of his
                        awakened insight. In this manner of storytelling, the reader is invited into the worldview of a timeless
                        and limitless universe as perceived by the adepts of the Mahāyāna. The time span, numbers, and sizes
                        within this Mahāyāna scripture are so persistently overwhelming that all historical and scientific
                        thinking as we know it eventually loses meaning and relevance.</p>

                        teachings of the Mahāyāna. Thus, to fully appreciate this text, the reader must also attend to its

                        this magnificent religious literature through the lenses of historical awareness and philological

                        before this text appeared in writing, as early scholarship on the sūtra has already pointed out (e.g.,
                        Winternitz 1927). This essential framework, however, was greatly developed and adorned by the sūtra’s
                        compilers/authors in order to create its current form, which Vaidya (1958) has dated to the third century
                        <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. Before that time, stories surrounding the life of the Buddha (and the Bodhisattva in his last and
                        previous existences) were in place in the various canons of the early Buddhist schools. However, the

                    <p tid="26">This scripture is an obvious compilation of various early sources, which have been strung together
                        and elaborated on according to the Mahāyāna worldview. As such this text is a fascinating example of the
                        ways in which the Mahāyāna rests firmly on the earlier tradition, yet reinterprets the very foundations of
                        Buddhism in a way that fits its own vast perspective. The fact that the text is a compilation is initially
                        evident from the mixture of prose and verse that, in some cases, contains strata from the very earliest
                        Buddhist teachings and, in other cases, presents later Buddhist themes that do not emerge—in written form
                        at least—until the first centuries of the common era. Previous scholarship on <title xml:lang="en">The
                            Play in Full</title> (mostly published in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries) devoted
                        much time to determining the text’s potential sources and their respective time periods, although without
                        much success. For example, while the first critical publications argued that the verse sections of the
                        text represent a more ancient origin than the parts written in prose, that theory had largely been
                        dismissed by the beginning of the twentieth century (Winternitz 1927). Although this topic clearly
                        deserves further study, it is interesting to note that hardly any new research on this sūtra has been
                        published during the last sixty years. As such the only thing we can currently say concerning the sources
                        and origin of <title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title> is that it was based on several early and, for
                        the most part, unidentified sources that belong to the very early days of the Buddhist tradition.</p>

                        composed by a single author. In fact it seems that the compilers of the text took <term type="ignore">pride</term> in presenting an account of the Bodhisattva’s last existence that was as detailed and
                        all-encompassing as possible and thus, to this end, it was perfectly acceptable to draw openly on a
                        variety of sources. One obvious example of this is the fact that although the story is for the most part
                        recounted in the third person, it occasionally and abruptly shifts into a first-person narrative where the
                        Buddha recounts the events himself. In addition, there is often a significant overlap between the topics
                        covered in the prose and verse sections, and in these places the compilers of the text have made no
                        attempt to polish away the inconsistencies and redundancies. It is likely that the discerning readers of

                        instances of “the words of the Buddha” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">buddhavacana</foreign>).
                        Certainly the Mahāyāna literature contains many statements in support of such an open-ended approach to

                        further translations appeared, including an English translation by R. L. Mitra in 1875, and most
                        influentially a full French translation by Édouard Foucaux in 1892. Almost a hundred years later,
                        Gwendolyn Bays, who based her work on Foucaux’s translation with reference to the original Sanskrit and
                        Tibetan, published a complete translation in English.</p>

                    <p tid="33">This present translation builds on, and benefits from, the considerable efforts of these previous
                        scholars. Unlike earlier translations, however, we have based our translation on the Tibetan text as found
                        in the Degé Kangyur (Toh 95), with reference to the other available Kangyur editions. In addition we have
                        also compared the Tibetan translation line by line with the Sanskrit (Lefmann 1874), and we have revised
                        the translation on numerous occasions where the Sanskrit clarified obscure passages in the Tibetan version
                        or represented a preferred reading.</p>

                    <p tid="34">As such it is fair to say that this translation as it stands is an equal product of the Tibetan
                        and the Sanskrit. Although some scholars may have preferred a translation from the Sanskrit alone, we
                        believe that the present approach is justified, since a comparative study of the available manuscripts
                        makes it clear that several strands of manuscripts were extant in India, sometimes with significant
                        differences in wording and content. Moreover, as the Tibetan translation predates the existing Sanskrit
                        manuscripts by centuries, the Tibetan may indeed represent an earlier stratum that <term type="ignore">merits</term> attention apart from merely complementing the Sanskrit.</p>

                    <p tid="35">In producing this translation, we have sought to incorporate the best of both manuscript
                        traditions through a diplomatic approach that does not give preference to either language<foreign xml:lang="la"> a priori</foreign>. Since there are literally thousands of differences between the
                        Sanskrit and the Tibetan manuscripts when all levels of variance are considered, we have avoided
                        annotating each individual reading preference in the translation. Our motivation for this has been to
                        present a translation that the general reader can enjoy without getting distracted by numerous
                        philological discussions and annotations that would interest but a few scholarly specialists. Instead, for
                        those who would like to study the translation together with the original manuscripts, we have included
                        references to the page numbers of both the Sanskrit and the Tibetan manuscripts, providing the specialist
                        with an easy means for comparative textual studies. In this way it is our hope that both the general
                        reader and the specialist may find the present translation to be of benefit and inspiration.</p>

                        should ooze fragrant fluids from its temples and have a glorious body. Someone who is learned in the Vedas
                        and scriptures of the priests will then recognize such features and use them to predict the arrival of a

                        What were these eight?</p>

                        been removed. It was <ref cRef="40" type="sanskrit"/> well watered and very clean. It was undisturbed by wind and free from soot and

                        level, like the palm of a hand. This was the first omen.</p>

                        nightingales, pheasants, and many others. The birds had beautiful and delightful wings in many colors and
                        sang in melodious sounds. They perched upon the verandas, turrets, doorways, pavilions, and <ref cRef="F.25.a" type="folio"/> upper terraces of King Śuddhodana’s sublime residence. The birds were joyful and
                        content, and they each sang happily. This was the second omen.</p>

                        and carried fruits of all seasons. This was the third omen.</p>

                        cartwheels, each with many trillions of petals. This was the fourth omen.</p>

                        Then, as the bodhisattvas and many millions of gods, nāgas, and yakṣas assembled around him, he began his
                        departure from the sublime realm of the Heaven of Joy.</p>

                    <p tid="314">Monks, <ref cRef="F.30.a" type="folio"/> as he started to move, the Bodhisattva’s body began to shine with a
                        brilliant and dazzling light that surpassed any other celestial light. This unprecedented light
                        illuminated all the vast and enormous realms of the great trichiliocosm. Even the darkest regions of the
                        world, filled with negativity and obscurity, where even the renowned great power and magical ability of
                        the sun and the moon are unable to produce light, colors, or heat, were bathed in light. In those realms,
                        the unfortunate beings normally cannot even see their own hands. But even there, the dazzling light shone.
                        Due to the light, the beings in those realms now recognized one another and remarked, “Listen, friends!
                        Other beings have also been born here!”</p>
                    <p tid="315">Then the whole billionfold world system shook in six ways and exhibited eighteen great signs. It
                        began to quiver, tremble, quake, move, make sound, and roar, each in three degrees of intensity. <ref cRef="52" type="sanskrit"/> The
                        world shook so violently that its center and edge, east and west, as well as north and south, all bounced
                        around, so that when one side was up, the other was down.</p>

                    <p tid="316">At that point one could hear all sorts of pleasant and cheerful sounds. There were sounds that
                        inspired love and made everyone serene. There were inviting and refreshing sounds that were impossible to
                        describe or imitate, agreeable sounds that do not produce fear. <ref cRef="F.30.b" type="folio"/> At that moment there
                        was not a single being anywhere that felt hostile, frightened, or anxious. At that moment even the light
                        of the sun and moon and the splendor of the gods, such as Śakra, Brahmā, and the world protectors, was
                        eclipsed. All beings who were living in the hells, along with those born as animals and all those in the
                        realm of the lord of death, became instantaneously free from suffering and filled with every happiness. No
                        being had any painful emotion, such as anger, delusion, envy, jealousy, pride, hypocrisy, arrogance,
                        wrath, malice, or burning anguish. At that moment all sentient beings felt love for each other, wished
                        each other well, and saw each other as parents and children.</p>
                    <p tid="317">Trillions of divine and human musical instruments played sweet sounds without even being touched
                        or played. Hundreds of millions of gods lifted and carried that great mansion using their hands,
                        shoulders, and the crowns of their heads. Hundreds of thousands of goddesses each sang songs. From all
                        around they praised the Bodhisattva with the sounds of their tunes: <ref cRef="53" type="sanskrit"/>

                        circled the sublime city of Kapilavastu and then rested by the gates without harming anyone. Five hundred
                        young white elephants arrived, stroking King Śuddhodana’s feet with the tips of their trunks, and then
                        settling down next to him. Divine children, wearing sashes, <ref cRef="77" type="sanskrit"/> were seen moving back and forth between

                        and filling the beings there with happiness.” Finally he took seven steps uphill, lifted his gaze, and

                        will become a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a completely perfect buddha. Yet if he does not renounce the
                        household, he will become a universal monarch, a righteous Dharma king who has conquered the four quarters
                        and is equipped with the seven treasures. The seven treasures that will be his are the precious wheel, the
                        precious elephant, the precious horse, the precious wife, the precious jewel, <ref cRef="F.71.b" type="folio"/> the
                        precious steward, and the precious minister. He will have one thousand sons, all of them full, fierce
                        warriors with well-built bodies that destroy the armies of the enemy. He will conquer the entire earth
                        without the use of violence or weapons, and then he will rule <ref cRef="137" type="sanskrit"/> according to the Dharma. Therefore we
                        must arrange a marriage for the prince. Once he is surrounded by a group of women, he will discover
                        pleasure and not renounce the household. In that way the line of our universal monarchy will not be cut,
                        and we will be irreproachably respected by all the kings of the realm.”</p>

                        surely leave us soon, as these omens foretell.” As a sharp pain shot through his heart, he began to
                        scheme: “My young prince must never even set foot in the palace gardens. He must always remain inside with
                        the maidens so that he will be addicted to their pleasures. He must never leave us!”</p>

                        each of the three seasons—hot, rainy, and cold. <ref cRef="F.95.a" type="folio"/> The Hot Season Palace was very cool,
                        the Rainy Season Palace was both cool and warm, and the Winter Palace was naturally warm. At each palace
                        five hundred guardsmen walked up and down the staircase. While they were ascending and descending the
                        stairs, their calls could be heard for a distance of half a league. Everyone thought, “The young prince
                        will never be able to leave without being noticed.”</p>

                        “The young prince will leave through the Gate of Auspiciousness.” So the king had massive door panels
                        fitted into the Gate of Auspiciousness, so large that it took five hundred men to open and close each of
                        them. The calls of these five hundred men could be heard half a league away. The king provided the palaces
                        with the five desirable things, the likes of which had never been seen before. There were constantly young
                        maidens around the Bodhisattva, playing their instruments, singing songs, and dancing for him.</p>

                    <p tid="1094">On hearing that, King Śuddhodana thought to himself, “My young prince has never been to the

                        surrounded by women. That way he can really enjoy amorous delights and surely he will not leave us

                        celebrate this event during the Hair Festival. At this very place another memorial was built, which today

                    <p tid="1367">Again the Bodhisattva considered, “If I am to be a monk, it would not be right to wear silken
                        garments. So it would be good if I could find some clothes suitable for living in the forest.” <ref cRef="226" type="sanskrit"/>

                    <p tid="1368">The gods of the pure realms then thought, “The Bodhisattva needs saffron-colored robes.”
                        Immediately a god left and manifested in front of the Bodhisattva in the form of a hunter wearing
                        saffron-colored cloth.</p>
                    <p tid="1369">The Bodhisattva asked the god, “My friend, would you give me your saffron-colored robes? Then I
                        will give you my silken garments.”</p>
                    <p tid="1370">The god replied, “Your clothes already suit you well, and I am happy with what I wear.”</p>
                    <p tid="1371">But the Bodhisattva insisted: “Please, I beg you.”</p>

                        Bodhisattva, while he himself took the Bodhisattva’s silken garments. Because the god was overcome with
                        devotion to the Bodhisattva, he touched the garments to his head, holding them with both of his hands.
                        Then he returned to the celestial world in order to render offerings and veneration to the garments there.
                        Chanda had witnessed the exchange of clothes, and later a memorial was erected at the site. This memorial
                        is still known today as the “Memorial of Receiving the Saffron-Colored Cloth.” <ref cRef="F.112.b" type="folio"/>

                        exclaimed,</p>

                        through the Gate of Auspiciousness, the messengers proceeded to this gate. There they saw that a rain of
                        flowers had fallen on the road, and they thought, “He must have left this way.”</p>
                    <p tid="1385">When they had traveled a little farther, they met the god who was carrying the Bodhisattva’s

                        happen is in fact what will happen. And why will the prince not return? Because of his enthusiasm,
                        discipline, and steadfastness.”</p>

                        they were unable to. These ornaments were made for someone with a body as strong as Nārāyaṇa, and so other

                    <p tid="1392">When Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī saw that nobody could move the ornaments, she thought, “When I see

                    <p tid="1470">Monks, since I had now stayed in Vaiśālī for as long as I found enjoyable, I proceeded to the
                        country of Magadha and found my way to Rājagṛha, the capital city of that country. Once there I took up
                        residence at Pāṇḍava, the king of mountains, where I stayed on its slope alone in solitude without any
                        company. At that time many trillions of gods protected me. <ref cRef="240" type="sanskrit"/>
                    </p>
                    <p tid="1471">One morning I dressed in the skirt and robes of a mendicant and, holding my offering bowl, I
                        went into the city of Rājagṛha through the Gate of Warm Water and started my alms round. I looked ahead
                        and to both sides and proceeded in a gracious manner, moving my limbs with elegance. I carried the skirt,
                        the offering bowl, and the monk’s robes in a very beautiful manner. My senses were undistracted and my
                        mind was not diverted by outer events. Like an image of someone who is carrying a vase filled with oil, I
                        looked ahead at a distance of six feet.</p>
                    <p tid="1472">When the people of Rājagṛha saw me, they were amazed and thought, “Goodness, is that Brahmā? Or
                        perhaps Śakra, king of the gods, or Vaiśravaṇa? Or is it some kind of mountain god?”</p>

                    <p tid="1510">Monks, at that time a son of Rāma by the name of Rudraka arrived in Rājagṛha, where he stayed
                        with a large group of seven hundred of his students. He was teaching his students the principles of the
                        disciplined conduct necessary for attaining the state where there is neither perception nor nonperception.
                            <ref cRef="F.120.a" type="folio"/>
                    </p>
                    <p tid="1511">Monks, the Bodhisattva saw that Rudraka, the son of Rāma, was in charge of a group, indeed a
                        large group, and that as the head of the congregation, he was well-known, popular, venerated by the
                        masses, and recognized by all scholars. Witnessing this, the Bodhisattva thought to himself:</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-1197"/>
                    <p tid="1512">“Rudraka, the son of Rāma, is really in charge of a group, indeed a large group; he is the head
                        of the congregation and, moreover, well-known, popular, venerated by the masses, and recognized by all
                        scholars. <ref cRef="244" type="sanskrit"/> However, unless I begin to practice disciplined conduct and austerities myself in his
                        presence, he will never perceive me as someone special. He will also not have an understanding based on
                        direct perception. In this way he will never renounce his concentration, absorption, and states of
                        equilibrium, which are fabricated, defiled, and perpetuating.</p>
                    <p tid="1513">“Therefore I must first actualize these experiences myself. In that way I can demonstrate that
                        his worldly absorptions, which are limited to concentration and which only support states of equilibrium,
                        do not carry a result. I will go to Rudraka, the son of Rāma, and become accepted as his student in order
                        to demonstrate the superiority of the qualities of my own absorption. I will demonstrate to him that
                        fabricated absorptions are pointless.”</p>

                    <p tid="1514">Monks, with this purpose in mind, the Bodhisattva went to see Rudraka, the son of Rāma. When he
                        met Rudraka, the Bodhisattva asked, “My friend, who is your teacher? Who taught you so well?”</p>
                    <p tid="1515">Rudraka, the son of Rāma, answered, “My friend, I did not have a teacher. Nevertheless I did
                        reach a genuine understanding on my own.”</p>
                    <p tid="1516">The Bodhisattva then asked, “What is it you understand?”</p>
                    <p tid="1517">Rudraka replied, “The way of equilibrium, which is neither perception nor nonperception.” <ref cRef="F.120.b" type="folio"/>
                    </p>
                    <p tid="1518">Next the Bodhisattva asked, “Could you please allow me to follow you so that I can obtain the
                        instructions for your path of absorption?”</p>
                    <p tid="1519">Rudraka replied, “Yes indeed, I will let you follow me so that you can obtain instructions for
                        my path of absorption.”</p>

                    <p tid="1520">With this the Bodhisattva went off and sat down with his legs crossed. Now, no sooner did the
                        Bodhisattva sit down before he actualized hundreds of all the main types of worldly and transcendent
                        equilibriums in all their many details. <ref cRef="245" type="sanskrit"/> The reason he could do this was because he had become a
                        master of his mind, possessing a superior accumulation of merit and wisdom, a special fruition of all his
                        previous trainings, and a distinctive familiarity with all absorptions.</p>
                    <p tid="1521">At that point the Bodhisattva arose from his seat, mindful and attentive, and went to see
                        Rudraka, the son of Rāma. He then addressed him: “My friend, is there any higher path than the state of
                        neither perception nor nonperception?”</p>
                    <p tid="1522">“No,” Rudraka replied.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-046-001-1200"/>
                    <p tid="1523">The Bodhisattva then thought to himself, “Rudraka is not the only one who has faith, diligence,
                        mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. I am also faithful, diligent, mindful, concentrated, and wise.” He
                        therefore addressed Rudraka with these words: “My friend, I have now understood the teaching in which you
                        are adept.”</p>
                    <p tid="1524">Rudraka replied, “Well, in that case, come, we should teach everyone together.” And accordingly
                        he installed the Bodhisattva as a teacher on the same level as himself.</p>
                    <p tid="1525">The Bodhisattva then said, “My friend, this path does not free the mind. Neither does it free
                        one from attachment. It also does not lead to cessation or peace. It does not bring higher knowledge, nor
                        does it lead to complete awakening. <ref cRef="F.121.a" type="folio"/> It does not make one a mendicant or a priest,
                        and it does not lead to nirvāṇa.”</p>
                    <p tid="1526">Monks, in this way the Bodhisattva made up his mind regarding Rudraka, the son of Rāma, and his
                        followers. He left them, saying, “This is enough; I am leaving.”</p>

                    <p tid="1527">At that point there were five ascetic companions who were learning religious practices under the
                        guidance of Rudraka, the son of Rāma. They thought to themselves, “Even though we have tried and persisted
                        for a long time in this way, we have not been able to realize our goal. Yet this mendicant Gautama was
                        able to realize it and manifest it through such little hardship. And now he doesn’t want it! Surely he
                        must be searching for something even higher than that. Surely he will become a teacher of the world.
                        Whatever he is about to discover, he will probably share it with us.” And with this, the five ascetic
                        companions left Rudraka, the son of Rāma, to follow the Bodhisattva instead. <ref cRef="246" type="sanskrit"/>

                        he left together with the five ascetic companions in order to wander through the kingdom of Magadha.
                        Somewhere on the road between Rājagṛha and Gaya, they met a group of people who were enjoying a feast.
                        This group called out to the Bodhisattva and the five ascetic companions and invited them to sit down and
                        participate in the feast.</p>
                    <p tid="1529">Monks, afterward the Bodhisattva proceeded through Magadha and eventually arrived at Gaya. At
                        the peak of Mount Gaya, the Bodhisattva stayed in order to apply himself to strenuous practice. As he was
                        staying there, three parables that he had never previously heard or thought of came to his mind. What were
                        these three?</p>

                    <p tid="1530">First he thought, “There are some monks and priests who are unable to separate their mind and

                        are burned by them. This striving after the objects of desire never brings peace. They further harm
                        themselves and torment their bodies and end up with intense and unbearable feelings of suffering.
                        Therefore, in doing so, they become incapable of actualizing the noble wisdom vision that is superior to
                        any human teaching. This is like a person who tries in vain to create a fire in order to make light by

                        superior to any human teaching.” This was the first example that he had never thought or heard of that
                        came to the Bodhisattva’s mind.</p>

                    <p tid="1531">Second, he continued to think, “There are also monks and priests who have separated their mind
                        and body from the objects of their desire. Still they delight in those objects and feel attached to them,

                        They further harm themselves and torment their bodies and end up with intense and unbearable feelings of

                        and end up with intense and unbearable feelings of suffering, as if being burned. Therefore, in doing so,
                        they become incapable of actualizing the noble wisdom vision that is much supreme to the highest human

                        practices. The reason for calling this <distinct>difficult practice</distinct> is because it is
                        excruciatingly difficult, and therefore it is described in such terms. Except for a bodhisattva who has
                        reached his last existence and rests in equanimity in all-pervasive absorption, there is no one, human or
                        nonhuman, who is capable of undergoing such hardships. This absorption is called
                            <distinct>all-pervasive</distinct> because as the Bodhisattva rested in equanimity in the fourth
                        absorption, from the very beginning all movements of the breath slowed down and ceased, and the absorption
                        was nonconceptual. There was no thought, no movement, no conceptual mind, and no change, yet it was
                        all-pervading and not dependent on anything. Previously no student, master, solitary buddha, or
                        bodhisattva who had taken up such conduct had ever entered this absorption. This absorption is likened to
                        space, because like space—which is motionless, uncaused, and changeless—there is nowhere it cannot reach.
                        In that way it is similar to space, and therefore it is described as such.</p>

                        under the shade of a rose apple tree, I rejoiced as I attained the first level of concentration, which is
                        free from desires and negativities, endued with good qualities, reflective, investigative, and full of joy
                        born out of discrimination. I rejoiced as I attained the levels of concentration up to the fourth. That,

                        lead to awakening. Therefore I shall begin to eat solid food again. That way I can regain my physical

                        pores of your body.”</p>
                    <p tid="1642">Monks, I then thought, “I took a vow to remain fasting. And in this way the people in the

                        hypocrisy. Instead he decided to begin eating solid foods. Monks, in this way the Bodhisattva arose from
                        the seat where he had practiced discipline and hardship for the past six years, <ref cRef="F.130.b" type="folio"/> and
                        he proclaimed, “I will now eat solid foods, such as molasses, pea soup, lentil soup, porridge, and

                        of Making Use of Others’ Emanations, and finally all the way to the Brahma realm. Monks, at that time, at

                    <p tid="1655">Afterward the Bodhisattva felt tired and wanted to step out of the pond. However, Māra, the evil
                        one, felt jealous and magically raised the edge of the pond. Yet at the side of the pond was a large
                        kakubha tree. In order to follow the worldly custom and to please the goddess of that tree, the
                        Bodhisattva called out to her, “Listen, goddess, lower one of your branches!” The goddess lowered a branch
                        and, as the Bodhisattva grasped it, he was lifted out of the pond. Once he was free, he remained under the
                        shade of the kakubha tree, where he sewed the dusty rag into the robes of a monk. Today this place is
                        still known as “The Sewing of the Dusty Rags.”</p>
                    <p tid="1656">At that point a god from the pure realms, who was called Vimalaprabha, offered the Bodhisattva
                        divine fabrics that had been dyed in saffron-red color, as is suitable for a monk. The Bodhisattva
                        accepted this gift, and the following morning he put on these fabrics, arranged them into a monk’s robes,
                        and went to the nearby village.</p>

                        village Senāpati in Urubilvā: “The one for whom you have been making offerings has relaxed his discipline
                        and decided that he will once again eat nourishing and solid food. Previously you made the aspiration,
                        ‘May the Bodhisattva take my food and thereby truly attain perfect and completely unexcelled awakening!’
                        Now that time has come, so you must do what you ought to be doing.” <ref cRef="F.132.a" type="folio"/>

                    <p tid="1658">Monks, as soon as Sujātā, daughter of the villager Nandika, heard these words of the gods, she
                        quickly gathered the milk of a thousand cows. Seven times she skimmed the cream from the milk, until she
                        obtained a thick, strength-giving cream. She then poured this cream into a new clay pot, mixed it with the
                        freshest rice, and placed it on a brand-new stove. As the milk porridge was cooking, various omens
                        manifested. <ref cRef="268" type="sanskrit"/> Within the milk appeared the contours of an endless knot, a simple swastika, an
                        elaborate swastika, a lotus, a vardhamāna, and other auspicious signs. Upon seeing this, Sujātā thought to
                        herself, “The appearance of these signs surely means that the Bodhisattva will now take food and obtain
                        unexcelled, perfect, and complete awakening.” At that time a fortuneteller versed in ritual and the art of
                        reading signs came to the village and prophesied that someone would attain immortality there.</p>

                    <p tid="1659">When Sujātā had finished cooking the porridge, she placed it on the ground where, full of
                        devotion, she had already prepared a seat for the Bodhisattva by scattering flowers and perfumed water.
                        She then told one of her servants, a woman named Uttarā, “Uttarā, go and fetch the priest. I will stay
                        here and look after this milk porridge with honey.”</p>
                    <p tid="1660">“Very well, my lady,” answered Uttarā, who then did as she was told. She went off in the eastern
                        direction, but there she met only the Bodhisattva. She then went south, but there as well she met the
                        Bodhisattva. Then she went west and north, but in those places as well she encountered the Bodhisattva. At
                        that time some gods from the pure realms had removed all the extremist practitioners, and now none of them
                        were to be found.</p>

                    <p tid="1662">Sujātā said, “He alone is the monk, he alone is the priest! It is for his sake that I have

                    <p tid="1663">“Very well, my lady,” said Uttarā, and off she went. When she met the Bodhisattva, she bowed at
                        his feet and conveyed Sujātā’s invitation to him. <ref cRef="F.132.b" type="folio"/>

                        the seat that had been prepared for him. Monks, the village girl Sujātā then filled a golden vessel with

                        had his meal. When he was done, he got up and asked Sujātā, “Sister, what should I do with the golden

                    <p tid="1666">“Please take it with you,” she replied.</p>
                    <p tid="1667">The Bodhisattva told her, “I don’t need this bowl.”</p>
                    <p tid="1668">Sujātā then told him, “Well then, do as you please. But I do not give food to anyone without

                        Nairañjanā River, the river of nāgas. He put down his bowl and rope and entered the water to refresh
                        himself. Monks, while the Bodhisattva was bathing, several hundred thousand gods came to venerate him.
                        They poured divine aloe and sandalwood powder as well as various ointments into the river, and they
                        scattered divine flowers of all colors onto the water. In this way the whole great Nairañjanā River flowed
                        on full of divine perfumes and flowers that rained down. Many trillion gods came to collect the perfumed
                        water that the Bodhisattva had used for bathing. They brought it with them to their own abodes in order to
                        enshrine it in memorials and venerate it. The village girl Sujātā also collected all the hair and the
                        beard of the Bodhisattva. Thinking that it must be sacred, <ref cRef="F.133.a" type="folio"/> she took it with her in

                        suitable place on the riverbank. Right then, a nāga girl who lived in the Nairañjanā River emerged out of
                        the earth’s surface and offered the Bodhisattva a throne made of jewels.</p>

                        Sujātā, he drank what he needed of the milk porridge made with honey. When he was done with his meal, he
                        threw the golden bowl into the water without any feelings of attachment. As soon as the bowl hit the
                        water, the nāga king Sāgara, full of devotion and great respect, came to fetch the bowl and bring it to
                        his kingdom, thinking, “This is worthy of veneration!”</p>

                        In this heaven he started a religious festival called The Procession of the Bowl, observed on the days of

                        tree to give it perfect roots, trunk, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits, as well as a perfect height
                        and circumference. It was beautiful, nice to behold, wide, and, with its height of eighty palm trees and a
                        corresponding circumference, very imposing. This was indeed a magnificent and beautiful tree. It was
                        encircled by jewel platforms that were built in seven rows. Jewel palm trees were also placed around it in
                        seven circles, and a sevenfold lattice with bells of precious stones enfolded it. All of this was
                        surrounded with seven threads made of precious materials that formed the outer ring.</p>
                    <p tid="1709">Like the coral tree or the kovidāra tree, this was a tree that one could never tire of
                        beholding. This place, where the Bodhisattva was to take his seat with the intention of attaining full and
                        complete awakening, had become the essence of indestructible diamond, harder than any diamond in the great
                        trichiliocosm.</p>

                    <p tid="1710">Monks, as the Bodhisattva was walking toward the seat of awakening, rays of light streamed forth
                        from his body. The light pacified all the lower realms and caused all unfortunate states to cease. All the
                        painful feelings of beings in the lower realms came to a halt. <ref cRef="F.138.a" type="folio"/> <ref cRef="279" type="sanskrit"/> All beings with
                        impaired faculties now recovered their senses. Anyone who suffered from disease was healed. Anyone feeling
                        discomfort attained happiness. All who were struck with fear found release. Anyone living in bondage was
                        freed from his or her ties. Anyone suffering from poverty discovered wealth. All the people tormented by
                        disturbing emotions found release from their anguish. Those who were starving had their stomachs filled.
                        All the ones who were parched were relieved of their thirst. Pregnant women gave birth easily. Those who
                        were old and weak gained perfect strength.</p>
                    <p tid="1711">At that moment all sentient beings were relieved of the harms inflicted by attachment, anger,
                        ignorance, wrath, greed, cruelty, ill will, envy, and jealousy. At that moment no one experienced dying,
                        moving to the next life, and taking birth. At that moment everyone engendered love, altruism, and a
                        feeling that all beings are each other’s mothers and fathers.</p>

                        displays at the seat of awakening. The Bodhisattva himself, however, caused all the displays that

                        supreme lord who holds sway over the desire realm, the most powerful and evil demon. <ref cRef="F.147.b" type="folio"/>

                        will now arouse that evil Māra. Once I have conquered him, all the gods in the desire realm will also be
                        restrained. Moreover, there are some gods in Māra’s retinue who have previously created some basic
                        goodness. When they witness my lion-like display, they will direct their minds toward unsurpassed and
                        complete awakening.”</p>

                        triumphed in the face of battle, and raised high the parasols, standards, and banners of conquest, he
                        settled into the first meditative concentration. That state is free from desires, free of factors
                        connected with evil deeds and nonvirtues, accompanied by thought and analysis, and imbued with the joy and
                        pleasure born of discernment.</p>
                    <p tid="2150">When he had brought about the cessation of thought and analysis, he became perfectly quiet in
                        and of himself, and therefore his mind became concentrated. Through this he settled into the second
                        meditative concentration, which is free of thought and analysis and is imbued with the joy and pleasure
                        born of meditative absorption.</p>

                        which is unconnected with joy. The noble ones call such a person <ref cRef="344" type="sanskrit"/> <distinct>the impartial one

                        past, both mental pleasure and displeasure vanished. Thus he settled into the fourth meditative
                        concentration, which is perfectly pristine impartiality and mindfulness, unconnected with pleasure or
                        pain.</p>

                        he had crossed the four rivers. He was of royal caste since he upheld the single jewel parasol, a priest
                        of the three worlds since he had abandoned evil actions, a mendicant since he has cracked open the
                        eggshell of ignorance, an ascetic since he had perfectly transcended all attachment, a gentleman since he
                        had eradicated afflictions, a hero since he did not let the banner fall, a powerhouse since he was endowed
                        with the ten powers, a jewel mine since he was replete with all the gems of the Dharma.</p>

                        two learned and clever merchant brothers from the north, Trapuṣa and Bhallika, were traveling back from
                        the south, after having gained much profit, with a caravan of five hundred fully loaded carts carrying
                        many kinds of merchandise.</p>
                    <p tid="2430">They had two bullocks called Sujāta and Kīrti. These two bulls had no fear of being waylaid, and
                        thus they could be employed where no other bullocks would pass. Wherever there was a threat, they would
                        stand as though fastened to stakes. <ref cRef="F.182.b" type="folio"/> They could not be goaded by a whip, but only by
                        handfuls of lotus flowers, or garlands of jasmine flowers.</p>
                    <p tid="2431">When this caravan of merchants approached the Bodhi tree, a goddess who lived in a forest of
                        milk trees enchanted all the carriages, thus rendering them motionless. All the parts of the carriages,
                        such as the harnesses and the rest, tore and split, and the wheels of the carriages sunk into the ground
                        up to their axles. Even with everyone making great effort, the carts would move no farther.</p>

                    <p tid="2433">They brought out the two bullocks Sujāta and Kīrti, but they also would move no farther, even
                        though they were goaded with bunches of lotuses and garlands of jasmine. So the merchants thought, “Since
                        even these two animals will not move, there certainly must be some threat up ahead.”</p>
                    <p tid="2434">Thus they dispatched scouts on horseback. When the scouts returned, they reported, “There is no
                        threat whatsoever.”</p>
                    <p tid="2435">The goddess then revealed her form and consoled the members of the caravan, saying, “Do not

                        they saw the Thus-Gone One blazing like the god of fire, well adorned with the thirty-two marks of a great
                        being, shining with splendor, like the sun just after dawn.</p>
                    <p tid="2437">Seeing him, the merchants were amazed and thought, “Is this Brahmā who has come here? Or is it
                        Śakra, lord of the gods? Or is it Vaiśravaṇa, or perhaps the sun or the moon? Or is it some mountain god,

                        they requested the Thus-Gone One, “Please regard us with compassion and accept these alms!”</p>
                    <p tid="2441">Monks, the Thus-Gone One then wondered, “It would not be appropriate for me to take these alms
                        with my hands. What vessel did the previous perfect and complete awakened ones use to accept alms?” Right
                        then the answer dawned on him.</p>

                    <p tid="2443">Thinking, however, that those bowls were not appropriate for a monk, the Thus-Gone One did not

                        four made of quartz, four made of coral, four made of emerald, and four made of every gem. They offered
                        them to the Thus-Gone One, but he declined, thinking that these were all inappropriate for a monk.</p>

                        intellect. Only wise noble ones and adepts can understand it. It is the complete and definitive
                        apprehension of the abandonment of all aggregates, the end of all sensations, the absolute truth, and
                        freedom from a foundation. It is a state of complete peace, free of clinging, free of grasping,
                        unobserved, undemonstrable, uncompounded, beyond the six sense fields, inconceivable, unimaginable, and
                        ineffable. It is indescribable, inexpressible, and incapable of being illustrated. It is unobstructed,
                        beyond all references, a state of interruption through the path of tranquility, and imperceptible like
                        emptiness. It is the exhaustion of craving and it is cessation free of desire. It is nirvāṇa. If I were to
                        teach this truth to others, they would not understand it. Teaching the truth would tire me out and be
                        wrongly contested, and it would be futile. Thus I will remain silent and keep this truth in my heart.”</p>
