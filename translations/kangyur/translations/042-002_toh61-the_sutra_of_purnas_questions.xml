                    about the conduct of bodhisattvas practicing on the path to awakening. The
                    Buddha replies by describing the attitudes that bodhisattvas must possess as
                    well as their benefits. Then, at the request of Maudgalyāyana, the Buddha
                    recounts several of his past lives in which he himself practiced bodhisattva
                    conduct. At the end of the teaching, the Buddha instructs the assembly in
                    dealing with specific objections to his teachings that outsiders might raise
                    after he himself has passed into nirvāṇa.</p>

                        little attention in modern scholarship.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-042-002-5" index="2">In his article on the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vyākhyāyukti</title>, Peter Verhagen cites
                            Vasubandhu to the effect that a “<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Pūrṇasūtra</title>” was lost or at least incompletely transmitted
                            by his time (Verhagen 2005, 590). Peter Skilling lists the <title xml:lang="en">Questions of Pūrṇa</title> in a series of discourses
                            mentioning <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tathāgata
                                caityas</foreign> (Skilling 2016, p.31). Ulrich Pagel mentions the
                            sūtra in a few lists in two articles, once in a list of texts that
                            include mention of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhāraṇī</foreign> (Pagel 2007, 164, 167) and another time in a list
                            of texts that give a sixfold typology of “skill” (Pagel 2012,
                            337).</note> Only a few of the texts contained in the <title xml:lang="en">Heap of Jewels</title> are extant in Sanskrit, and the
                            <title xml:lang="en">Questions of Pūrṇa</title> is unfortunately not
                        among them. There is only one Chinese translation (T. 310–17), produced by
                        the renowned translator Kumārajīva, (334–413 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>)
                        who completed the translation toward the end of his life in 405 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, while residing in the then Chinese capital of
                        Chang’an. The Tibetan translation was completed in the early translation
                        period and is listed in both early ninth-century catalogs, the Denkarma
                        (Tib. <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan dkar ma</title>) and the Phangthangma
                        (Tib. <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’phang thang ma</title>). We have rendered it
                        here into English based on the Degé block print, the Comparative Edition
                        (Tib. <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe bsdur ma</title>), and the Stok Palace
                        manuscript, comparing these line by line with Kumārajīva’s Chinese
                        translation.</p>

                    <p tid="4">Unlike most of the discourses translated during the early translation
                        period, evidence suggests that this text was most likely translated from
                        Chinese, rather than from Sanskrit: Kumārajīva’s translation and the Tibetan
                        are nearly identical in content and structure,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-042-002-7" index="3">The few minor differences between
                            them can be easily explained by the separate transmission histories of
                            each text. Less likely, the similarity could theoretically also be due
                            to both translations having relied on a nearly identical Sanskrit source
                            text.</note> and a number of textual problems with the Tibetan can be
                        clearly ascertained to be transmissional corruptions only when comparing
                        them with the Chinese. Moreover, the Tibetan includes several transliterated
                        proper names and other terms that seem to derive from the Chinese; and a few
                            terms<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-042-002-8" index="4"> For

                        standard colophon that usually follows Tibetan translations is missing in
                        this text.</p>

                    <p tid="5">The eponymous primary interlocutor in the sūtra, who first sets the
                        scene by asking questions related to bodhisattva conduct, is the monk Pūrṇa
                        Maitrāyaṇīputra. Pūrṇa is a well-known character in the Buddhist discourses;
                        he is described as the foremost in explaining the doctrine. He is also
                        regarded as one of the ten main disciples of the Buddha, especially noted
                        for his eloquence. Following Pūrṇa’s inquiry, the sūtra unfolds in eight
                        chapters that address a variety of topics related to bodhisattva conduct.
                        Throughout the text, great emphasis is placed on the importance of realizing
                        the nature of emptiness and the view that does not dwell on any
                        phenomenon.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-042-002-10"/>
                    <p tid="6">Chapter 1 presents a teaching by the Buddha on the way that
                        bodhisattvas can accomplish immeasurable awakened qualities after giving
                        rise to the mind set on awakening. The Buddha lists several sets of
                        spiritual qualities that bodhisattvas must accomplish in order to reach the
                        awakened state. Chapter 2 is devoted to the question of developing a high
                        level of erudition, which allows bodhisattvas to comprehend the definitive
                        meaning of the Dharma. Chapter 3 describes how bodhisattvas can avoid
                        regressing from awakening by studying, contemplating, and practicing
                        previously unknown Dharma teachings with an open mind, rather than
                        automatically discarding them as non-Dharma. Chapter 4 presents further sets
                        of spiritual qualities that bodhisattvas must cultivate in order to obtain
                        sufficient roots of virtue. Here the Buddha also narrates a story from one
                        of his previous lives as inspiration for practice.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-042-002-11"/>
                    <p tid="7">Chapter 5 presents the Buddha displaying his miraculous powers to the
                        assembly by projecting light from his body. All those who witness this
                        miraculous display become attracted to the Dharma and aspire to achieve
                        perfect awakening. Chapter 6 begins with Mahāmaudgalyāyana, another of the
                        Buddha’s closest disciples, requesting a teaching on the Buddha’s practice
                        of bodhisattva conduct in the past. On this occasion, the Buddha recounts
                        several stories from his past lives, describing in detail the hardships he
                        had to undergo for the sake of beings. Chapter 7 introduces advice by the
                        Buddha on how to deal with particular controversies the monks might be faced
                        with after he has passed away. Using various arguments to counter the
                        accusations of future adversaries, the Buddha explains how to respond to
                        such controversies. This entire chapter is devoted to the defense of the
                        thought and practice of the Great Vehicle against the objections of orthodox
                        Buddhists, who argued that such newly emerging texts were not authentic
                        Buddhist scriptures. This indicates that a prescription to adopt the
                        Bodhisattva Vehicle had not yet been widely accepted. Lastly, in chapter 8
                        Pūrṇa praises the Buddha’s teaching and makes a commitment to follow the
                        path of the Great Vehicle himself, in order to liberate all beings from
                        suffering.</p>

                        arose, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. With
                        his palms joined together in the direction of the Blessed One he said,
                        “Blessed One, I have a few questions to ask you. Thus-Gone One, please

                            <ref cRef="F.173.a" type="folio"/> Why is it so? Because, Pūrṇa, dwelling on marks
                        generates attachment, anger, and ignorance. Dwelling on the marks of

                        ignorance. Therefore, Pūrṇa, all those views that involve clinging to marks
                        are known as <distinct>wrong views</distinct>. Bodhisattvas cultivate love
                        in order to pacify all those marks. They think, ‘Since sentient beings and
                        marks will perish, entities will also perish. Since entities will perish,
                        views will also perish.’ In this way, bodhisattvas then cultivate love as
                        everything perishes. This love is known as <distinct>love free from

                        by the words <distinct>love of the Buddha</distinct>. Furthermore, Pūrṇa,
                        the complete realization of all phenomena as they really are is also what is

                        the Dharma.’ Why is it so? Because, Pūrṇa, if someone says, ‘the Dharma
                        exists,’ that would be non-Dharma, <ref cRef="F.173.b" type="folio"/> and if he says ‘the

                    <p tid="120">“At that time, there was a Dharma-preaching monk called
                        Mahāsthāmaprāpta. The Dharma preacher Mahāsthāmaprāpta had developed great
                        powers and his erudition was vast. He was an excellent Dharma <term type="ignore">teacher</term>, he was eloquent, and he had clearly
                        realized the meaning of the Dharma. Through the miraculous power of the

                        Dharma teachings in order to protect the sublime Dharma within the world.
                        While he was spreading the Dharma, most beings would deprecate and oppose
                        him. As a result, the Dharma-preaching monk Mahāsthāmaprāpta thought, ‘When
                        such beings hear these Dharma teachings that they have never heard before,
                        they do not believe in them, so they also show no interest in listening to
                        them or adopting them. Even when they hear these teachings, they do not
                        comprehend their meaning, and therefore they do not follow them. Instead,
                        they oppose and deprecate these teachings. Many monks say, “These are not
                        the words of the Buddha; these are not the teachings of the Great <term type="ignore">Teacher</term>! Why is it so? Because we have never before
                        heard such discourses from any teacher or preceptor. Furthermore, no elder

                        transmission from any teacher or preceptor.” Therefore, since no other
                        teachings now remain besides those of the discourses and those of the
                        aphorisms, should I perhaps leave for a solitary place and remain there
                        alone?’</p>

                        entertain any doubts. Compared to all the doubts and questions expressed by
                        all those sentient beings for an eon or even longer, the answers related to
                        a single Dharma teaching that I heard from the Thus-Gone One were much more
                        numerous. The same logic applies with respect to two, three, four, five,
                        ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand,
                        or a hundred thousand Dharma teachings. Monk, if I were to explain this in

                        infinite, and inconceivable. Nevertheless, I recited and embraced all of
                        them. Monk, still, I clearly understand that all those questions are
                        contained within a single Dharma teaching. This consists of <ref cRef="F.178.b" type="folio"/> the words of the path, the words of the gateways, the
                        words of the seals, the fundamental words, the vajra-like words, the
                        important words, the unshakable words, and the unfathomable words spoken by
                        the thus-gone one King of All Qualities’ Light Rays. Monk, all the Dharma
                        teachings are included within a single gateway. Since it is a pure gateway
                        beyond formations, it acts as the basis for all the Dharma teachings and all
                        their words. Therefore, everything will be accessed through that gateway.
                        All the discourses and aphorisms, moreover, are accessed through that
                        gateway, just as a single syllable, by being grammatically inflected, can
                        form many different words. Monk, similarly, this teaching accesses all the
                        seventy-eight thousand gateways of the dhāraṇīs. In this regard, there are
                        also ninety-two thousand different types of faculties. From the perspective
                        of the conduct of sentient beings there are also eighty thousand types of

                        emptiness, which is utterly free from conceptual marks and in harmony with

                        bodhisattvas hear the profound discourses that conform with the profound
                        ultimate meaning, they will not develop even the slightest sign of trust in

                        understanding of them. If these bodhisattvas then commit wrongdoings that
                        undermine the authentic Dharma, this will create the causes and conditions
                        for them to be reborn within the unfree states. As a consequence, they will
                        not encounter any buddhas, they will not hear the sublime Dharma, they will
                        not receive instructions from the buddhas, and they will not meet virtuous
                        friends. Because these bodhisattvas will not meet any buddhas, they will not
                        hear the authentic Dharma and will therefore not receive instructions from

                        they will not meet virtuous friends and will therefore be disconnected from
                        the free states and instead will take rebirth within the unfree states.
                        Because these bodhisattvas will be reborn within the unfree states, they
                        will not connect with virtuous friends but instead will encounter
                        nonvirtuous friends. By following those nonvirtuous friends, they will

                        thereby abandoning the mind set on awakening. By abandoning the vehicle of

                        the mind directed toward awakening, they will exclusively engage in saṃsāric
                        affairs, and will not accomplish the Dharma related to the conduct of the
                        Great Vehicle. Pūrṇa, if bodhisattvas adopt this third attitude, they will
                        become followers of the Hearers’ Vehicle after having turned away from
                        unsurpassed awakening.</p>

                        discourses, some of them may fail to teach them altruistically to others.
                        Instead they are timid, prefer their own company, or feel miserliness
                        regarding the Dharma, without a wish to teach others. Consequently, they do
                        not attract other beings on a vast scale through the Dharma. Such
                        bodhisattvas will, through the causes and conditions of these nonvirtuous

                        to the deterioration of their insight and recollection, they will not read
                        or recite those discourses with others, and they will not be in harmony with
                        others through the Dharma. As a consequence, as soon as they take on new

                        they do so with the intention of protecting sentient beings. Therefore, when
                        they perceive the physical or mental suffering of sentient beings, they
                        think, ‘Through persistent diligence, I will liberate these beings from
                        their saṃsāric sufferings and bring them happiness. Through my guidance, I
                        will free them from their sufferings in saṃsāra!’ Having given rise to such
                        an attitude, they then diligently train in the six perfections—the
                        perfections of generosity, discipline, patience, diligence, concentration,
                        and insight. Pūrṇa, bodhisattvas gain mastery over the six perfections
                        through the perfection of insight. What is the perfection of insight of
                        bodhisattvas? How do they develop persistent diligence through the
                        perfection of insight?</p>

                        When they reflect and investigate in that way, they realize, ‘I cannot find
                        any phenomenon that could be called <distinct>I</distinct> or
                            <distinct>mine</distinct>.’ In this way they conclude that there is

                        beings who are genuinely following the Great Vehicle constantly rely on and
                        familiarize themselves with four qualities, they will gather all virtues in

                    <p tid="247">“Pūrṇa, (1) the noble sons and daughters who have given rise to the
                        mind set on awakening within the Great Vehicle should rely on and cultivate
                        the practice of patience. If their minds are in a state of equanimity when
                        they cultivate patience, they will attain the perfection of equality, as
                        well as the perfection of sameness toward all beings. When such bodhisattvas
                        are endowed with the perfection of sameness and the perfection of the wisdom
                        of sameness—whether they are walking, standing, sitting, lying down,
                        sleeping, or awake—if someone comes along carrying a vase filled with urine,
                        poison, hot liquid, garbage, fire, ashes, excrement, or embers and pours the
                        content of the vase on their heads, or strikes their limbs with full force,
                        these bodhisattvas should avoid becoming angry or resentful, thus becoming
                        distracted and aggressive. They should not even ask, ‘What did I do wrong?’
                        They should also not regard the other person with hostility. Instead, they
                        should tame their minds by one-pointedly pursuing their Dharma practice,
                        without losing a clear focus on the aim of their practice. Such bodhisattvas
                        will think, ‘When that person comes to me carrying a vase filled with urine,
                        poison, ashes, or embers and tries to harm my body, my body is not hurt or
                        injured by those substances.’ <ref cRef="F.191.b" type="folio"/> Thus analyzing things in
                        terms of their multiple causes and conditions, bodhisattvas will then
                        contemplate this matter in accordance with the way things really are, asking
                        themselves, ‘Who is pouring these substances on me?’ ‘On whom are these
                        substances poured?’ ‘What are the substances poured?’ At that time, they
                        will not find anyone who is the pourer, anyone who is the recipient of this
                        act, or anything that is poured. Contemplating and investigating in this way
                        with proper mindfulness, they will not find any of these things, and they
                        will therefore not apprehend or behold any phenomenon. Because they do not
                        apprehend or behold any phenomenon, they will also not give rise to anger or
                        resentment.</p>

                    <p tid="248">“Pūrṇa, despite the fact that they reflect in that way, if anger
                        and resentment nonetheless arise in the minds of these bodhisattvas, they
                        should think in this way, with genuine mindfulness: ‘Through the causes and
                        conditions of what tactile objects is my body hurt? Where did those tactile
                        objects touch me? Did they harm my body or did they harm my mind? If it is
                        the case that they have harmed my body, since my body is like grass, like a
                        log, like gravel, like a stone, or like an image, it is devoid of concepts
                        and consciousness, and it is neither self nor other. If it is the case that
                        they have harmed my mind, since my mind has neither color nor shape, since
                        it arises and ceases every moment, and since it does not remain the same for
                        a single instant, it is also neither self nor other. Moreover, since it is
                        always false conceptual imputations that express statements such as, ‘this
                        is suffering,’ ‘this is happiness,’ and ‘this is neither suffering nor
                        happiness,’ I will no longer give rise to such false conceptual imputations.
                        Instead, I will now perceive reality from the perspective of the genuine
                        characteristic of sameness and perform the activities of noble beings. I
                        will not engage in the activities of immature ordinary beings. What are the
                        activities of noble beings? Keeping a distance from and being liberated from
                        phenomena. <ref cRef="F.192.a" type="folio"/> However, if I train in staying away from
                        and avoiding phenomena, this will in fact connect me to all those false
                        concepts. To what will this approach connect me? It will connect me to
                        desire, anger, and ignorance. How will this connect me to desire, anger, and
                        ignorance? When someone experiences physical pain, due to the delusion
                        related to the body and to the view of the transitory collection, and due to
                        a strong clinging to this view of the transitory collection, this person
                        will become hostile to others. This is known as <distinct>connecting with
                            anger</distinct>. Because of the delusion associated with the view of
                        the transitory collection, and because of strongly clinging to this view
                        combined with the experience of unpleasant circumstances, this person will
                        become hostile to others. This is known as <distinct>connecting with
                            ignorance</distinct>. Those who are bound by these three poisons and
                        create the causes and conditions for such wrongdoing will not be protected
                        by the thus-gone ones, so surely not by anyone else either. Hence you should
                        think, ‘I will now investigate properly these causal and circumstantial
                        phenomena and view them as being emptiness.’</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-042-002-255"/>
                    <p tid="249">“When bodhisattvas investigate such phenomena in terms of their
                        causes and conditions, by viewing them appropriately in this way, they will
                        also not find anyone who gives, anyone who receives, or anything that is
                        given. At that time, these bodhisattvas should think, ‘Since all phenomena
                        arise from a variety of causes and conditions, they are naturally empty from
                        the very beginning. So if they are empty and without any objective status
                        whatsoever, why would I create karmic actions in relation to such untrue
                        phenomena that cannot be apprehended? Why would I in this way create the
                        causes and conditions for further formations by giving rise to anger?
                        Without any anger or resentment, <ref cRef="F.192.b" type="folio"/> I must instead
                        realize that phenomena are unconditioned, nonarising, and unborn, and view
                        them as having the nature of emptiness. I will not follow after my mind, but
                        instead, from now on, behold unconditioned, nonarising, and unborn
                        phenomena, without dwelling on conditioned and manifest phenomena. I will
                        contemplate phenomena as they really are, and from now on I will ardently
                        avoid perceiving that which is inauthentic and nonexistent as being a
                        phenomenon. Anger and resentment consistently form what is inauthentic. Why
                        is it so? Because anger and resentment are present whenever one perceives an
                        essence of phenomena. However, within emptiness—the ultimately true
                        characteristic of phenomena—there is primordially no essence of phenomena to
                        dwell upon.’ When bodhisattvas contemplate phenomena in this way, their
                        minds become completely disengaged, and anger and resentment will no longer
                        arise in them.</p>

                        toward such people. Realizing the sameness of all phenomena, they should
                        think, ‘I will not become angry at sentient beings or become attached to
                        them. Why not? Because both attachment and aversion are disturbing emotions.
                        Therefore, I will now properly realize the actual nature of phenomena,
                        without craving them. Why? Because, among all the disturbing emotions, those
                        connected to craving are the heaviest of all. This disturbing emotion
                        penetrates even to the bone and marrow, for among the things that can bind
                        beings, craving is what causes clinging. Why is it so? Because if we are
                        attached to something and our wishes are not fulfilled, we will also become
                        angry. Since beings are attached to their bodies, if someone harms them,
                        they become angry. Therefore, one should know that anger is a karmic
                        ripening that results from craving, while clinging is a karmic ripening that
                        results from ignorance. I will now discard this mind that is sullied by
                        craving and stop clinging to phenomena. I will no longer perpetuate the
                        manifestation of desire, anger, or ignorance. I will instead train
                        intensively in realizing the suchness of phenomena, <ref cRef="F.193.b" type="folio"/>
                        thereby viewing the characteristics of phenomena as they really are. In
                        accordance with the teachings, I will act properly and thus rely on the
                        causes and conditions that lead to karmic ripening. Knowing that the
                        circumstances of both veneration and hardship are conditioned by previous
                        actions, I will delight in conducive factors and never give rise to craving.
                        I will purify my mind without ever giving rise to anger, even toward those
                        beings who oppose virtue. I will eliminate ill-will from my mind and never
                        follow desire, anger, or ignorance, or engage in negative actions.’ Pūrṇa,
                        bodhisattvas who possess this first quality will achieve all excellent
                        qualities.” At that moment, the Blessed One uttered these <term type="ignore">verses</term> to explain this clearly:</p>

                        many trillions of light rays radiated from the pores of his skin. Masses of
                        blazing fire as huge as Mount Sumeru also emerged from each of his pores;
                        and thus-gone ones teaching the Dharma, as numerous as all the grains of
                        sand in the Ganges river, also emerged from each pore. The entire assembly
                        present witnessed these miraculous displays. After the Blessed One had
                        manifested them, he asked the venerable Pūrṇa, “Pūrṇa, did you see the power
                        of the miraculous displays coming from the pore of each body hair of the
                        Thus-Gone One?”</p>

                    <p tid="403">“Pūrṇa,” continued the Blessed One, “the Thus-Gone One always
                        possesses, in an uninterrupted manner, the power of such miraculous
                        displays. Nevertheless, the hearers perceive only the Thus-Gone One sitting
                        here and explaining the Dharma. But right now, he genuinely performs the
                        deeds of a buddha in an uninterrupted manner, within all the universes of
                        the ten directions, as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges river.
                        Similarly, he teaches the Dharma within all the universes of the ten
                        directions. Pūrṇa, someone may suitably ask, ‘Who is that peerless and
                        matchless being, that supreme human, that extremely profound and boundless
                        field of merit, whose conduct is so boundless? Even as he merely takes a
                        single step, no other being is able to comprehend the motivation and conduct
                        involved in the act of lifting his foot and placing it down.’ If someone
                        were to ask that question, I would have to answer, ‘That person is I.’
                        Pūrṇa, no sentient being is able to assess the intent, consideration, or
                        conduct involved in the Thus-Gone One’s act of lifting and setting down a
                        single foot.”</p>

                        the bodhisattva collection remains within the world, <ref cRef="F.206.a" type="folio"/>
                        the entire Dharma of the Buddha will also remain. Ānanda, if such a profound

                        they are taught would also vanish. Because the Dharma teachings that must be

                        would also vanish. Ānanda, you should now worship me with the most sublime

                        worship, venerate, and revere the Dharma, but they do not hold worldly

                        had disappeared. At that moment, the king became utterly delighted and
                        thought, ‘If a buddha appears in the <term type="ignore">world</term> and
                        comes to my country, may I meet him face to face. Upon meeting him, may I
                        develop sincere trust in him. Having developed sincere trust, may I worship
                        him. I will offer this forest to that thus-gone one. May he reside in this
                        place, and may I hear the Dharma from him. Why? Because this forest is a
                        place for those who are to be worshiped, not for those who are bound by the
                        five sense desires.’</p>

                        example of a rich, wealthy, and affluent householder surrounded by male and
                        female servants, as well as other staff. After performing hundreds of
                        rituals, he becomes the father of a son. His son is very dear to him, so he
                        never tires of looking at his son. Maudgalyāyana, that householder always
                        looks after the best circumstances for his son. He always provides him with
                        the best things as well as his support, and he never gives him anything that
                        would harm him or disadvantage him. Similarly, Maudgalyāyana, for a long
                        time I have constantly perceived all sentient beings as if they were my only
                        child. Thus, for a long time I have constantly looked after what is best for
                        them and supported them. On the other hand, I have never given them anything

                        genuine path. Maudgalyāyana, for those reasons, you should know that for a
                        long time the Thus-Gone One has regarded sentient beings with strong
                        affection, perceiving them as a beloved and dear only child.</p>

                        without any friend, when a ferocious predator wanting to kill me and eat my
                        flesh appeared in front of me. Just before I died, I gave rise to the mind
                        set on awakening and made this aspiration, ‘After I die, may I be reborn as
                        a large animal in this isolated forest, and may some ferocious predators
                        kill me and thereby become fulfilled and satisfied.’ Why did I make this
                        aspiration? Because those ferocious predators always kill and eat the flesh
                        of small animals, and so they repeatedly commit the wrongdoing of killing.
                        Nevertheless, they never feel satiated and satisfied. This is the reason why
                        I made the aspiration, ‘May I be reborn here as a large animal, and may I
                        bring fulfillment and satisfaction to those flesh eaters and blood
                        drinkers.’</p>

                        suffering from hunger and thirst by offering my flesh and blood, there would
                        be no end to those accounts. Maudgalyāyana, in the past, I thus gave rise to
                        a compassionate attitude toward sentient beings afflicted by suffering.</p>

                        not be right if I were to abandon these beings without protection.’ So I
                        approached them and asked, ‘What kind of suffering are you experiencing?
                            <ref cRef="F.212.a" type="folio"/> What do you wish for?’</p>

                        what they wanted by cutting off my flesh, drawing blood from my body, and
                        offering this to them. However, Maudgalyāyana, at that time I never felt any
                        regret, sense of loss, sorrow, or depression. Instead, for a long time I

                        to an end.’ Therefore, even though I practiced generosity in that way, I
                        always felt utterly joyful and happy. You should know that, for those
                        reasons, the Thus-Gone One is extremely compassionate toward sentient

                        passed, he returned to his country and entered his city. At that time, some
                        criminals had been caught and tied up by their executioners, who were now
                        beating their drums, which produced a terrifying sound. <ref cRef="F.218.a" type="folio"/> On the way to the execution site, the executioners would play these drums

                        about to be executed, they saw Good Profit from a distance and cried,
                        ‘Merchant! Please protect us! Protect us from this execution and save our
                        lives! You are a great benefactor and a sublime being!’</p>

                        from this execution!’</p>

                    <p tid="500">“Good Profit then quickly went to the king. When he arrived in his
                        presence, he said, ‘Your Majesty, I would like to ransom the lives of those
                        men with these excellent gemstones.’</p>

                        unforgivable, so they are truly not for sale! However, if you sincerely want
                        to save them, give me all the wealth you possess, and I will revoke my
                        decision to kill them.’</p>

                    <p tid="502">“Maudgalyāyana, when he heard those words, Good Profit became
                        utterly delighted and said, ‘I am so fortunate! Now my wishes have been
                        fulfilled, since all I wanted was to protect those men.’ To protect the
                        prisoners and save them from their execution, Good Profit then offered the
                        king all the wealth he possessed at his home, in addition to all the
                        countless millions of precious gems, as well as all the gold and silver that
                        he had brought back from his journey across the ocean. He said to the king,
                        ‘Your Majesty, please release the men; here is all the wealth that I
                        possess.’</p>

                        Do as your king commands.’</p>
                    <p tid="504">“Following the order, Good Profit was tied up and led to the
                        scaffold. However, when the executioner raised his right hand and was about
                        to strike Good Profit with his weapon, his hand froze, and he could not
                        follow through. Filled with terror and surprise, he brought Good Profit to
                        the king and explained what had happened. Maudgalyāyana, when the king heard
                        about the event, he himself drew his sword and tried to kill Good Profit.
                        Then, just as he raised his sword and was about to strike, both the king’s
                        hands fell to the ground. Writhing in agony, the king cried out in terror
                        and died.</p>

                        to kill me but was once again unable. Why was it so? Because no one within

                        by various means, his wealth, fame, and strength were ruined, and he will

                        pleasing appearance, and he was powerful and wise. During the night, this

                        which was a dangerous and narrow path. However, some hunters had noticed the
                        elephants, and so they spent a whole night digging a huge pit on that
                        dangerous path, thinking, ‘When the elephants fall into this pit, they will
                        be ours, and we can easily take possession of them.’ Then, at the end of the
                        night when they had finished digging, they drove the herd of elephants onto
                        the fearsome path toward the pit. Although the elephants noticed the pit, it

                    <p tid="547">“Elephant Trunk, once in the past, I was a non-Buddhist sage. My
                        insight was clear and sharp, I was very erudite and eloquent, and I had
                        reached acceptance of the profound Dharma. At that time there were five
                        hundred young brahmins who understood the defects associated with keeping a
                        household and the five sense desires, as well as the benefits of monastic
                        life. Accordingly, they renounced their households, became ordained as
                        homeless monks, and cultivated the path. They all came to see me, and I
                        taught them the Dharma. They eventually reached the path of the solitary
                        buddhas, developed the six higher perceptions, and obtained mental freedom.
                        Endowed with the bases of miraculous powers, they would always miraculously
                        rise up into the sky, and in this way enter villages, cities, and towns.
                        After receiving their alms, they would then venerate me with them.</p>

                    <p tid="548">“At that time, I thought, ‘Since they possess pure and great
                        wisdom, it is not suitable for me to accept their offerings.’ In fact, those
                        sages had obtained such qualities by following my teachings, whereas I had
                        not! Therefore, in order to realize the Dharma that I had received but not
                        yet realized, I developed persistent diligence. <ref cRef="F.224.b" type="folio"/>

                    <p tid="549">“Elephant Trunk, after I gave rise to persistent diligence, I also
                        realized that Dharma. At that time a god from the pure realms arrived in
                        front of me and prophesied, ‘Do not cling to this wisdom! After you fully
                        awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, you will liberate innumerable
                        sentient beings.’ Elephant Trunk, after hearing those words, I obtained
                        supreme mental joy by cultivating the path. Then, as I sat in solitude for
                        half a month, my entire body became filled with bliss.</p>

                    <p tid="550">“Elephant Trunk, if bodhisattvas possess these four qualities, you
                        should know that the gods will instruct them, their minds will become
                        utterly joyful, and they will know that they themselves will attain
                        unsurpassed and perfect awakening. What are the four? (1) Once bodhisattvas
                        themselves have given rise to the mind set on awakening, they encourage
                        others to also give rise to that attitude. (2) When they see followers of
                        the Great Vehicle who have given rise to the mind set on awakening, they do
                        not become jealous—they do not think that only they should obtain
                        unsurpassed and perfect awakening, while others should not. (3) At
                        appropriate times they instruct sentient beings who adopt negative forms of
                        behavior. Conversing with them with a good heart, they protect their
                        virtues. (4) With great efforts, they themselves constantly pursue the
                        Dharma on a vast scale, and they teach it to others free from miserliness.
                        Elephant Trunk, if the bodhisattva great beings possess these four
                        qualities, you should know that the gods will instruct them, and they will
                        know that they themselves will attain unsurpassed and perfect awakening.” At

                        train in such an excellent Dharma? In the past, we were lazy and had no hope
                        of developing the insight of the buddhas, nor did we believe that we could
                        ever attain such insight. Therefore, we thought that we would be emancipated

                        Dharma of the Buddha. Why is that? Because the Buddha, the Blessed One, has
                        undergone great hardships. When he practiced bodhisattva conduct in the
                        past, he always engaged in such great hardships for the sake of sentient
                        beings. The worthy ones and the solitary buddhas are not able to undergo

                        One, after having engaged in such great hardships, those bodhisattvas will
                        awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. Then they will turn the Dharma
