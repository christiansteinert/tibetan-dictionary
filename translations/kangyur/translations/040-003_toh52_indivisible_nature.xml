                <p tid="1">While the Buddha is in the Jeta Grove, he asks Mañjuśrī to teach on the nature of reality. Mañjuśrī’s
                    account upsets some of the monks present in the gathering, who subsequently leave. Nevertheless, by means of
                    an emanation, Mañjuśrī skillfully teaches the distraught monks, who return to the Jeta Grove to express their
                    gratitude. The monks explain that their obstacle has been a conceited sense of attainment, of which they are
                    now free. At the request of the god Ratnavara, Mañjuśrī then teaches on nonduality and the nature of the
                    bodhisattva. Next, the Buddha prophesies the future awakening of Ratnavara and other bodhisattvas present in
                    the gathering. However, the prophecies cause Pāpīyān, king of the māras, to appear with his army. In a
                    dramatic course of events, Mañjuśrī uses his transformative power on both Pāpīyān and the Buddha’s pious
                    attendant, Śāradvatīputra, forcing both of them to appear in the form of the Buddha himself. He then makes
                    Pāpīyān and Śāradvatīputra teach the profound Dharma with the perfect mastery of buddhahood. Numerous
                    bodhisattvas appear from the four directions, pledging to practice and uphold the sūtra’s teaching. The Buddha
                    grants his blessing for the continuous transmission of the sūtra among bodhisattvas in the future.</p>

                    <p tid="5">The setting of the sūtra is the renowned Jeta Grove at Śrāvastī, a site donated to the Buddha and
                        his Saṅgha by the wealthy benefactor Anāthapiṇḍada, where the Buddha subsequently spent many annual
                        monsoon retreats. As the sūtra opens, we learn that eight thousand monks, twelve thousand bodhisattvas,
                        and thirty-two thousand gods who practice the mind of awakening have assembled around the Blessed One. The
                        god Ratnavara is also present in the assembly, and we witness him forming the wish that the Buddha may
                        inspire Mañjuśrī to teach the Dharma. Knowing Ratnavara’s thoughts, the Buddha turns to Mañjuśrī and
                        encourages him to explain the “realm of phenomena.” Mañjuśrī’s playful and profound response is to wonder
                        whether the very idea of such a teaching is at all intelligible. How could that which is present
                        everywhere possibly be singled out and set apart from anything? How could it be identified in any
                        meaningful way?</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-040-003-6"/>
                    <p tid="6">The “realm of phenomena,” the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharmadhātu</foreign>
                            (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">chos kyi dbyings</foreign>), about which the Buddha asks
                        Mañjuśrī to teach, is thus one of the key principles in this text. The treatise <title xml:lang="en">Distinguishing the Middle from Extremes</title> (Skt. <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Madhyāntavibhāga</title>)—attributed to Maitreya and transmitted by Asaṅga—enumerates this term among
                        five synonyms for emptiness, and goes on to explain that this particular term is constructed in
                        consideration of the way the perception of emptiness serves as the basis for attaining the qualities of
                        the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">āryas</foreign> or “noble beings.”<note place="end" index="6" xml:id="UT22084-040-003-315">See Maitreya-Asaṅga, <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Madhyāntavibhāga</title>,
                            I.14-15, folio 41.a.2.</note> In the sūtras and śāstras the bodhisattva’s liberation upon the first of
                        the ten stages is moreover typically described as the result of perceiving—directly and for the first
                        time—the omnipresent nature of the realm of phenomena.<note place="end" index="7" xml:id="UT22084-040-003-316">See Maitreya-Asaṅga, II.14, folio 42.a.1, and Vasubandhu’s commentary,
                            folio 9.a.6–9.b.2.</note> Thus, in responding to the Buddha’s request, Mañjuśrī takes up the
                        implications of this notion of omnipresence. He argues that given its constant and pervasive presence,
                        ultimate reality turns out to be indivisibly one with everything from which we may otherwise want to set
                        it apart: the flawed, the seeming, and the unreal. How could the true nature of things then be
                        distinguished or known in any way? This paradox is also discernible in the sūtra’s title: in declaring
                        that its objective is to show the indivisible nature of reality and ordinary experience, the sūtra
                        ventures to treat a theme that arguably, by definition, cannot even be identified as a topic. </p>

                    <p tid="7">This short-circuiting of the dichotomy between relative and ultimate truths—or of the distinction
                        between appearance and reality—recurs throughout the sūtra in a number of variations. Thus, as an upshot
                        of its radically nondual approach, the sūtra identifies the very notion of spiritual attainment as an
                        obstacle. The sense of having gained a superior result is hence classified as an affliction and associated
                        with saṃsāra. Yet the sūtra also teaches that exact knowledge of affliction and saṃsāra is itself the
                        purification of the latter two. The idea of a path from ignorance to awakening is further undermined when
                        Mañjuśrī, in reply to Ratnavara’s questions, for example, identifies the “beginner bodhisattva” in terms
                        of a realization that transcends both time and space. “Long-term experience,” on the other hand, Mañjuśrī
                        sees as descriptive only of beings who suffer in saṃsāra, and thus not of bodhisattvas. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-040-003-8"/>
                    <p tid="8">The sūtra acknowledges the potentially intimidating and alienating effects of its teaching of
                        nonduality, yet its response can be seen as both unrelenting and genuinely concerned. As the Buddha warns
                        Mañjuśrī that his teaching is likely to cause fear in the audience, Mañjuśrī replies, “Those who become
                        afraid are themselves of the nature of the realm of phenomena, and the nature of the realm of phenomena
                        does not become frightened.” Yet as a group of monks ends up leaving in distress, Mañjuśrī dispatches an
                        emanation of himself who, appearing to sympathize with the dejected monks in their dismissal of the
                        teaching, finally succeeds in showing them its deeper truth. It should also be noted that despite the
                        repeated rejection of the principles of liberation and spiritual accomplishment, we are repeatedly
                        informed about the liberating effects of the sūtra’s teaching when each section of discourse concludes, as
                        in many sūtras, with a statement of the resulting attainments of the attending monks, bodhisattvas, or
                        gods.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-040-003-9"/>
                    <p tid="9">The sūtra’s story line is dramatic and culminates in the transformation of both Pāpīyān—the ruler
                        of the māras, who create obstacles for those following the Dharma—and Śāradvatīputra (also known as
                        Śāriputra), who is the very image of spotless piety and adherence to the word of the Buddha. Starkly
                        against their wishes, both Pāpīyān and Śāradvatīputra are transformed and appear instead as awakened
                        buddhas. Once present as such, they engage in an astonishing Dharma dialogue, explaining to each other and
                        the audience the profound intent of Mañjuśrī’s teaching. Subsequent to this very graphic illustration of
                        the omnipresent nature of the realm of phenomena, the sūtra concludes with the Buddha asking Mañjuśrī to
                        bless the sūtra so that in future times it will be widely practiced. In a manner reminiscent of his
                        initial response to the Buddha’s call at the opening of the sūtra, Mañjuśrī wonders how he should
                        understand such a request, given the unborn and unceasing nature of all phenomena. Might the Blessed One,
                        Mañjuśrī wonders, perhaps also ask him to bless the unborn and unceasing element of space so that it may
                        remain unaffected by fire? Mañjuśrī instead chooses to entreat the Blessed One himself to bless the sūtra.
                        The Buddha complies and, having granted his blessing for the sūtra to be widely taught and practiced, he
                        asks Ānanda to recollect the sūtra, and also provides it with three alternative names. While for the most
                        part its teaching has been delivered by bodhisattvas, monks, and even by the king of māras, the sūtra ends
                        as is traditional with everyone rejoicing in the words of the Blessed One.</p>

                        Śrāvastī. He was residing there together with a great saṅgha of eight thousand monks, and with twelve
                        thousand bodhisattvas from various buddha realms, and thirty-two thousand gods, who had all genuinely
                        entered into unexcelled and perfect awakening. Youthful Mañjuśrī and the god Ratnavara had also joined the

                        teach the Dharma, he will surely teach so that all the abodes of the māras will be subdued and Māra the
                        evil one will despair. He will teach so that all opponents are defeated, and so that those possessed of
                        excessive pride will become free of their pride and reveal their knowledge.<note place="end" index="8" xml:id="UT22084-040-003-299"> Tib. <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">shes pa brda sprod pa ’gyur ba</title>.
                            This complex term appears frequently in this sūtra. Following <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāvyutpatti</title> 6419, the Sanskrit equivalent is <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ājñāvyākaraṇa</foreign>. In Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ājñā</foreign> means
                            “instruction,” “command,” or “order,” and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vyākaraṇa</foreign>
                            and the verb <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vyākaroti</foreign> mean “explain/explanation,”
                            “prophesy/prophecy,” “analyze/analysis,” “elucidate/elucidation,” or just “show,” “reveal/revelation,”

                                Dictionary</title> (Edgerton 1953) s.v. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ājñā</foreign>, we
                            see that <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ājñā</foreign> (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">shes pa</foreign>), in Buddhist texts, has the sense of “correct knowledge,” and that
                            it is a usage close to the Pāli equivalent <foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="term">aññā</foreign>, meaning
                            the sort of knowledge that comes with being an <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">arhat</foreign>.
                                <foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="term">Aññaṅ vyākaroti</foreign> is explained in <title xml:lang="en">The Pali Text Society’s Pali-English Dictionary</title> as “to manifest one’s Arahantship (by a
                            discourse or by mere exclamation).” See Pali Text Society s.v. <foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="term">aññā</foreign>: “knowledge, recognition, correct knowledge, philosophic insight, knowledge par
                            excellence, viz., Arahantship.” Based on these considerations, we translate <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vyākaraṇa</foreign> as “reveal” and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ājñā</foreign> as “knowledge,” thus here arriving at “will… reveal their knowledge.” </note> He
                        will teach so that those engaged in yogic practices will achieve their fruition, and so that those who
                        have already achieved fruition will gain further distinction. In this way the lineage of the Buddha,
                        Dharma, and Saṅgha will continue unbroken so that numerous beings will arouse the mind set on awakening.
                        The awakening that the Thus-Gone One has gained over incalculable eons will long remain and expand.
                        Whether the Thus-Gone One remains or passes entirely into nirvāṇa, the teaching of the Dharma <ref cRef="F.141.a" type="folio"/> will cause those who hear it to pass quickly beyond suffering by means of whichever

                        ripens sentient beings so as to subdue all views. While acting in full acquaintance with the absence of
                        marks, it nevertheless considers all sentient beings who engage with marks. Without any wishes, it
                        nevertheless perfects all aspirations for the sake of omniscient wisdom. In the discernment of the absence
                        of formations, it is nevertheless insatiable in forming roots of virtue. Since it sees entities as

                        by a realization of all entities and nonentities. It is not distinguished by the destruction of entities.
                        It is not distinguished by familiarization and the absence of entities. Still, it is not distinguished,

                            <term type="definition">This term usually has to do with a subjective state of ‘isolation,’
                                ‘separation,’ or ‘withdrawal,’ rather than a metaphysical idea. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Akṣayamatinirdeśa-sūtra</title> contains a more or less parallel discussion of <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">dben pa nyid</foreign> in connection with diligence: “<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">de la ’jug pa gang zhe na gang dge ba’i rtsa ba thams cad rtsom
                                    pa’o/ gnas pa gang zhe na. gangs sems dben pa’o</foreign>.” Jens Braarvig translates this
                                passage: “What then is activity? Undertaking all roots of good. What then is stillness? Aloofness
                                of thought.” (Braarvig, vol. 1, pp. 175-76; vol. 2, p. 50.) Here <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">sems dben pa</foreign> is glossed in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Akṣayamatinirdeśaṭīkā</title> (of Vasubandhu or perhaps Sthiramati) as: <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">sems dben pa ni mi dge ba spangs pa dang dge ba rtsom pa gang

                                and undertaking the virtuous.” In any case, the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">viviktatā</foreign> in this context and in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Akṣayamatinirdeśa</title> does not seem to be about emptiness, but more about a type of aloof
                                or disengaged diligence that does not conceptualize the virtues and non-virtues of the actions
                                undertaken.</term>
