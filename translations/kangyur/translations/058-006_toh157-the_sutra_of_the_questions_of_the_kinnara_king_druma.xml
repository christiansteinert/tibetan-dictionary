                        </note> is a scripture that belongs to the general sūtra section of the
            Tibetan Kangyur. The sūtra presents a series of teachings focusing on the doctrine of
            emptiness and the bodhisattvas’ perfections, presented in a rich narrative framework in
            which Druma, a king of the kiṃnaras, is the protagonist. Kiṃnaras are mythological
            beings found in both Buddhist and Hindu literature, where they are portrayed as
            creatures half human, half animal (usually half bird). They are also usually depicted as
            highly skilled celestial musicians. King Druma is himself a well-known figure in
            canonical Sanskrit sources, where he frequently appears, albeit mostly in minor roles,
            offering musical worship to the Buddha. For example, King Druma appears in such a role
            in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saddharmapuṇḍarīkasūtra</title> (Toh 113)<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-817" index="2"> See Peter Roberts, <ref target="http://read.84000.co/translation/toh113.html#UT22084-051-001-171">The White

          <p tid="587">The title of this text is actually somewhat misleading since the questions
            that bring forth the sūtra’s doctrinal content are not in fact posed by Druma, but
            instead by the bodhisattva Divyamauli, who is the primary interlocutor throughout this
            sūtra. As such Druma assumes the role of the teacher who over the course of the text
            displays a profound understanding of the doctrine of emptiness. The Buddha accordingly
            commends him for his grasp of the truth and extols Druma as a great bodhisattva whose
            level of realization far surpasses that of any hearer or solitary buddha. Toward the end
            of the teaching, the Buddha also prophesies Druma’s future awakening in great detail.
            Music plays a central role throughout this sūtra. As Paul Harrison has noted, music is
            presented in several episodes as a metaphor for the ungraspable nature of
            reality—emptiness—as it serves as the basis for Druma’s teachings to Divyamauli and the
            rest of the assembly.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-820" index="4"> Harrison
              1992, p. xv.</note> In one remarkable episode, the power of Druma’s music is such that
            even the accomplished elders among the monks lose control of their bodies and start to
            dance helplessly to the tune of Druma’s lute, while only those who have reached the
            bodhisattva levels are able to remain seated. Besides the doctrine of emptiness that is
            discussed at various points in the text, this sūtra also elaborates on a variety of
            general themes associated with the Great Vehicle, but special attention is given to the
            six perfections, in particular to the perfection of skillful means. The sūtra also
            contains a lengthy teaching on the ways in which women can be reborn with a male
            body—something that, according to several Great Vehicle sūtras, is a prerequisite for
            attaining awakening as a buddha.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-821" index="5"> For more on the theme of sexual transformation in Mahāyāna sūtras, as well as famous

              the ninth century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, centuries after the famous Middle Way

            While no Sanskrit manuscript of <title xml:lang="en">The Questions of the Kiṃnara King
              Druma</title> appears to be extant, we do have translations of this sūtra in both
            Chinese and Tibetan. Two Chinese translations are available: one produced by Lokakṣema
            (T.624) and the other by Kumārajīva (T.625). Lokakṣema was born around 147 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi> in Gandhara and is one of the earliest known persons to have
            translated the Great Vehicle Buddhist sūtras from Sanskrit into Chinese. The date of his
            translation is unknown, but Harrison suggests that it must have been produced while he
            was residing in the Han capital of Luoyang during the years 170–190 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. Lokakṣema’s version is therefore of great historical
            importance since it represents one of the earliest literary sources for the Great
            Vehicle available to us today.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-825" index="8">
              On this see Harrison 1992, pp. xiii–xiv.</note> The second Chinese translation was
            produced by the renowned translator Kumārajīva (334–413 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>),
            who completed the translation in the early fifth century, toward the end of his life, as
            he resided in the then Chinese capital of Chang’an. According to Harrison, the two
            Chinese versions are very similar, and they also do not differ substantially from the
              Tibetan.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-826" index="9"> Harrison 1992, p. xv.

            listed in the early ninth-century Denkarma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan dkar

            sūtra was translated into Tibetan by the prolific translators Kawa Paltsek (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ska ba dpal brtsegs</foreign>) and Palgi Lhunpo (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpal gyi lhun po</foreign>),<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-828" index="10"> Interestingly, the colophon of the Phukdrak

            projects in Tibet during the early translation period when the majority of Indian sūtras
            were translated into Tibetan (late eighth to early ninth century). Kawa Paltsek was also
            one of the initial seven Tibetans to be ordained during the founding of the first
            Tibetan monastery of Samyé (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bsam yas</foreign>). He
            translated numerous canonical texts, both sūtra and tantra, and became one of the most
            active translators of his time. Some Tibetan translators, including Palgi Lhunpo, are
            known to have translated certain Indian texts without the help of Indian teachers,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-829" index="11">On this see Pathak 1974, p.

          <p tid="590">Our translation work benefitted greatly from the work of Paul Harrison
            (1992), who published a full critical edition of the Tibetan text based on nine
            available witnesses—Stok Palace MS, London, Tokyo MS, Degé, Lithang, Peking, and
            Narthang, as well as the Phukdrak MS independent Kangyur and extant portions of a
            Dunhuang manuscript.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-831" index="12"> Apart
              from the critical edition of the sūtra, Harrison’s monograph also includes a brief
              introduction to the sūtra as well as a longer discussion of the textual transmission
              of the Kangyur that likewise proved to be very helpful for our work. His work also
              contains two appendices, one listing all the single reading variants between the nine
              witnesses, and the other presenting a transcription of the three citations from this
              sūtra that appear in the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Caryāmelāpakapradīpa</foreign>. </note> In his work, the different versions of the
            text are grouped under two recensions, representing the Thempangma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">them spangs ma</foreign>) and Tshalpa (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">tshal pa</foreign>) lines and respectively referred to as “Recension A” and
            “Recension B.” Stok Palace MS, London, and Tokyo MS are grouped under Recension A and
            Degé, Lithang, Peking, and Narthang<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-832" index="13"> For the <foreign xml:lang="la">stemma codicum</foreign> proposed by
              Harrison, see 1992, p. xxxvi. Although it is known to include readings from both
              transmission lines, the Narthang edition seems to exclusively follow the texts of the
              Tshalpa line in this case. </note> under Recension B. According to Harrison’s
            findings, the Phukdrak MS version of the text mostly agrees with the texts of the
            Thempangma line while the Dunhuang manuscript mostly corresponds with those of the
            Tshalpa line. He observes that these groups of versions belong to distinct “recensions”
            in that they reflect major “recensional variation”—significant editorial changes such as
            extensive alterations to the wording of the text and systematic substitution of
            different terminology—and not just “transmissional variation.” Those groups of texts are
            indeed quite different in ways that cannot be accounted for by scribal error or casual
              emendation.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-833" index="14"> On this, and for
              other related discussions, see Harrison 1992, pp. xii–xlix.</note> Harrison
            subsequently discovered while sifting through the damaged and disheveled Tabo Kangyur
            that about 13% of this text is preserved there too. Upon collating this with his

            takes to be “a fair but possibly later reflection of the fully revised translation

            the texts included in Recension A seem closer to standard revised translations than the
            texts included in Recension B, since they accord more with the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāvyutpatti</title>.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-837" index="17"> Although the texts of recension A
              still retain terms that were not revised, and the texts from recension B did not
              completely escape revision either.</note> Yet his conclusion, in the light of his
            analysis of the available witnesses of the text, is that “no representative . . . , no
            matter how venerable, may be given priority or regarded as invariably the ‘best text.’
            This means that variants between genuine witnesses . . . must be isolated and assessed

          <p tid="592">For this translation into English, which, as far as we are aware, is the
            first translation into any European language, we relied on the Degé blockprint, the
            Comparative Edition (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe bsdur ma</foreign>), and Paul
            Harrison’s edition. The Degé is the most widely circulating Kangyur. It primarily
            belongs to the Tshalpa line but also incorporates readings from the Thempangma line.
            Since it is mostly in line with Recension B, it often also accords more with our
            earliest witness, the Dunhuang manuscript. As such, it preserves earlier readings than
            those in Recension A, readings that have been much less altered by the great revision of
            the imperial period. We therefore concluded that reading the Degé text in close
            consultation with Harrison’s edition was a reasonable way to approach the translation of
            this text and to gain a fairly robust picture of the transmissional and recensional
            issues associated with it. We have revised the sigla used in Harrison’s edition (1992)

            seventy-two thousand bodhisattva great beings who had gathered from the worlds of the
            ten directions. All of them had developed the higher perceptions. They had attained
            recollection, unobstructed eloquence, and absorption. They were perfectly mindful,
            intelligent, realized, devoted, humble, and modest. Their motivation was firm and
            indivisible like vajra. They perfectly applied themselves to all the qualities of
            buddhahood, and they had developed the most noble motivation. Without ever forsaking the
            mind set on awakening, they caused others to adopt that same attitude. They were
            generous, self-controlled, restrained, gentle, and patient. They were giving away all
            sorts of pleasant things and knew how to dedicate these acts. Their bodies, speech, and
            minds were adorned with the ornament of discipline. They had an impartial attitude
            toward all beings and they had donned the powerful armors of patience and gentleness.
            They had exercised diligence for countless billions of eons, and they reveled in the
            wisdom of the concentrations, liberations, absorptions, attainments, and higher

            bodhisattvas who have reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena in this way
            are without cessation and are not in conflict with any phenomena. Their acceptance with
            respect to the self encompasses all sentient beings, and it also encompasses all
            phenomena, since it is beyond coming and going. They correctly know that all phenomena
            abide within the realm of phenomena and that the same goes for all beings. That
            <term type="ignore">attainment</term> whereby nothing is attained is referred to in conventional terms as ‘gaining
            acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.’ This acceptance of the unborn nature of
            phenomena cannot be expressed, described, or demonstrated. Why is it so? Because its
            meaning is inexpressible, beyond words, and indescribable. Noble son, this teaching in
            which the inexpressible meaning is nevertheless expressed demonstrates the greatness of

            means to ripen beings who have such propensities. (14) When the wives of merchants,
            householders, or kings have no children and experience the painful torment and suffering
            of wanting a child, the bodhisattvas accept being born as their child in order to cause

            (19) They appear within brothels or harems where they display attractive female bodies
            to ripen those who are caught by the hook of lust. (20) To ripen others with the Dharma
            in accordance with their individual inclinations, they manifest within great gatherings
            and large groups where they beautify whole areas with the music of their drums, kettle
            drums, flutes, and conch shells;<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-1065" index="66"> Translated based on S, T, and L: <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">rnga bo che dang/ mkhar rnga dang/ gling bu dang/ dung</foreign>. Harrison 1992, p.

            offer food and beverages to travelers who suffer from a lack of food and beverages; then
            they teach them the Dharma once they are relieved from hunger and thirst. (22) They

            (23) They intentionally manifest as thieves to ripen hundreds of beings who have engaged
            in various types of evil activities and who have been incarcerated in the royal prisons;
            when they are identified as rogues, they enter prison where, through their miraculous
            powers, they wash and anoint the bodies of the prisoners, dress them in fine clothes,
            and offer them food and beverages until they are fully satiated; then they release them
            from their tight shackles and teach them the Dharma in a way that they will definitely
            reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening. <ref cRef="F.286.a" type="folio"/> (24) To ripen beings who
            are led to the place of their execution at the king’s command, and who are tormented by
            suffering and the fear of dying, bodhisattva great beings miraculously emanate
            manifestations that free such condemned prisoners who are being led to their execution
            from their shackles; they then teach the Dharma to those beings who have been relieved
            from fear and whose lives have just been saved, in a way that they will definitely reach
            unsurpassed and perfect awakening. (25) Bodhisattva great beings skillfully remain
            wherever beings are involved in quarrels, disputes, fights, and conflicts about
            possessions, wealth, fields, household materials, male servants, female servants,
            workers, or soldiers; through their miraculous powers they settle the conflicts by
            giving away their possessions, wealth, and precious materials and, once the different
            parties have been thus reconciled, they cause them to embrace unsurpassed and perfect
            awakening. (26) Even though the bodhisattvas’ major and minor limbs are fully
            functional, they skillfully manifest with impaired abilities, in order to ripen sentient
            beings. (27) Even though the bodhisattvas’ conduct is perfect, they manifest all kinds
            of disturbed forms of conduct to ripen sentient beings. (28) Bodhisattvas adept in
            skilful means manifest themselves as non-Buddhists, and to attract non-Buddhists in
            faraway lands, who live in demonic domains under the influence of demons, to the
            teachings of the Buddha, they proclaim the praises of the Three Jewels in front of them.
            (29) To skillfully ripen others, bodhisattvas give up the concentrations, liberations,
            absorptions, and attainments, and intentionally take rebirth within the desire realm;
            they describe the suffering of birth to those who wish for nirvāṇa, <ref cRef="F.286.b" type="folio"/> and they teach about nirvāṇa to cause those who have attained disengagement to
            cultivate the highest path. (30) Bodhisattvas skillfully display the bodies of buddhas
            to those who aspire to reach nirvāṇa but who have not yet entered the faultless state.
            (31) To cause beings who have faith in the Buddha and whose minds are settled to embrace
            the mind set on awakening, they teach them how to attain understanding of this

            and skill in means, the retinue of the kiṃnara king Druma and ninety-eight thousand
            beings including gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and gandharvas gave rise to the mind set on
            unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Among the retinue of the Blessed One, eighteen
            thousand bodhisattvas reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. The kiṃnara

            cheerful, thrilled, and elated. With joy and happiness filling his mind, he draped the
            Blessed One in a single piece of invaluable fabric. He also draped each member of the
            saṅgha of bodhisattvas and each member of the saṅgha of hearers with cloths of
            inestimable value, and offered all his dwelling places for the enjoyment of the Blessed
            One. Then, eight thousand sons of the kiṃnara king Druma offered shade to the Blessed
            One with an array of precious lotuses and eight thousand precious parasols. <ref cRef="F.287.a" type="folio"/> In that very moment, through the power of the Buddha, all those
            parasols merged to form a single precious parasol in the sky, about a thousand leagues
            above the courtyard, right over the Blessed One’s head. When the eight thousand sons of
            the kiṃnara king Druma saw this great miraculous display manifested by the Blessed One,
            they became satisfied, cheerful, thrilled, and elated. With joy and happiness filling
            their minds, they gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening with
            determination and supplicated the Blessed One: “Blessed One, Thus-Gone One, Worthy One,
            Perfect Buddha, please tell us about the qualities that mature into awakening so that,
            upon hearing about them, we may accomplish the factors of awakening!”</p>

            delightful music, without anyone playing them. The sound of music also rang out from all
            the fragrant, flowering, and blooming trees growing on the majestic Mt. Gandhamādana.
            Next, myriads of light rays shone from all the pores of the Blessed One’s skin, and
            lotus flowers the size of chariot wheels manifested on the tip of each light ray. At the
            heart of each lotus flower bodhisattvas appeared, displaying pure bodies adorned with

            that accomplishes the benefit of all beings. It is for the sake of all beings that
            bodhisattvas put on the great armor with which they can lead a countless and limitless

            in this manner you should understand that, whether I am still alive or have passed
            beyond suffering, those who look after the bodhisattvas are looking after all beings.
            Friends, those who serve the bodhisattvas by offering them Dharma robes, alms, bedding,
            medicine, and provisions serve all beings. Friends, those who provide pleasing articles
            to the bodhisattvas provide pleasing articles to all beings. Why is it so? Friends, it
            is because even the mere breathing <ref cRef="F.305.b" type="folio"/> of bodhisattvas is done out of
            great compassion for all beings. They look after all beings for the sake of their
            benefit and happiness.”</p>

            others?”</p>
          <p tid="1138">“Ānanda,” replied the Blessed One, “imagine that a noble son or daughter
            practices generosity by, in the morning, filling this entire great trichiliocosm with
            the seven precious substances and offering this to the stream enterers, the once
            returners, the nonreturners, the worthy ones, the solitary buddhas, and the thus-gone
            ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas. Similarly, imagine that he or she practices
            generosity by filling, at noon, during the afternoon, <ref cRef="F.316.a" type="folio"/> at dusk,
            during nighttime, and at dawn, all the worlds of the great trichiliocosm with the seven
            precious substances and offering this to all of them. Then, imagine that he or she
            practices generosity on that scale for a year, for a hundred years, for a thousand
            years, and for a hundred thousand years. What do you think Ānanda, would that noble son
            or daughter generate a lot of merit on that basis?”</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-1451"/>
          <p tid="1139">“Blessed One, the amount of merit generated would be huge! It would be
            immeasurable! Blissful One, the merit generated would be boundless! Blessed One, the
            heap of merit generated from doing this for one day is immeasurable, to say nothing of
            the heap of merit generated by practicing such generosity for a hundred thousand
            years!”</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-1452"/>
          <p tid="1140">“Ānanda, think about this and understand this point: if someone who strives
            to reach awakening, to turn the wheel of Dharma, and to liberate beings, is devoted to
            this Dharma teaching upon hearing it, and then keeps it in mind, holds it, reads it, and
            comprehends it, such a noble son or daughter who follows the Great Vehicle will generate
            a bigger amount of merit than that. That being so, what need is there to mention the
            merit generated by those who put it into practice in accordance with reality?! Why is it
            so? Because, Ānanda, keeping in mind even a single verse of four lines from this Dharma
            teaching, holding it, reading it, comprehending it, and fully teaching it to others is
            known as <distinct>generosity</distinct>, and that generosity surpasses all other forms
            of generosity. Generosity with the Dharma is the supreme form of generosity, assistance
            with the Dharma is the supreme form of assistance, the act of spreading the Dharma is
            the supreme form of action, <ref cRef="F.316.b" type="folio"/> and the acquisition of the Dharma is
            the supreme form of acquisition. Why is it so? Because, Ānanda, generosity with the
            Dharma will cause afflictions to decrease while generosity with material things will
            merely support the body. Therefore, Ānanda, bodhisattvas who wish to reduce their
            afflictions should practice generosity with the Dharma authorized by the Buddha. Through
            this generosity with the Dharma, all extraordinary qualities will be attained. </p>

          <p tid="1141">“The bodhisattvas who practice generosity with the Dharma will gain

            will manifest the seeds of magnificent retention. (27) They will acquire the cause of
            uninterrupted eloquence. (28) They will be served by wise beings. (29) They will acquire

            Improper contemplation will not arise in their minds. (32) They will surpass all forms
            of mundane generosity related to material things and acquire the inexhaustible Dharma
            treasure. Ānanda, if bodhisattvas practice generosity with the Dharma, they will acquire
            those thirty-two excellent and extraordinary qualities.”</p>

                eating only what can be eaten in one sitting; (6) eating only food received in the
