                        scripture that belongs to the general sūtra section of the Tibetan Kangyur.
                        The sūtra presents a series of teachings focusing on the doctrine of
                        emptiness and the bodhisattvas’ perfections, presented in a rich narrative
                        framework in which Druma, a king of the kiṃnaras, is the protagonist.
                        Kiṃnaras are mythological beings found in both Buddhist and Hindu
                        literature, where they are portrayed as creatures half human, half animal
                        (horse or bird). They are also usually depicted as highly skilled celestial
                        musicians. King Druma is himself a well-known figure in canonical Sanskrit
                        sources, where he frequently appears, albeit mostly in minor roles, offering
                        musical worship to the Buddha. For example, King Druma appears in such a
                        role in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saddharmapuṇḍarīkasūtra</title> (Toh

                    <p tid="8">The title of this text is actually somewhat misleading since the questions
                        that bring forth the sūtra’s doctrinal content are not in fact posed by
                        Druma, but instead by the bodhisattva Devamukuṭa, who is the primary
                        interlocutor throughout this sūtra. As such Druma assumes the role of the
                        teacher who over the course of the text displays a profound understanding of
                        the doctrine of emptiness. The Buddha accordingly commends him for his grasp
                        of the truth and extols Druma as a great bodhisattva whose level of
                        realization far surpasses that of any hearer or solitary buddha. Toward the
                        end of the teaching, the Buddha also prophesies Druma’s future awakening in
                        great detail. Music plays a central role throughout this sūtra. As Paul
                        Harrison has noted, music is presented in several episodes as a metaphor for
                        the ungraspable nature of reality—emptiness—as it serves as the basis for
                        Druma’s teachings to Devamukuṭa and the rest of the assembly.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-7" index="4"> Harrison 1992, p. xv.</note> In one remarkable episode, the
                        power of Druma’s music is such that even the accomplished elders among the
                        monks lose control of their bodies and start to dance helplessly to the tune
                        of Druma’s lute, while only those who have reached the bodhisattva levels
                        are able to remain seated. Besides the doctrine of emptiness that is
                        discussed at various points in the text, this sūtra also elaborates on a
                        variety of general themes associated with the Great Vehicle, but special
                        attention is given to the six perfections, in particular to the perfection
                        of skillful means. The sūtra also contains a lengthy teaching on the ways in
                        which women can be reborn with a male body—something that, according to
                        several Great Vehicle sūtras, is a prerequisite for attaining awakening as a
                        buddha.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-8" index="5"> For more on the theme of sexual transformation in

                        have translations of this sūtra in both Chinese and Tibetan. Two Chinese
                        translations are available: one produced by Lokakṣema (T.624) and the other
                        by Kumārajīva (T.625). Lokakṣema was born around 147 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi> in Gandhara and is one of the earliest known persons to have
                        translated the Great Vehicle Buddhist sūtras from Sanskrit into Chinese. The
                        date of his translation is unknown, but Harrison suggests that it must have
                        been produced while he was residing in the Han capital of Luoyang during the
                        years 170–190 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. Lokakṣema’s version is
                        therefore of great historical importance since it represents one of the
                        earliest literary sources for the Great Vehicle available to us today.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-12" index="8"> On this see Harrison 1992, pp. xiii–xiv.</note> The second
                        Chinese translation was produced by the renowned translator Kumārajīva
                        (334–413 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>), who completed the translation in
                        the early fifth century, toward the end of his life, as he resided in the
                        then Chinese capital of Chang’an. According to Harrison, the two Chinese
                        versions are very similar, and they also do not differ substantially from
                        the Tibetan.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-13" index="9"> Ibid., p. xv. </note>

                        majority of Indian sūtras were translated into Tibetan (late eighth to early
                        ninth century). Kawa Paltsek was also one of the initial seven Tibetans to
                        be ordained during the founding of the first Tibetan monastery of Samyé
                            (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bsam yas</foreign>). He translated numerous
                        canonical texts, both sūtra and tantra, and became one of the most active
                        translators of his time. Some Tibetan translators, including Palgi Lhunpo,
                        are known to have translated certain Indian texts without the help of Indian

                    <p tid="11">Our translation work benefitted greatly from the work of Paul Harrison
                        (1992), who published a full critical edition of the Tibetan text based on
                        nine available witnesses—Stok Palace MS, London, Tokyo MS, Degé, Lithang,
                        Peking, and Narthang, as well as the Phukdrak MS independent Kangyur and
                        extant portions of a Dunhuang manuscript.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-18" index="12"> Apart from the
                            critical edition of the sūtra, Harrison’s monograph also includes a
                            brief introduction to the sūtra as well as a longer discussion of the
                            textual transmission of the Kangyur that likewise proved to be very
                            helpful for our work. His work also contains two appendices, one listing
                            all the single reading variants between the nine witnesses, and the
                            other presenting a transcription of the three citations from this sūtra
                            that appear in the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Caryāmelāpaka­pradīpa</foreign>. 
                        </note> In his work, the different versions of the text are grouped under
                        two recensions, representing the Tshalpa (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">tshal
                            pa</foreign>) and Thempangma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">them spangs
                            ma</foreign>) lines and respectively referred to as “Recension A” and
                        “Recension B.” Stok Palace MS, London, and Tokyo MS are grouped under
                        Recension A and Degé, Lithang, Peking, and Narthang<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-19" index="13">
                            Although it is known to include readings from both transmissions lines,
                            the Narthang edition seems to exclusively follow the texts of the
                            Tshalpa line in this case. </note> under Recension B. According to
                        Harrison’s findings, the Phukdrak MS version of the text mostly agrees with
                        the texts of the Thempangma line while the Dunhuang manuscript is mostly in
                        line with those of the Tshalpa line. He observes that these groups of
                        versions belong to distinct “recensions” in that they reflect major
                        “recensional variation”—significant editorial changes such as extensive
                        alterations to the wording of the text and systematic substitution of
                        different terminology—and not just “transmissional variation.” Those groups
                        of texts are indeed quite different in ways that cannot be accounted for by
                        scribal error or casual emendation.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-20" index="14"> On this, and for

                    <p tid="12"> Harrison’s critical edition is of Recension A, which he takes to be “a fair
                        but possibly later reflection of the fully revised translation produced at
                        the beginning of the ninth century.”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-22" index="15"> Ibid., p.
                            liii.</note> He argues that the texts included in Recension A seem
                        closer to standard revised translations than the texts included in Recession
                        B, since they accord more with the Mahāvyutpatti.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-23" index="16">
                            Although the texts of recension A still retain terms that were not
                            revised, and the texts from recension B did not completely escape
                            revision either. </note> Yet his conclusion, in the light of his
                        analysis of the available witnesses of the text, is that “no representative
                        . . ., no matter how venerable, may be given priority or regarded as
                        invariably the ‘best text.’ This means that variants between genuine
                        witnesses . . . must be isolated and assessed on a case-by-case basis.”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-006-24" index="17"> Ibid., pp. xlvi–xlvii. </note>

                    <p tid="13">For this translation into English, which, as far as we are aware, is the
                        first translation into any European language, we relied on the Degé
                        blockprint, the Comparative Edition (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe bsdur
                            ma</foreign>), and Paul Harrison’s edition. The Degé is the most widely
                        circulating Kangyur. It primarily belongs to the Tshalpa line but also
                        incorporates readings from the Thempangma line. Since it is mostly in line
                        with Recension B, it often also accords more with our earliest witness, the
                        Dunhuang manuscript. As such, it preserves earlier readings than those in
                        Recension A, readings that have been much less altered by the great revision
                        of the imperial period. We therefore concluded that reading the Degé text in
                        close consultation with Harrison’s edition was a reasonable way to approach
                        the translation of this text and to gain a fairly robust picture of the
                        transmissional and recensional issues associated with it. We have revised
                        the sigla used in Harrison’s edition (1992) to accord with those used by the

                        Peak by Rājagṛha together with a great saṅgha of sixty-two thousand monks,
                        and with seventy-two thousand bodhisattva great beings who had gathered from
                        the worlds of the ten directions. All of them had developed the higher
                        perceptions. They had attained recollection, unobstructed eloquence, and
                        absorption. They were perfectly mindful, intelligent, realized, devoted,
                        humble, and modest. Their motivation was firm and indivisible like vajra.
                        They perfectly applied themselves to all the qualities of buddhahood, and
                        they had developed the most noble motivation. Without ever forsaking the
                        mind set on awakening, they caused others to adopt that same attitude. They
                        were generous, self-controlled, restrained, gentle, and patient. They were
                        giving away all sorts of pleasant things and knew how to dedicate these
                        acts. Their bodies, speech, and minds were adorned with the ornament of
                        discipline. They had an impartial attitude toward all beings and they had
                        donned the powerful armors of patience and gentleness. They had exercised
                        diligence for countless billions of eons, and they reveled in

                        higher knowledge. They were experts in the wisdom and insight of

                        soon as it is perceived, and once it ceases, it remains within the essential
                        nature of space. It is therefore said that all phenomena are the same as
                        space. Even though they are surely beyond perception and impossible to know,
                        they are expressed through words and verbal expressions, and those
                        expressions are designations. Those who understand verbal expressions in
                        this way are not attached to anything; those who are not attached do not
                        generate conceptual elaboration; those who do not generate conceptual
                        elaboration do not circle around; those who do not circle around are
                        unbreakable; those who are unbreakable do not take birth; those who are not
                        born do not perish; those who do not perish are pure; those who are pure are

                        are clear; and clarity is the nature of the mind. The nature of the mind is
                        penetration; penetration overcomes all marks; and those who overcome all
                        marks are said to enter into faultlessness. <ref cRef="F.268.b"/> The

                        the darkness of ignorance and stupidity. (27) They possess the light of
                        insight by understanding that no phenomena come from or go anywhere, and
                        they teach all beings the Dharma that leads to liberation. (28) They display
                        the process of the death and rebirth of beings by understanding action and
                        activities. (29) They have attained the four correct knowledges through

                        composed, calm, liberated, collected, and learned. (31) Upon seeing that
                        emancipation results from insight, they uphold the sacred Dharma and thereby

                        if they possess thirty-two features. What are those thirty-two? They are as
                        follows: (1) Bodhisattvas look after beings by not actualizing exhaustion.
                        (2) They abide by great merit in order to ripen all beings. <ref cRef="F.285.a"/> (3) They do not search for worthy recipients of
                        generosity since all beings are worthy recipients of generosity. (4) They do
                        not hanker after grandeur so that they can ripen destitute beings. (5) They
                        manifest as mutes and stutterers to cause all beings to control their
                        speech. (6) They assume the forms of women in order to ripen women and
                        girls. (7) They assume the physical forms of children to ripen children. (8)
                        They assume all types of physical forms to ripen others in the appropriate
                        manner. (9) Even though they are not insane, they display that state to
                        ripen insane beings. (10) They assume the physical forms of madmen and
                        disturbed beings to teach the Dharma to those who have such propensities.
                        (11) They forsake the aggregate of discipline, accumulated over a hundred
                        years, to ripen beings. (12) They manifest joy, universal love, and
                        enjoyments to cause others to adopt the Dharma. (13) They assume the
                        physical forms of beings earning their livelihood through unsuitable and
                        crooked means to ripen beings who have such propensities. (14) When the
                        wives of merchants, householders, or kings have no children and experience
                        the painful torment and suffering of wanting a child, the bodhisattvas
                        accept being born as their child in order to cause them to develop faith in
                        virtue and to ripen them. (15) In order to distribute food, beverages,
                        wealth and other goods to destitute beings wandering in wilderness, they
                        manifest as merchants leading many travelers, place great treasures in front
                        of them, and teach them the Dharma after having offered them vast amounts of
                        wealth. (16) They eliminate the torments of those who experience the pain of
                        suffering before teaching them the Dharma through their miraculous powers.
                        (17) They manifest great treasures in front of those who have lost their
                        wealth before teaching them the Dharma to purify their livelihood. <ref cRef="F.285.b"/> (18) They manifest as renunciates among the

                        the Buddha. (19) They appear within brothels or harems where they display
                        attractive female bodies to ripen those who are caught by the hook of lust.
                        (20) To ripen others with the Dharma in accordance with their individual
                        inclinations, they manifest within great gatherings and large groups where
                        they beautify whole areas with the music of their drums, kettle drums,

                        higher perceptions and out of great love, they offer food and beverages to
                        travelers who suffer from a lack of food and beverages; then they teach them
                        the Dharma once they are relieved from hunger and thirst. (22) They manifest

                        powers, they offer food and beverages to such destitute blind people, and
                        cause them to recover their eyesight so that they can see their physical
                        forms; then they teach them the Dharma in a way that they will definitely
                        reach unsurpassed and perfect awakening. (23) They intentionally manifest as
                        thieves to ripen hundreds of beings who have engaged in various types of
                        evil activities and who have been incarcerated in the royal prisons; when
                        they are identified as rogues, they enter prison where, through their
                        miraculous powers, they wash and anoint the bodies of the prisoners, dress
                        them in fine clothes, and offer them food and beverages until they are fully
                        satiated; then they release them from their tight shackles and teach them
                        the Dharma in a way that they will definitely reach unsurpassed and perfect
                        awakening. <ref cRef="F.286.a"/> (24) To ripen beings who are led to the
                        place of their execution at the king’s command, and who are tormented by
                        suffering and the fear of dying, bodhisattva great beings miraculously
                        emanate manifestations that free such condemned prisoners who are being led
                        to their execution from their shackles; they then teach the Dharma to those
                        beings who have been relieved from fear and whose lives have just been
                        saved, in a way that they will definitely reach unsurpassed and perfect
                        awakening. (25) Bodhisattva great beings skillfully remain wherever beings
                        are involved in quarrels, disputes, fights, and conflicts about possessions,
                        wealth, fields, household materials, male servants, female servants,
                        workers, or soldiers; through their miraculous powers they settle the
                        conflicts by giving away their possessions, wealth, and precious materials
                        and, once the different parties have been thus reconciled, they cause them
                        to embrace unsurpassed and perfect awakening. (26) Even though the
                        bodhisattvas’ major and minor limbs are fully functional, they skillfully
                        manifest with impaired abilities, in order to ripen sentient beings. (27)
                        Even though the bodhisattvas’ conduct is perfect, they manifest all kinds of
                        disturbed forms of conduct to ripen sentient beings. (28) They teach
                        non-Buddhists through their skill in means. (29) To attract non-Buddhists in
                        faraway lands, who live in demonic domains under the influence of demons, to
                        the teachings of the Buddha, they proclaim the praises of the Three Jewels
                        in front of them. (30) To skillfully ripen others, bodhisattvas give up the
                        concentrations, liberations, absorptions, and attainments, and intentionally
                        take rebirth within the desire realm; they describe the suffering of birth
                        to those who wish for nirvāṇa, <ref cRef="F.286.b"/> and they teach about
                        nirvāṇa to cause those who have attained disengagement to cultivate the
                        highest path. (31) Bodhisattvas skillfully display the bodies of buddhas to
                        those who aspire to reach nirvāṇa but who have not yet entered the faultless
                        state. (32) To cause beings who have faith in the Buddha and whose minds are
                        settled to embrace the mind set on awakening, they teach them how to attain
                        understanding of this conditioning factor. Lord of the kiṃnaras, you should
                        know that bodhisattva great beings are skilled in means through those
                        thirty-two features.” </p>

                        thousand beings including gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and gandharvas gave rise to
                        the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Among the retinue of the
                        Blessed One, eighteen thousand bodhisattvas reached acceptance of the unborn
                        nature of phenomena. The kiṃnara king Druma reached the absorption called

                        his mind, he draped the Blessed One in a single piece of invaluable fabric.
                        He also draped each member of the saṅgha of bodhisattvas and each member of
                        the saṅgha of hearers with cloths of inestimable value, and offered all his
                        dwelling places for the enjoyment of the Blessed One. Then, eight thousand
                        sons of the kiṃnara king Druma offered shade to the Blessed One with an

                        cheerful, thrilled, and elated. With joy and happiness filling their minds,

                        into awakening so that, upon hearing about them, we may accomplish the

                        Blessed One rose up in the air to a height of seven palm trees and hovered
                        cross-legged. His body shone with light, illuminating this entire great
                        trichiliocosm with a bright light. All the various musical instruments of

                        playing them. The sound of music also rang out from all the fragrant,
                        flowering, and blooming trees growing on the majestic Mt. Gandhamādana.
                        Next, myriads of light rays shone from all the pores of the Blessed One’s
                        skin, and lotus flowers the size of chariot wheels manifested on the tip of
                        each light ray. At the heart of each lotus flower bodhisattvas appeared,
                        displaying pure bodies adorned with the thirty-two marks of great beings.
                        Then, through the power of the Buddha, all the musical instruments resounded
                        with questions, posed in verse, <ref cRef="F.287.b"/> which were each
                        clearly answered by the bodhisattvas, who replied in chorus, and also in

                        bodhisattvas, he looks after all beings. Friends, when the Thus-Gone One
                        looks after the bodhisattvas, that accomplishes the benefit of all beings.
                        It is for the sake of all beings that bodhisattvas put on the great armor
                        with which they can lead a countless and limitless number of beings away
                        from cyclic existence to the transcendence of suffering. Friends, in this
                        manner you should understand that, whether I am still alive or have passed
                        beyond suffering, those who look after the bodhisattvas are looking after
                        all beings. Friends, those who serve the bodhisattvas by offering them
                        Dharma robes, alms, bedding, medicine, and provisions serve all beings.
                        Friends, those who provide pleasing articles to the bodhisattvas provide
                        pleasing articles to all beings. Why is it so? Friends, it is because even
                        the mere breathing <ref cRef="F.305.b"/> of bodhisattvas is done out of
                        great compassion for all beings. They look after all beings for the sake of
                        their benefit and happiness.”</p>

                        develops interest in this Dharma teaching upon hearing it, and then keeps it

                        generated by those who accomplish it accordingly?! Why is it so? Because,

                        supreme form of acceptance. Why is it so? Because, Ānanda, the generosity of
                        the Dharma will cause afflictions to decrease while the generosity of
                        material things will merely support the body. Therefore, Ānanda,
                        bodhisattvas who wish to reduce their afflictions should practice the

                                consolidation; the fourth consists of the full entrance to the
                                infinity of space through transcending all conceptions of matter,
                                and the subsequent decline of conceptions of resistance and
                                discredit of conceptions of diversity; the fifth consists of full
                                entrance into the infinity of consciousness, having transcended the
                                infinity of space; the sixth consists of the full entrance into the
                                sphere of nothingness, having transcended the sphere of the infinity
                                of conscious­ness; the seventh consists of the full entrance into
                                the sphere of neither conscious­ness nor un­conscious­ness, having
                                transcended the sphere of nothingness; the eighth consists of the

                                neither conscious­ness nor un­conscious­ness. Thus the first three
                                liberations form specific links to the ordinary perceptual world;
                                the fourth to seventh are equivalent to the four absorptions; and
                                the eighth represents the highest attainment.</term>
