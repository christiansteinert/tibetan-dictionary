                        absorption, as well as for its unique discussion of the stages of a
                        bodhisattva’s journey and the qualities that pertain to them.</p>

                    <p tid="8">This scripture appears to have enjoyed some measure of sustained
                        popularity in Asia. The earliest Chinese translation (out of three: T 632, T
                        633, and T 634) was completed by the translator Chih-ch’ien sometime between
                        223 and 253 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, while the Tibetan translation was
                        commissioned almost six centuries later during the dynastic translation
                        efforts of the early ninth century. In between these two notable efforts to
                        propagate the sūtra outside of India, we also know of at least one citation
                        of this text in the works of an Indian scholar: that of Bhāviveka (sixth
                        century) in his <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Tarkajvālā</title>.<note place="end" index="1" xml:id="UT22084-055-005-5"> See Eckel 1994:
                            166.</note> As such, we have evidence of a continued relevance of this
                        sūtra during the formative centuries of the Great Vehicle tradition in
                        India. To our knowledge, this scripture has until now remained unexplored by
                        modern scholars, and no translation of the text has been made since the
                        Tibetan translation was produced in the early ninth century. This English
                        rendering was based on the Tibetan Degé block print with reference to the
                        Comparative Edition (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe bsdur ma</title>) and the
                        Stok Palace manuscript. Since no extant Sanskrit manuscript remains, we have
                        based our translation exclusively on these Tibetan source texts.</p>

                    <p tid="9">The sūtra’s title contains the Sanskrit term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">samādhi</foreign> (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">ting nge ’dzin</foreign>), which is a
                        feature shared by several sūtra titles in the Kangyur. The redactors of the
                        Degé Kangyur grouped them together, suggesting that they construed these
                        sūtras to form an unofficial subgenre of sūtra literature.<note place="end" index="2" xml:id="UT22084-055-005-7"> In the Degé Kangyur, this group
                            consists of eleven sūtras (Toh 127–37). This grouping is not unique to
                            the Degé, as it is also found in the Choné, Lhasa, and Narthang
                            Kangyurs, which means it is probably typical of all Tshalpa recensions. The
                            Thempangma recension Kangyurs locate it differently, and seemingly
                            without any similar classificatory principle.</note> However, the term’s
                        significance clearly varies from sūtra to sūtra within this group of texts.
                        For example, in the famous <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Samādhirājasūtra</title>
                        (Toh 127), <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">samādhi</foreign> does not
                        appear to refer to an altered state of mind, or to meditative absorption.
                        Instead, the term is used to encapsulate a list of affects, qualities, or
                        concepts that the sūtra presents, with no explicit mention of states of deep
                        meditative concentration.<note place="end" index="3" xml:id="UT22084-055-005-8"> See Peter Alan Roberts, trans. <title xml:lang="en">

                        most other sūtras within this group of texts,<note place="end" index="4" xml:id="UT22084-055-005-9"> Such as, for example, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Praśāntaviniścayaprātihāryasamādhi</title> (Toh
                            129), <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Māyopamasamādhi</title> (Toh 130), and
                                <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sarvapuṇyasamuccayasamādhi</title> (Toh
                            134).</note> the term clearly refers to a specific kind of meditative
                        state to be accessed and accomplished.<note place="end" index="5" xml:id="UT22084-055-005-10"> For further reading, see Skilton
                            2002.</note> It is to this latter group that the current sūtra belongs,
                        as it explicitly describes a meditative absorption, which the rest of the
                        title qualifies as “the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal.” Here,
                        <distinct>thus-gone one</distinct> (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tathāgatha</foreign>) is a common epithet of a fully
                        awakened being. We have translated this term from the Tibetan <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">de bzhin gshegs pa</foreign>, “one who has
                        thus gone,” whereas the Chinese equivalent, <foreign xml:lang="Zh-Ltn" type="term">ru lai</foreign>, reads closer to “thus-come one.” The final
                        term, <distinct>wisdom seal</distinct> (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">jñānamudrā</foreign>), qualifies the absorption in which the
                        thus-gone one dwells. <distinct>Seal</distinct> (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">mudrā</foreign>) has a rich and varied
                        usage in Buddhist literature. Generally, it refers to a stamp or brand, like
                        a royal seal that is used to mark property. Since the thus-gone one’s
                        absorption is infinite and unimpeded, all of reality falls into its domain.
                        Thus, all of reality is subsumed in, or sealed by, the wisdom actualized in
                        this absorption.</p>

                    <p tid="10">Like many Great Vehicle sūtras, <title xml:lang="en">The Absorption
                            of the Thus-Gone One’s Wisdom Seal</title> situates ancient India and
                        Buddha Śākyamuni in a much larger, cosmic context. The opening scene takes
                        place in the famous Veṇuvana (Bamboo Grove) monastic compound near Rājagṛha,
                        the capital of the former kingdom of Magadha (present-day Bihar). Located
                        nearby is the famed Vulture Peak Mountain, where Buddha Śākyamuni is said to
                        have delivered many Great Vehicle discourses. Here the Buddha is dwelling
                        with a vast retinue of monks and bodhisattvas when he enters into an exalted
                        state of absorption called <distinct>the thus-gone one’s wisdom
                            seal</distinct>, describable only in ways that suggest its sheer
                        ineffability: it is “formless, indefinable, ungraspable, unimpeded, and not
                        apparent.”</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-005-12"/>
                    <p tid="11">The power of this state of absorption affects the entire
                        trichiliocosm, inspiring buddhas and bodhisattvas dwelling in faraway realms
                        to intensify their spiritual activity. Cosmic buddhas exhort their
                        innumerable bodhisattva disciples to seize the opportunity to go to Veṇuvana
                        and learn about this absorption, which will be the culmination of their
                        training. Accordingly, the bodhisattvas magically travel there, eager to
                        receive teachings about this exalted state. Countless gods and nonhuman
                        beings, hearers, and monks join them in their quest. When they arrive,
                        however, the Buddha is nowhere to be seen, as their perceptions are not
                        attuned to the level of absorption in which he abides. In dismay, the
                        assembly, led by a group of close disciples including Mahā­maudgalyāyana and
                        Subhūti, turns to the great bodhisattva Mañjuśrī for advice on how to
                        communicate with the Buddha. He simply tells them to look inward: they will
                        find the Buddha within their own absorptions.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-005-13"/>
                    <p tid="12">Thus, a line of communication is established with the Buddha, who
                        now begins to teach them about this absorption, which is the hallmark of all
                        thus-gone ones. The teaching follows an extensive apophatic methodology, in
                        which the Buddha negates any proposition that may be made about this most
                        profound state of absorption: “This absorption is formless, indefinable,
                        ungraspable, unimpeded, and not apparent. It is beyond knowledge and not an
                        object of knowledge.” Upon concluding his teaching about
                            the <distinct>absorption of the thus-gone one’s
                            wisdom seal</distinct>, all those in attendance purify negative karma
                        accumulated over innumerable eons and no longer regress from unsurpassed and
                        perfect awakening.</p>

                    <p tid="13">The discourse then shifts, and the Buddha addresses Maitreya,
                        explaining seven ways in which bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening. He
                        also lists two sets of five qualities that characterize a nonregressing
                        bodhisattva, as well as five that mark an incorrigible, flawed individual on
                        the bodhisattva path. To illustrate the exemplary bodhisattva, the Buddha
                        recounts a past-life memory of the deeds of a great king named Puṇyodgata,
                        who was a devotee of the buddha Śaśiketu.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-005-15"/>
                    <p tid="14">Following this discourse, countless female devotees, led by the
                        queens of King Bimbisāra, promise their service to the Dharma in all
                        subsequent lives. This delights the Buddha, who beams a smile at them. The
                        women, captivated, eloquently enjoin the Buddha to give them a teaching
                        about the causes, qualities, and implications of his smile. In response, the
                        Buddha recounts more past-life memories, this time about the noble deeds of
                        an ancient ruler named Puṇyaraśmi, who was an exemplary guardian of the
                        Dharma. The Buddha also describes the degenerate age, in which the influence
                        of the Dharma will wane. During this time, he explains, it will be
                        especially important for Buddhists to train in the sūtra of <title xml:lang="en">The Absorption of the Thus-Gone One’s Wisdom Seal</title>,
                        and to master the absorption it describes. The Buddha then highlights
                        differences between bodhisattvas based on whether they have aroused the mind
                        of awakening and the roots of virtue in the presence of hundreds, thousands,
                        or millions of buddhas. In short, the latter have the greatest resolve to
                        traverse the path and are least susceptible to any kind of regression.
                        However, they will still suffer. The sūtra explains that whatever negative
                        karma remains for these bodhisattvas will be purified through instances of
                        ordinary human misfortune: they will be criticized, they will suffer bouts
                        of depression, they will be born into dysfunctional families, they will face
                        adverse economic conditions, and so forth. Bodhisattvas of the highest order
                        will bear these pains and persevere on the path; others will falter.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-005-16"/>
                    <p tid="15">Toward the end of the sūtra, the Buddha addresses Mañjuśrī,
                        Maitreya, and an assembly of distinguished disciples who ask him to explain
                        the meaning of the term <distinct>Dharma</distinct> itself. Thus begins a
                        long synonymic chain of significant Buddhist terms: inexhaustible, unborn,
                        uninterrupted, uncollected, ungraspable, nonabiding, and groundless, until
                        the final term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nirvāṇa</foreign>.
                        This list echoes the terms used earlier in the sūtra to describe
                            the <distinct>absorption of the thus-gone one’s
                            wisdom seal</distinct>. Given this definition of the Dharma, the
                        disciples wonder how they should act as its protectors. The Buddha explains
                        that if they indeed realize the meaning of what he has taught them,
                        “ultimately we find nothing at all—no Dharma and no conflict with the
                        Dharma.” Then, with philosophically rich verses he instructs them further on
                        the ultimate truth, beyond concepts and characteristics. The sūtra concludes
                        with another exhortation to the gathered assembly to accomplish
                        the <distinct>absorption of the thus-gone one’s
                            wisdom seal</distinct>.</p>

                        they abided in the absence of wishes, and their conduct was natural. They
                        had attained the retention that accomplishes limitless methods. They had
                        attained acceptance regarding sameness, they had attained sameness, and they
                        had attained unobstructed retention. They knew the higher or lower
