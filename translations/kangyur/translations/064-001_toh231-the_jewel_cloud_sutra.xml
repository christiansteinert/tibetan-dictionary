                <p tid="1">On Gayāśīrṣa Hill, Buddha Śākyamuni is visited by a great gathering of bodhisattvas who have traveled miraculously there from a distant world, to venerate him as one who has vowed to liberate beings in a world much more afflicted than their own. The visiting bodhisattvas are led by Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin, who asks the Buddha a series of searching questions. In response, the Buddha gives a detailed and systematic account of the practices, qualities, and nature of bodhisattvas, the stages of their path, their realization, and their activities. Many of the topics are structured into sets of ten aspects, expounded with reasoned explanations and illustrated with parables and analogies. This sūtra is said to have been one of the very first scriptures translated into Tibetan. Its doctrinal richness, profundity, and clarity are justly celebrated, and some of its key statements on meditation, the realization of emptiness, and the fundamental nature of the mind have been widely quoted in the Indian treatises and Tibetan commentarial literature. </p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Jewel Cloud</title> is a very rich and closely packed
                        Mahāyāna sūtra. Evidence of its authority in India can be found in many
                        philosophical commentaries; for example, it is
                        cited three times in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sūtrasamuccaya</title> (Toh 3934), which is attributed to Nāgārjuna,
                        and repeatedly throughout Śāntideva’s <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Śikṣāsamuccaya</title> (Toh 3940). Citations and references,
                        sometimes at central junctures, are also found in the works of authors such
                        as Bhāviveka (circa 500–78), Candrakīrti (seventh century), Śāntarakṣita
                        (725–88), and Kamalaśīla (eighth century).<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-064-001-4" index="1"> For details

                            In this context, referring almost certainly to the great eighth–ninth century Tibetan translator (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">lo chen</foreign>) Vairotsana. There is another, later Vairocanarakṣita, a twelfth century Indian scholar and yogi who spent his later years in Tibet, introducing there and translating mainly tantric and Mahāmudrā texts. He was not a contemporary of Chönyi Tsultrim and as an Indian would not have been referred to as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">zhu chen lo tsa ba</foreign>.</note> Moreover, whereas the colophons of the
                                Tshalpa group state that the translators “translated, edited, and finalized” the
                                sūtra, the Thempangma witnesses only mention that they “edited,
                                finalized, and revised” the translation. Some ambiguity therefore remains as to whether the translators 
                                were merely editing a preexisting translation according to the new lexicon
                                that was being implemented at the time, or whether they produced an entirely
                                new translation. Given that this was a time when many older translations
                                were revised—and the prominent role Rinchen Tso and Chönyi Tsultrim are said to have
                                played in the revision process, discussed in the two paragraphs below—we concur with Cristina Scherrer-Schaub (2002) that
                                the former hypothesis seems the most likely.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-064-001-12" index="8">

                        have shown how it was most likely
                        a major lexical source for the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāvyutpatti</title>, a ninth century

                        on Gayā­śīrṣa Hill in Gayā, presiding over a great
                        gathering of monks, bodhisattvas, gods, and other nonhuman beings. The Buddha
                        radiates a miraculous light that illuminates the universes in the ten directions. 
                        In an extremely distant universe, the bodhisattva followers of the buddha
                        Padma­netra notice this light. When the great bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin asks
                        his teacher about it, Buddha
                        Padma­netra explains its origins, and Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin is so touched by Buddha
                        Śākyamuni’s compassionate acceptance of the barbaric and ungrateful beings
                        who inhabit that realm that he asks
                        permission to travel there, to see Buddha Śākyamuni and offer him his worship.

                        Gayā­śīrṣa Hill at Gayā. In worship of Śākyamuni, the bodhisattvas
                        emanate an infinite cloud of miraculous offerings. Likewise, to alleviate
                        the suffering of the beings born in the universe within which Śākyamuni
                        resides, the bodhisattvas send forth a vast array of emanated beings and
                        objects. Through these emanations, they heal sentient beings and transform

                        Śākyamuni a long series of questions, all of which are concerned with the
                        nature, qualities, and activities of bodhisattvas. The main part of the
                        sūtra consists of Śākyamuni’s detailed replies to these questions,
                        interspersed with supportive dialogues between Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin and
                        the Buddha. The carefully structured enumeration of subjects is a particular feature of 
                        this sūtra. Starting with the ten perfections, over one hundred topics are 
                        explained in detail, many of them subdivided into groups of ten subtopics, and some 
                        branching out into many more. The sixth of ten topics within a section on how bodhisattvas are 
                        similar to the wind, for example, includes a long series of further lists of the qualities of 
                        bodhisattvas, and then of the qualities of thus-gone ones, 
                        too—all within the analogy of how the activity of bodhisattvas creates a whole “universe” of 
                        positive qualities in the same way that the element wind is instrumental in creating the physical 
                        universe.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-064-001-977" index="13">The section on the element wind

                        in all its ramifications, the predominant theme of Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bin’s questions.
                        Indeed, the Buddha’s replies follow Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin’s initial questions so closely

                        circumambulate the Buddha in homage. Śākyamuni takes the occasion to explain

                        teachings and the Vinaya of the bodhisattvas. The Buddha also offers

                        promises to serve and protect those who commit themselves to its teaching.
                        At Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin’s request, Śākyamuni provides the sūtra with four
                        distinct names. As the great gathering rejoices, the sūtra concludes.</p>

                        a worthy one, a perfect buddha, someone with proper knowledge and conduct, a

                        of, as are the names of their respective vehicles. Everyone in that buddha
                        realm takes birth instantaneously, such that birth from the wombs of females
                        is unheard of. All the sentient beings of that realm are, without exception,
                        bodhisattvas whose progress toward unexcelled and complete awakening is irreversible. In
                        that realm food, drink, and their consumption are all unknown. All the
                        bodhisattvas of that realm partake of the delightful sustenance of
                        concentration, the delightful sustenance of absorption, and the delightful
                        sustenance of the Dharma. The light that shines from that thus-gone one
                        pervades that realm and illuminates it. Apart from that, that world knows of
                        no moonlight or sunlight, <ref cRef="F.4.b"/> nor of any light from planets
                        or stars. The land there is perfectly even, like the palm of a hand, and
                        there are no grasses, trees, rocks, walls, or mountains. </p>

                        desirable, sensible, delightful, and beautiful.’ With conviction in that

                        lesser negativity takes one to the lower realms just as great negativity

                        Desire, anger, and dullness. Desire is threefold, as there is greater,

                        one’s mind remains desirous, giving rise to thoughts of desire. Thus one
                        holds desirous situations to be excellent and the emotion to be a good
                        quality. Absence of shyness, on the other hand, is when the causes,
                        conditions, and bases for desire make it so that even if one’s parents,
                        spiritual teacher, or the like object to, oppose, or criticize this, <ref cRef="F.23.a"/> one feels no shame about one’s desire, and instead,
                        shamelessly, one holds the emotion to be a valuable quality. Thus, by such

                        with flowers, perfumes, and incense. In so doing they dedicate this practice
                        so that sentient beings may be free of the foul smell of their base
                        character and achieve the fragrance of the thus-gone ones’ discipline. When
                        they sweep and repair such sacred objects they dedicate their work so that
                        sentient beings may be free from repulsive behavior and instead take up
                        beautiful and excellent activities. As they offer flower parasols they do so
                        with the dedication that sentient beings may be free from the torments of
                        the primary and subsidiary afflictions. When they enter a temple, they
                        develop the motivation, ‘I shall deliver all beings to the city of the
                        transcendence of suffering.’ When they go outside, they develop the
                        motivation, ‘I shall free all beings from the prison of cyclic existence.’
                        When they open the door to their home they form the motivation, ‘I shall
                        open the doors to the joyful destinations with the wisdom that transcends
                        the world.’ When they close the door, they develop the motivation, ‘I shall
                        close the doors to the lower realms.’ When they rest, they form the wish, ‘I
                        shall place all beings at the seat of awakening.’ <ref cRef="F.28.b"/> When
                        they lie down to sleep on their right side they think, ‘I shall bring all
                        beings beyond suffering by means of the buddhas’ transcendence of
                        suffering.’ As they get up, they develop the motivation, ‘I shall cause all
                        beings to rise above the occurrence of affliction.’ In terms of the body,
                        when they walk, they think, ‘May all beings walk with the gait of a great
                        being.’ When they sit, they do so with the motivation, ‘May all beings be
                        relieved of the pains of desire, anger, and dullness.’ When they take a bath
                        they develop the motivation, ‘I shall wash away all beings’ stains of
                        affliction.’ When they wash their hands they think, ‘I shall clear away the
                        stench of affliction for all beings.’ When they wash their feet their
                        motivation is, ‘I shall wash away all the dust of affliction for all
                        beings.’ As they brush their teeth they think, ‘I shall dispel all the
                        various stains of sentient beings.’ All physical movements they dedicate to
                        the benefit and happiness of all beings. When they prostrate before shrines
                        devoted to the thus-gone ones they think, ‘May all beings of the world,
                        including the gods, come to worship.’<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-064-001-217" index="52"> This passage, from

                        and the nirgranthas. Attempting to mature them, bodhisattvas think, ‘Alas,
                        these beings have been taken by pride. In the past I was unable to train
                        them as their master, so now I shall accept to be their disciple.’ So they
                        take ordination among them. <ref cRef="F.29.a"/> Once ordained, they strive,

                        they end up being venerated as teachers and masters among the non-Buddhists
                        and their words are kept in mind and adhered to. When the bodhisattvas then
                        feel that the non-Buddhists have become close students, they declare,
                        ‘Friends, this is not the path of weariness, freedom from desire, and
                        cessation!’ Having declared the shortcomings of the non-Buddhists,

                        persistence, they accomplish the concentrations, absorptions, and

                        tame such beings is to emanate a fine and lovely girl—the most beautiful

                        before that person and ask, ‘Hey, you, why are you unhappy and depressed?’
                        The reply may be, ‘Noble son, I have committed a deed with immediate
                        consequences, and so I fear that I shall suffer harm for a long time and
                        that for me there will be no fortune, but only suffering.’ Saying this, that
                        person will be unhappy and depressed. Yet the bodhisattva will let that
                        being receive vows and confess their misdeeds. Thereupon the bodhisattva
                        will teach the most profound Dharma. However, if that person does not

                        drop your regrets. <ref cRef="F.30.a"/> I am your friend and I am telling
                        you that no one ever went to hell or became deprived of all success by doing

                        cleared away through wisdom.’ Having said this, the bodhisattva will then
                        sever the life-force of their parents and, as the parents are slain, the
                        bodhisattva will display miracles. At that point the transgressor will
                        think, ‘Since even someone endowed with miraculous powers may slay their
                        parents, then how about someone like me?’ The bodhisattva will then by any
                        means teach that person a Dharma instruction that renders their karma as
                        light as the wings of a bee. Such is the bodhisattvas’ skill in dispelling

                        bodhisattvas will project an emanation as a means for taming that person. If
                        the person is someone who can be trained by a king, they will project a
                        king, but if a great minister must tame that person, then it is a great
                        minister who will be emanated. Likewise, if that person is to be tamed by
                        brahmins, warriors, townspeople, or country dwellers then indeed the
                        relevant type of person will be emanated. For the one who must be trained by
                        gods, a god will be emanated, and to the one who is to be tamed by
                        Vajrapāṇi, the latter will appear. Those who are to be influenced by
                        something frightening will be shown something frightening, whereas those who
                        are to be tamed by beatings, threats, killing, or bondage will be shown just
                        that. The noble will tame those who are to be tamed by the noble. Sentient

                        unknown see sentient beings who are intent on killing others they respond
                        with great compassion and think, ‘Alas, these beings are intent on ruin!
                        Alas, they wish for destruction!’ Seeing this as clearly as amalaki seeds
                        placed in the palm of their hand, they react with great dejection, thinking,
                        ‘For the sake of just a single being I am ready to bear the suffering of the
                        Hell of Incessant Pain until that being enters the field of the
                        transcendence of suffering without any remainder of the aggregates. Now, all

                        Hell of Incessant Pain. And yet there is no means for averting this. These
                        beings have short lives and no faith, and I do not have the power either to
                        carry them to a different place or to subdue them. Therefore, once their

                        Incessant Pain?’ Thus the bodhisattvas feel compassion. With a concern for
                        the misdeeds of those beings as if they were their own, they enfold such
                        beings with love and, if no other method works, they will even use
                        punishment to correct them. Such is the bodhisattvas’ skill in protecting

                        completely fearless. Thus they think, ‘The awakening of the buddhas is

                        Furthermore, they will think, “In the past, when I was practicing
                        bodhisattva activity, I pledged to awaken to buddhahood so that I could lead
                        others to buddhahood as well. Such was my aspiration and it has now been
                        perfected; my pledge has now been fulfilled.” This is what I have heard, and
                        all of it is true. It is reality. In this there is no deception. About these
                        matters I have no doubts or reservations. That which we refer to as
                        awakening is the bodhisattva’s attainment of buddhahood, and when I myself
                        gain that state I will be known as a perfect buddha.’ In this way
                        bodhisattvas trust in awakening and the emergence of the thus-gone ones. </p>

                        Because this Dharma is beyond all words, beyond all statements, beyond the
                        entire domain of language, and beyond any verbal expression. <ref cRef="F.69.a"/> It is free of all constructs, entirely beyond accepting
                        and rejecting, beyond opening and closing. Free of all logic, it is no
                        object of analysis. Not within the purview of logic, it is beyond the scope
                        of logic. This Dharma has no marks. Free of marks, it is beyond the sphere
                        of marks. It is beyond the domain of the childish, the reach of the māras,
                        the domain of affliction, and the domain of consciousness. It is neither a
                        support nor is it supported. Peaceful, this is the domain of the noble ones’
                        wisdom. It is known by oneself. It is stainless, unsullied, pure, sublime,
                        supreme, sacred, outstanding, everlasting, enduring, solid, and

                        this one doctor and no one else. The people there do not know of the
                        doctor’s wonderful abilities, and so the doctor thinks to himself, ‘Alas,
                        these beings are suffering, stricken by disease, but they do not know much
                        about medicine, and so they continue to suffer. I must cure all these

                        cure them.’ As he praises his own qualities in this way, the people come to

                        cure. When they do so, the doctor can heal them. Now, noble son, what do you

                        ligaments, foul smelling, stinking, and repulsive. This recognition puts an

                        their own errors, childish beings believe that there are pleasant feelings.
                        While bewildered children refer to suffering as happiness, noble beings

                        The mind precedes all phenomena, so knowledge of the mind leads to knowledge
                        of all phenomena. The world is drawn by the mind, but the mind does not see

                        clarity and skill. The Blessed One has taught, “With desire comes
                        attachment, and from attachment follows dullness. With dullness one fails to
                        practice in relation to virtuous or unvirtuous qualities, and as a result
                        one will take rebirth in the lower realms.” With that in mind it would also
                        not be right for me to develop any aversion to mental objects and the like.
                        If, failing to be patient and accepting, I should instead become aggressive
                        toward anyone, I would be scorned by noble beings and derided by those who

                        commitments the outlook of bodhisattvas is excellent and hence they become
                        humble and free of pride. Free of pride and with a humble attitude, they go
                        to collect refuse rags of the worst kind, clothes that no one would wear.
                        Finding such rags they wash them, repair them, sew them, and color them. As
                        they do so, they do not tire of, or become weary of, their garments. When
                        there is such freedom from weariness, the clothes can be used well and yet
                        no one will feel any attachment to them. <ref cRef="F.84.b"/> The
                        bodhisattvas who wear such clothes will not perceive any flaws in them, for
                        they will not think, ‘Alas, my refuse rags have been torn! Alas, my refuse
                        rags are sagging! Alas, my refuse rags are infested with lice! My refuse
                        rags are uncomfortable and make me sweat!’ Bodhisattvas instead perceive
                        excellent qualities in such rags, thinking, ‘Such refuse rags have been worn
                        by the sages. They support the severance from desires, befit noble beings,
                        and are commended by the thus-gone ones, praised by the thus-gone ones.’
                        Thus, due to such causes, conditions, and bases, they will neither praise
                        themselves nor blame others. Without praising themselves or blaming others,
                        their discipline is excellent. By means of their excellent discipline they
                        will gather the gods and receive the praise of the thus-gone ones. They will
                        be cherished by bodhisattvas and protected by human and nonhuman beings.
                        They will receive the homage of brahmins, nobility, townspeople, and country
                        dwellers, and be extolled by all who keep pure conduct. Noble son,

                        elder monks. To the younger monks they should show their appreciation and,
                        in their presence, remain standing. They should not sit on any of the seats
                        that are designated for the saṅgha. Noble son, why is that? Because a
                        bodhisattva should have consideration for the mindset of mundane people, and
                        a charnel ground-dwelling bodhisattva is in disharmony with worldly people
                        who are not noble. On the other hand, they are certainly not in disharmony
                        with noble beings. So charnel ground-dwelling bodhisattvas understand that
                        if they adapt themselves to others’ seats, they themselves will be free of
                        any regrets and no one will blame them. Hence, they will first find out the

                        echo, like an illusion, transient, fluctuating, and dependently originating.
                        Thus they think, ‘These phenomena are deceptive, hollow, insubstantial, like

                        fluctuating, and dependently originating. And yet they appear to arise, and
                        they appear to remain and cease.’ So they wonder, ‘What are the conditions
                        for their arising, and what are the conditions for their ceasing?’ They will
                        then think, ‘These phenomena arise due to the condition of ignorance; they
                        emerge from ignorance, are preceded by ignorance, and they are dependent on
                        ignorance. Based on ignorance, formations manifest, and based on formations,
                        consciousness is present. If there is consciousness, there will be the
                        imputation of name and form, and if things are imputed in terms of name and
                        form, so will they be imputed in terms of the six sense sources. With the
                        presence of the sense sources there will be contact, and if there is contact
                        there will be the appearance of feeling. Due to the causal factors of
                        feeling, craving will affect childish beings, and when upset by craving
                        there will be appropriation. Engagement in appropriation leads to a new
                        existence, and if there is a new existence, there is birth. With birth comes
                        old age, and an aged person will die. In death there is pain, lamentation,
                        despair, and anxiety. <ref cRef="F.100.a"/> Thus arises this mass of nothing

                        cessation. As ignorance ceases, so will all the phenomena that arise due to
                        the condition of ignorance, that emerge from ignorance, that are preceded by
                        ignorance, and that are dependent on ignorance. </p>

                        from physical pretense? When bodhisattvas see a donor or a benefactor, they
                        will not try to improve their conduct. How so? They will not suddenly walk
                        slowly, keeping their vision within the range of a yoke, and maintain an air
                        of weariness and freedom from obscuration. Thus they avoid physical
                        pretense. <ref cRef="F.103.a"/> How do they avoid verbal pretense?

                        they avoid verbal pretense. How, then, do they avoid mental pretense? When a
                        donor or a benefactor is offering things, bodhisattvas will not pretend to
                        have few desires while their minds are avaricious. Noble son, speaking as if
                        one were content while actually being avaricious is a form of inner torment,
                        and bodhisattvas do not engage in such pretense. Thus, bodhisattvas are free
                        from acquiring things through pretense and flattery. </p>

                        ‘I shall shine! I shall benefit sentient beings!’ Still, due to the

                        having to apply themselves, and without having to create anything. In what

                        all means become able to bring forth emanations nonconceptually.’ Thus such

                        facing the Blessed One, they said, “Blessed One, when we brought an end to
                        the great cycle of births it was also through hearing of this intrinsic

                        and given, that location is to be seen as the seat of awakening, and the
                        event is to be understood as the turning of the wheel of Dharma. This
                        teaching should be regarded as a great shrine, and you should think, ‘Herein
                        resides our Teacher.’ And why, noble sons? Because its intrinsic nature is
                        awakening. Its intrinsic nature is the turning of the wheel of Dharma. Noble
                        sons, the thus-gone ones are the Dharma body; so, noble sons, by worshiping
                        the Dharma you worship the thus-gone ones. </p>

                        joy, faith, and delight. Respectfully, one should prepare a seat for that
                        Dharma teacher, offer praise, and frequently express one’s approval of the

                        praise are not important to them. Noble sons, even if, yearning for this
