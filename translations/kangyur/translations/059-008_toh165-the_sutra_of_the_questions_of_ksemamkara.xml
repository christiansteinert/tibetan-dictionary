                    question he poses about the qualities of bodhisattvas and how to develop such
                    qualities. The Buddha teaches him about the bodhisattvas’ qualities, first in
                    prose and later reiterated in verse, and then equates the teaching of
                    this sūtra with the perfection of insight, stating that even if one practices
                    the first five perfections for many eons, one will not make much progress
                    without knowing what is taught in this sūtra.</p>

                    <p tid="9">The setting of this short sūtra, <title xml:lang="en">The Question
                            of Kṣemaṅkara</title>, is the Nyagrodha Park near Kapilavastu, the city
                        in the ancient Śākya kingdom that contained the family home where Prince
                        Siddhārtha grew up. It is assumed to be some ten kilometers to the west of
                        his birthplace, Lumbini, in present-day Nepal. The sūtra describes a
                        conversation between Buddha Śākyamuni and the Śākya youth Kṣemaṅkara, who
                        asks the Buddha a lengthy question about the qualities good bodhisattvas
                        should have and how to develop such qualities. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-059-008-5"/>
                    <p tid="10">The Buddha’s response unfolds as a teaching on how to practice the
                        bodhisattva path—an uncomplicated instruction given to a layperson. The
                        teaching is without the specialized vocabulary of Buddhist philosophy and
                        does not place strong emphasis on monastic discipline, although it does
                        admonish against involvement with women. For the modern reader it should be
                        kept in mind that such comments regarding women are primarily meant for men
                        as advice in support of celibacy.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-059-008-6"/>
                    <p tid="11">In this teaching the Buddha offers Kṣemaṅkara a set of ethical
                        instructions, such as not retaliating when attacked, combined with teachings aimed
                        at liberation, such as how to realize emptiness in order to successfully
                        complete the bodhisattva path. Delighted by the Buddha’s response,
                        Kṣemaṅkara makes an offering of his jewelry. The Buddha transforms the
                        jewelry into a multitude of magically created beings, who in turn become the
                        basis for a further teaching on the illusory character of phenomena. Unlike many longer sūtras,
                            <title xml:lang="en">The Questions of Kṣemaṅkara</title> does not
                        develop an elaborate storyline, nor are we given much information regarding
                        the setting or the characters. Instead, this is a brief teaching that
                        responds to a simple question. The only other participant in the
                        conversation is Ānanda, in his usual role as witness to the Buddha’s
                        teaching.</p>

                    <p tid="12">Near the end of the sūtra, the evil Māra also makes an appearance
                        and inquires about the benefit of the Buddha’s discourse. The Buddha then
                        equates the teaching of this sūtra with the perfection of insight, stating
                        that no matter how long one practices the first five perfections, unless one
                        knows this teaching, one will be unable to make much progress on the
                        bodhisattva path. </p>

                    <p tid="13">Unfortunately, no Sanskrit version of this sūtra remains extant, but
                        the text was translated into both Chinese and Tibetan. The Chinese
                        translation (T 533) was produced by the prolific translator Chih-ch’ien
                        (third century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>) sometime between 223–53 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. As such this sūtra can be dated to the
                        formative period of India’s Mahāyāna scriptural tradition.</p>

                    <p tid="14">In producing this translation, we have based our work on the Degé
                        xylograph while consulting the Comparative Edition (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe bsdur ma</title>), as well as the Stok Palace manuscript. The
                        colophon of the sūtra states that it was translated from Sanskrit by the
                        Indian scholar Prajñāvarman and the prolific Tibetan translator Yeshé Dé. As
                        such, we can date the Tibetan translation to the late eighth to early ninth
                        centuries, a dating that is also attested by the text’s inclusion in the

                        together with a great saṅgha of five hundred monks. At that time a Śākya

                        the Blessed One and asked him, “Blessed One, what qualities should
