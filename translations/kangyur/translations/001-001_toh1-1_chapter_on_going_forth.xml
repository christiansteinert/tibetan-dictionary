                    life in a Buddhist monastic community. This first chapter traces the development of the rite by which
                    postulants were admitted into the monastic order, from Buddha Śākyamuni’s informal invitation to “Come, join
                    me,” to the more elaborate “Present Day Rite.” Along the way, the posts of preceptor and instructor are
                    introduced, their responsibilities defined, and a dichotomy between reliable monks and immature novices
                    described. While the heart of the chapter is a transcript of the “Present Day Rite,” the text is interwoven
                    with numerous narrative asides, depicting the spiritual ferment of the north Indian region of Magadha during
                    the Buddha’s lifetime, the follies of untrained and unsupervised apprentices, and the need for a formal system
                    of tutelage.</p>

                        learning and assured of bright futures. In time Upatiṣya proves himself to be a brilliant interpreter of
                        the Vedas, while Kolita, a talented teacher in his own right, is expected to succeed his father as royal
                        priest to the King of Rājagṛha. Though each hears of the other’s reputation from their young brahmin
                        students, they do not meet until the feast of the nāga kings Giri and Valguka, where they recognize one
                        another as kindred spirits. After securing their parents’ consent, they forego their given destinies and
                        set off in search of a renunciant order to join.</p>

                            the present chapter. Claus Vogel (1970) has published a translation and study of the account from the
                            present chapter, while Graeme MacQueen (1978) has published a translation and study of seven surviving

                        who, they are told, has “withdrawn into seclusion.” Duly impressed, they are won over and join his order
                        upon hearing his philosophy—that “the Dharma is truth and non-violence; the peaceful, ageless, immortal,
                        and unwaning state is Brahman.” Before long, however, Sañjayin passes away and the two move on, bringing

                        permission to join his order. With the words, “Come, join me, monks. Live the holy life,” the Buddha
                        admitted them into his order and ordained them monks. This simple invitation is known as the “Come, join

                        petition the saṅgha three times, after which an officiant monk would move that the saṅgha <term type="ignore">act</term> on the petition. By remaining silent, the saṅgha signaled its assent, and the

                        them, the new rite solved a logistical problem but did nothing to address an equally, if not more, pressing
                        problem: helping new members establish themselves in a new code of conduct and a new way of life.
                        Consequently, some new monks had no sense of decorum and were poorly behaved. Local brahmins and
                        householders even complained of being harassed by them. The new monks would come to town to beg alms,
                        disheveled and improperly dressed, speaking shrilly in loud voices, behaving wildly, and demanding they
                        be fed. </p>

                        take action. Such gross neglect of one’s brethren was too much and the saṅgha petitioned the Buddha to
                        intervene. After some consideration, the Buddha created the positions of preceptor and instructor and
                        charged the monks in those roles with the responsibility of ordaining and instructing new monks. </p>

                        postulants, and so again they petitioned the Buddha. This time, the Buddha prescribed a longer and more
                        formal rite of admission and ordination, with stricter acceptance criteria and a novel division of the
                        community into lay devotees, novices, and monks. This rite pertains to the present day and is known in the

                    <p tid="53">One of the difficulties in translating vinaya texts lies in finding appropriate English
                        equivalents for the language of Buddhist monasticism. In several instances we have borrowed terms from
                        Christianity such as “ordination” and “monk,” even though they may only bear a superficial similarity to
                        their Buddhist analogs.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-001-001-78" index="39"> Consider our use of the
                            word “ordination,” for instance. In Catholicism, one “professes” to become a monk and is “ordained” to
                            become a priest. While a monk may become a priest, the two are distinct vocations, the latter being a
                            clerical office with specific rights and responsibilities not shared by unordained monks. Since the
                            Buddhist tradition does not distinguish between monastic and clerical offices, it is misleading and
                            perhaps even incorrect to translate the Tibetan <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">bsnyen par

                            “ordination.” However, as we have not yet come upon a satisfactory translation for this term, we have
                            decided to follow established precedent. We are indebted to Wulstan Fletcher for his advice on this
                            term. </note> Another difficulty lies in the historical fact that the language of Buddhist
                        renunciation was adapted from a body of terms and ideas common among Greater Magadhan ascetic communities

                            Banerjee’s <title xml:lang="en">Sarvāvastivāda Literature</title>, Kalyāṇamitra gives this text the
                            title <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">lung gzhi’i ’grel pa</title> or <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Āgamavastuvṛtti</title> in the colophon (Martin, 2011: *Śubhamitra). None of the Degé, Choné,
                            Kangxi, or Narthang editions of this commentary include a colophon; all of them end abruptly after
                            thirteen fascicles. In the commentary itself, however, Kalyāṇamitra refers to his work numerous times
                            as the <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’dul ba gzhi rgya cher ’grel ba</title> and identifies himself as the

                            Kalyāṇamitra”) at the end of his remarks on the second chapter. The lack of a colophon prevents us
                            from identifying the Tibetan translators who executed the translation and the Indian paṇḍitas who
                            oversaw it.</note> On the whole, Kalyāṇamitra’s citations mirror the relevant passages from the root
                        text. However, there is enough variation between the root text and his commentary—direct quotations
                        purportedly from the root text which have no correlate in any of the Tibetan redactions, important
                        passages of the root text not glossed in the commentary, differences in key terms—to suggest Kalyāṇamitra
                        may have been working from a different edition of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title> than
                        that which was available to the Tibetan translators and their Indian informants.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-001-001-99" index="51"> Such variance, common when texts are transmitted in manuscript
                            form, becomes less common with the adoption of block printing. Recent work by scholars such as Shayne
                            Clarke, Chistopher Emms, and Haiyan Hu-von Hinüber also points to the existence of multiple
                            Mūlasarvāstivādin transmissions, though the nature and extent of their differences is not yet clear.
                            That said, the Tibetan translations of Kalyāṇamitra’s commentary and the <title xml:lang="en">Chapter

                        the Tibetan translation of Kalyāṇamitra’s commentary appears to be incomplete. Presumably, Kalyāṇamitra
                        commented on all seventeen chapters of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title>, but the Degé,
                        Coné, and Narthang editions of his commentary all end abruptly after the thirteenth fascicle, four pages
                        into his comments on the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title>’s third chapter, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Pravāraṇāvastu</title>.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-001-001-100" index="52">
                            The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title> itself takes up nearly 2,500 pages over four volumes
                            but, since the extant Tibetan translations of Kalyāṇamitra’s <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastuṭīkā</title> are incomplete, it is not clear how long his commentary was in the
                            Sanskrit original. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastuṭīkā</title> begins with a detailed,
                            word-by-word commentary on the first chapter that is as long as the chapter itself, 261 pages. By
                            contrast, the commentary on the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title>’s 180-page second chapter
                            takes only 32 pages. Despite its brevity, Kalyāṇamitra’s commentary to the second chapter is consistent
                            with the material, the structure and terms of which are more straightforward and less diverse than the
                            first chapter. Kalyāṇamitra may have treated the other fifteen chapters as extensively as he did the
                            first chapter or as cursorily as he did the second; given the available material, it is impossible to
                            say more.</note>

                        they do not change, nor do they harm one another, nor do they become merit, nor do they become sin, nor do
                        they become both merit and sin, nor do they become pleasure, nor do they become pain, nor do they become

                            lives, presage death, and know the exhaustion of defilements. The higher trainings are in ethics,
                            attention, and wisdom. Buddhas discipline in ways that are unequivocally gentle, unequivocally harsh,
                            and both gentle and harsh. Buddhas have crossed the rivers of desire, existence, view, and ignorance.
                            Buddhas are well-grounded in samādhis “powered by” aspiration, diligence, attention, and analysis.
                            Buddhas attract disciples through generosity, speaking pleasantly, consistency in action, and acting
                            altruistically. Buddhas have no fear in proclaiming that they have achieved perfect buddhahood,
                            exhausted defilements, teach the path of renunciation, and teach precisely what constitutes an
                            obstacle to that path and realization. Buddhas have abandoned five “branches” or factors that
                            perpetuate saṃsāra: pursuing desires, ill will, lethargy and languor, regret and agitation, and view
                            and doubt. Buddhas have transcended rebirth as a god, human, hell-realm being, animal, and spirit.
                            Buddhas are in possession of six “branches” of knowledge: knowledge of miraculous realms, the divine
                            ear, different states of mind, previous rebirths, birth and death, and the exhaustion of defilements.
                            To always abide by the six abodes means to always be aware of and attentive to the six objects of
                            visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and mental consciousness. The flower of awakening’s
                            seven branches are mindfulness, discernment, diligence, joy, pliancy, samādhi, and equanimity
                            (Kalyāṇamitra, F.217.b.6–218.b.2). Dungkar Rinpoche gives two similar lists of the seven treasures of
                            a noble being: (1) faith, ethics, generosity, learning, samaya, a conscience, and wisdom, and (2)
                            faith, ethics, learning, generosity, a conscience, propriety, and wisdom (dung dkar, 2002, 1370–1371).
                            In his <title xml:lang="en">Gateway to Knowledge</title>, Mipham identifies three groups of three
                            thoughts that inspire aggression: (1–3) “the thoughts, ‘This has hurt me. This is hurting me. This
                            will hurt me.’; (4–6) the thoughts, ‘This has hurt someone dear to me. This is hurting someone dear to
                            me. This will hurt someone dear to me.’; and (7–9) the thoughts, ‘This has helped my enemy. This helps
                            my enemy. This will help my enemy’.” (Mi pham rgya mtsho, 1978, 74). The eight branches of the path
                            are right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
                            mindfulness, and right concentration. The nine stages of absorption are the four dhyānas, the four
                            formless-realm absorptions, and absorption in cessation. Kalyāṇamitra gives a list of nine strengths:
                            the strengths of knowing right from wrong; knowing one’s karma is one’s own doing; absorption in
                            concentration, liberation, and samādhi; knowing supreme faculties from those that are not; knowing the
                            range of dispositions; knowing the paths on which all tread; knowing and recollecting past rebirths;
                            knowing birth and death; and knowing the exhaustion of defilements (Kalyāṇamitra, F.218.b.2–218.b.6).
                            To these, one can add the tenth from a list given by Kawa Paltsek in his <title xml:lang="en">A
                                Mnemonic for Dharma Lists</title>, which follows Kalyāṇamitra’s in most other regards: The

                                only accepted them because they were the only people left who had not yet converted (Kalyāṇamitra,
                                F.223.b.5). The verse in the original seems less directed at those monks in particular and more
                                expressive of a sense of general bereavement and grievance directed towards the Buddha himself,

                            According to the commentary, Dīrghanakha argued that the self does not endure beyond this life because

                            cannot see it because objects of perception must be “right in front of us,” which a future self,
                            separated in time and space, cannot be. Nor can inference see it because objects of inference must be
                            abstractions, not “things” like the self. The Buddha’s response suggests that Dīrghanakha’s view is
                            nihilistic, for it holds that the self begins at birth and ends at death, thereby denying continuity
                            from life to life (Kalyāṇamitra, F.224.a.4–6).</note>

                            Offenses are of two types, those involving forfeiture and simple offenses. Offenses entailing
                            forfeiture are expunged through communal confession and the forfeiting of the object that caused the

                            Transgressions requiring personal confession are expunged through personal confession while faults are
                            expunged through resolving to refrain from them in the future (see Dudjom, 1999). According to
                            Kalyāṇamitra, slight mental faults must be reined in; offenses, transgressions requiring personal
                            confession, and confessable faults should be confessed; while transgressions requiring saṅgha
                            intervention and offenses entailing forfeiture must be formally excused (Kalyāṇamitra, F.244.a.4–7).

                            they may place him on probation. If the monk incurs the same lapse again before the end of his
                            demotion or probation, a repeat demotion or probation may be imposed. And if the monk lapses again

                            imposed. During these times, the monk is obliged to perform certain menial tasks and observe a
                            “special discipline,” which entails adopting a position of deference and rejecting honors accorded to
                            observant or “sound” monks. At the successful completion of a demotion or probation, the monk can then

                            sentence imposed on his preceptor or instructor. The nature of his plea in this paragraph is somewhat
                            unclear. The wording in all Tibetan recensions is identical (Pedurma,
                            152). In this case, the ward or apprentice does not appeal for total clemency but only for the
                            imposition of a demotion, suggesting that the preceptor or instructor in question faces probation or worse.
                            The ward or apprentice’s plea thus amounts to a plea for a reduced sentence, as below.</note>

                            described above. Until that time, they were obliged to live as wards of, or apprentices to, a
                            “reliable instructor.” To oversee wards and apprentices, a monk must himself be “reliable” (Tib.

If
                            a monk observes his vows purely, he may receive, and use, extensive patronage, as much as “one hundred
                            thousand items of clothing, one hundred thousand dishes of food, and five hundred houses,” provided he
                            receives it with “the thought of nirvaṇa” (Kalyāṇamitra, F.296.b.6–7). However, if he is lax in his
                            observance of his ethics, he is not entitled to patronage and the consequences of seeking it are dire.
                            As the Buddha said in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavibhaṅga</title>, “For one without pure vows
                            and whose ethics are lax, / It is far better / To eat fiery iron balls / Than alms collected from

                        there, who then proceeded to evict us. Those of us who could not bear this piled wood, straw, and dried
                        dung and set fire to the monastery, burning many of the monks intent on training there. As the fruition of

                        ordination is to be judged valid, for it is difficult for a person to find monkhood, to go forth and be
                        ordained in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya. The same conditions apply to suspensions meted out for
                        refusing to amend one’s behavior, and suspensions meted out for refusing to give up deviant views.” <ref cRef="F.130.a" type="folio"/>

                        wont, the group of six kept as wards anyone whose going forth had been allowed and who had been ordained,
                        but who could not recognize a rogue. Once the wards could recognize a rogue, they were entrusted as wards
                        to sound monks. On the advice of the Teacher, they would on occasion simply look in on their wards. </p>

                                in severity, there are thirteen transgressions requiring <term type="ignore">transgression whose
                                    remnant is restored by the saṅgha</term>. Transgressions of the monastic vows are classed as
                                either atonable (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">sāvaśeṣa</foreign>; Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">lhag bcas</foreign>) or unatonable (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">nirvaśeṣa</foreign>; Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">lhag med</foreign>). Unatonable
                                transgressions, such as defeats, entail loss of one’s monk- or nunhood while atonable
                                transgressions can be atoned for in prescribed ways, according to the severity of the offense.
                                When a monk incurs a <term type="ignore">transgression whose remnant is restored by the
                                    saṅgha</term>, the saṅgha imposes a demotion or probation during which the monk must endure a
                                loss of status and privilege and give regular reports on his conduct. Upon completion of this
                                period of penance, the saṅgha may then reinstate the monk with full honors and privileges. There
                                is no consensus on the exact referent of the Sanskrit term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vaśeṣa</foreign> or its Tibetan translation <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">lhag ma</foreign>,

                                subject to the “law of the land.” The Buddhist saṅgha enjoyed such autonomy. The analogy means the
                                king granted sovereignty to the saṅgha, which was then allowed to govern itself and was not
                                subject to the law of the land. The legal exemption members of the saṅgha enjoyed made it an
                                attractive sanctuary for those on the run from their masters, debt collectors, and the law, who
                                would join the saṅgha for legal rather than spiritual reasons. “From ancient times the legal
                                tradition recognized the right of properly constituted groups to formulate their own laws”

                                monk is one who has passed ten years as a monk and possesses five qualities and is thus fit to
                                guide new monks, grant ordination, and instruction. In “The Chapter on Going Forth,” the Buddha
                                says a monk who has been ordained five years may be considered “<term type="ignore">reliable</term>” enough to travel without a reliable instructor between monsoons. Though the
                                text does not address the issue, a monk of five years ordination would not, in ordinary
                                circumstances, serve as a reliable instructor.</term>

                                outside Rajagṛha that had been donated to him. The name is said to have arisen when,

                                Grove. While the king rested, his consort wandered off. A snake (the reincarnation of the
                                park’s previous owner, who still resented the king’s acquisition of the park) approached with
                                malign intentions. Through the king’s tremendous merit, a gathering 
                                of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kalandaka</foreign>—crows or other birds according to Tibetan renderings,

                                began squawking. Their clamor alerted the king’s consort to the danger, who rushed back and hacked
                                the snake to pieces, thereby saving the king’s life. King Bimbisāra then named the spot
