                <p tid="1">While the Buddha is residing in the Realm of the Thirty-Three Gods with a retinue of deities, great
                    hearers, and bodhisattvas, Avalokiteśvara asks the Buddha how beings can gain merit from building a stūpa. The
                    Buddha responds by stating the Buddhist creed on dependent arising: </p>
                  <lg tid="2">
                    <l>All phenomena that arise from causes, </l>
                    <l>The Tathāgata has taught their cause,</l>
                    <l>And that which is their cessation, </l>
                    <l>Thus has proclaimed the Great Renunciant.</l>
                </lg>
                <p tid="3">The Buddha then explains that this dependent arising is the dharmakāya, and that whoever sees dependent
                    arising sees the Buddha. He concludes the sūtra by saying that one should place these verses inside stūpas to
                    attain the merit of Brahmā.</p>

                    <p tid="6">The topic of this sūtra, as is evident from its title, is the Buddhist doctrine of the dependent
                        arising of conditioned phenomena. This concept is considered by many Buddhists to be the essence of the
                        teaching, the Dharma. Dependent arising is often presented as a series of twelve links (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nidāna</foreign>) of causes and effects that begins with ignorance and
                        ends with death. This schema is found in many canonical texts, and is the principal topic of the two works
                        that precede the present sūtra in the Degé Kangyur,

                    <p tid="7">The teaching on dependent arising is epitomized by the famous “creed” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dhāraṇī</foreign>) in verse-form, stating that the Buddha teaches the causes for the arising of
                        phenomena as well as that which is their cessation. This verse formula is perhaps best known from a
                        narrative in the Vinaya recounting Śāriputra’s life. The story tells of Upatiṣya (as Śāriputra was called
                        before he met the Buddha) first hearing about the Buddha from Aśvajit, one of the Buddha’s five erstwhile
                        companions and earliest disciples. When Upatiṣya asks Aśvajit to summarize the very essence of the
                        Buddha’s teaching, Aśvajit answers him by reciting this verse. As soon as he hears it, Upatiṣya
                        immediately attains a preliminary state of realization.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-062-012-63" index="2"> In the Mūlasarvāstivāda-vinaya, the story is told in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Pravrajya­vastu</title>, the first chapter of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinaya­vastu</title> (Toh 1-1), Degé Kangyur vol. 1 (’dul ba, ka), folios 32b <foreign xml:lang="la">et seq.</foreign>.

                            </ref>. In the Pāli Canon,
                            the same story is told in the Vinayapiṭaka (Mahāvagga I.23.1-10). See also Oldenberg (1997, pp 39-41).

                    <p tid="8">In the sūtra translated here, however, these same lines are taught to Avalokiteśvara by the Buddha
                            himself.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-062-012-64" index="3">It would nevertheless seem
                            significant, in view of the story mentioned in the previous paragraph, that this sūtra makes specific
                            mention of Aśvajit, his name (unusually) being the only individual one used to represent the group of
                            hearer disciples in the assembly.</note> The Buddha then instructs his followers to insert them into
                        stūpas in order to generate the merit of Brahmā, an extraordinary type of merit.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-062-012-65" index="4"> For a detailed study of the use of the concept of the merit of
                            Brahmā in Buddhist inscriptions and textual sources, see Salomon and Schopen (1984). This article also
                            includes a partial translation of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Pratītya­samutpāda­sūtra</title> (see p
                            117). </note> The practice of inserting these verses, as well as impressing or inscribing them on
                        religious images, appears to have become popular during the second half of the first millennium,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-062-012-66" index="5">See Boucher (1991), p 1.</note> and was observed by

                            this “creed” has been discovered and the linguistic variations found among them. </note> This practice
                        was continued by the Tibetans into the second millennium and to this day it is considered by Buddhists to
                        be a meritorious act.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-062-012-69" index="8"> Bentor mentions that

                        type of relic of the Buddha from the time of early Mahāyāna discourse, according to which worshipping the
                        words of the Buddha was considered to be equivalent, if not superior, to worshipping the Buddha
