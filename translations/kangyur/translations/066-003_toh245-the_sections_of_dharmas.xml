                    <p tid="7">The title of the sūtra refers to the sections of teachings given by the
                        Buddha, which are traditionally said to number 84,000. The sūtra begins with
                        an inquiry by Śāriputra about the nature and number of the sections of the
                        Dharma, to which the Buddha answers with a teaching on the absence of birth
                        with regard to phenomena—a teaching that serves as an antidote to the poison
                        of desire. The beginning of the sūtra thus situates the text explicitly in a
                        Mahāyāna context as it introduces the notion that phenomena do not appear or
                        cease. Indeed, in the manner of the teachings of the second turning,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-003-7" index="3"> According to later Indian (and even later,
                            Tibetan) doxography that first finds clear expression in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra</title>, the Dharma taught
                            by the Buddha can be classified into three distinct doctrinal groupings
                            called the <distinct>three wheels of doctrine</distinct>. According to
                            this schema, the second wheel focuses primarily on the emptiness of
                            phenomena. </note> the text deconstructs the reality and identity of
                        objects of desire, thereby demonstrating that desires are mere fantasies
                        based on imaginary objects and are not to be indulged in by the wise. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-066-003-8"/>
                    <p tid="8">This second-turning introduction to the problem of desire however leads to an
                        extensive discussion of a topic that, due to its emphasis on the elimination
                        of desire as such, would generally be considered a first-turning
                            teaching;<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-003-9" index="4"> The first turning refers mainly to
                            the four noble truths, as well as teachings on the five aggregates.
                            Mahāyāna exegetes considered these to be teachings of the hearers, and
                            therefore classified them as teachings of provisional, as opposed to
                            definitive, meaning. See Powers (2013), p. 103. </note> namely, the
                        repulsiveness of the human body—and the female body, in particular. In its
                        presentation of the female constitution, the sūtra in fact disparages women
                        in a way that most modern readers would find offensive—José Cabezón has
                        aptly described the sūtra as “one of the most misogynistic texts in the
                        Buddhist canon.”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-003-10" index="5">Cabezón (2017), p. 125, no.
                            328.</note> Nonetheless, recent research has shown that the repulsive
                        nature of the female body was in fact a common theme in early Mahāyāna
                        texts. In their studies of texts dating to the beginning of the common era,
                        Ulrich Pagel (1995), Jan Nattier (2003), and Daniel Boucher (2008) have
                        argued that one major strand of early Mahāyāna involved male monastics eager
                        to engage in demanding ascetic practices. The deprecatory descriptions of
                        the repulsiveness of women’s bodies that form the main argument of <title xml:lang="en">The Sections of Dharma</title> might have served to
                        support such efforts of male monastics to attain the ideal of renunciation.
                        In this respect, Boucher and Nattier have noted how women were often
                        deprecated and represented as an obstacle to men’s practice in some early
                        Mahāyāna texts, and this very much accords with the tone of our sūtra.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-003-11" index="6"> Boucher (2008), pp. 50–52; Nattier (2003), pp.
                            96–100.</note> In fact, according to these scholars, early Mahāyāna
                        might even have seen a decrease in the participation of women in Buddhist
                        institutions, contrary to a popular modern understanding of the Mahāyāna as
                        a more egalitarian movement than the mainstream tradition.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-003-12" index="7">Nattier (2003), p. 98. </note> Nevertheless, although this
                        sūtra does in many ways seem to support this analysis, toward the end of the
                        sūtra the Buddha twice describes the intended audience as the four-fold
                        assembly of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. As such, the sūtra itself
                        professes to benefit not only male monastics with its message of the
                        repulsiveness of the human (and, in particular, the female) body, but really
                        anyone, whether male or female, ordained or lay. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-066-003-13"/>
                    <p tid="9">In spite of such calls for a broad audience, this approach is likely to have
                        resonated most clearly with male monastics, as it represents a Buddhist
                        perspective that runs right from the institutional androcentrism of early
                        monastic Buddhism to the valorization of ascetic discipline in the early
                            Mahāyāna.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-003-14" index="8"> Boucher (2008), pp. 51–52. </note>
                        The common theme between our text and those studied by Boucher and Nattier
                        suggests that we might also locate this sūtra among the earlier strata of
                        Mahāyāna sūtras that emerged in the first centuries <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. An interesting difference between these texts, however, is
                            <title xml:lang="en">The Sections of Dharma</title>’s explicit usage of
                            <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prajñāpāramitā</foreign> themes
                        in its discussion of such concepts as the absence of birth and cessation
                        with regard to phenomena; such themes are absent from the texts studied by
                        Boucher and Nattier. <title xml:lang="en">The Sections of Dharma</title>
                        therefore seems to belong to a different stream of early Mahāyāna texts, one
                        still centered on monastics, rather than lay bodhisattvas, yet
                        simultaneously inspired by <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prajñāpāramitā</foreign> themes. This thematic duality is also
                        reflected in the fact that the early imperial catalogues categorized this
                        scripture as a Mahāyāna sūtra, yet the translation colophon in the Stok
                        Palace Kangyur notes that it belongs to the first turning of the wheel of
                        Dharma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">bka’ ’khor lo dang por gtogs

                        sūtra is still very much set in the hearers’ monastic context, exemplified
                        by the fact that the Buddha teaches in the presence of worthy ones (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">arhants</foreign>), and not
                        bodhisattvas. The sūtra’s concluding verse, which states that the Buddha did
                        not expound this teaching to spiritual practitioners, but only to those who
                        still indulged in desires, moreover suggests that the main body of the text
                        is a teaching of provisional meaning, which is meant for beginners on the
                        path and later to be superseded by more advanced teachings. Teachings of
                        provisional meaning are contextual and adapted to the spiritual capacities
                        of their audience. As such, since they do not literally expound the ultimate
                        view, they require interpretation. </p>

                    <p tid="10">One additional theme brought up by this sūtra deserves to be mentioned here.
                        The modern reader may indeed be surprised by several passages describing how
                        various physical and mental ailments that afflict women are caused by
                            <emph>parasites</emph> (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">srin
                            bu</foreign>, Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">krimi/kṛmi</foreign>) that subsist in different parts of their bodies.
                        According to this sūtra, such parasites are responsible for a host of
                        (mostly undesirable) physical traits in the female physique. For example,
                        some such parasites are said to live in the urinary tracts of women, where
                        they find nourishment by eating away at their host. The parasites are
                        described to cause women to become mentally disturbed, thus making them
                        engage in uninhibited sexual activity. Other parasites are said to gnaw away
                        at women’s brains, noses, throats, etc. The sūtra apparently describes the
                        presence of these parasites in the female body to account for the unique
                        physical traits that women possess, such as their absence of facial hair,
                        bulging breasts, and smooth throats. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-066-003-16"/>
                    <p tid="11">Although the particular descriptions of the parasites that live in the female
                        body may be unique to this sūtra, the belief that parasites are the cause of
                        various unpleasant physical conditions was already a well-established theory
                        in Indian medical literature at the time of composition of this text. This
                        notion, which perhaps developed from the observation of worms in decomposing
                        corpses, was already present in the earliest Indic scripture dealing with
                        cures and healing, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Atharvaveda</title>, which
                        was composed sometime between 1200–1000 <hi rend="small-caps">bce</hi> and
                        offers descriptions of various parasites, or, technically,
                            <emph>worms</emph> (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">krimi</foreign>) that invade the human body.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-003-17" index="9">Zysk (1993), p. 64.</note> Moreover, Jain and Kāmaśāstra literature,
                        which are closer in temporal proximity to our sūtra, both include theories
                        of vaginal worms—in the Jain texts these are said to be killed through
                        sexual intercourse, thus making sex an inherently nonvirtuous act; and in
                        the Kāmaśāstra literature they are described as the cause of a woman’s
                            <emph>itch</emph> of sexual desire.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-003-18" index="10">Thanks
                            to José Cabezón for bringing this to our attention. See further Cabezón
                            (2017), p. 125, no. 328.</note> As such, the sūtra offers a presentation
                        of the female physique that draws from a theory of parasites that must have
                        been aligned with commonly accepted notions of the human constitution in
                        India at that time. It should also be noted that this presentation is in
                        some ways reminiscent of the radical early Buddhist practice of
                        contemplating the stages of decomposition of corpses that Buddhist ascetics
                        were familiar with. That practice is well described in Buddhaghoṣa’s <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Visuddhimagga</title> (ch. 6.88), for example, and may
                        have been current in Mahāyāna circles as well, as this sūtra suggests.
                        Buddhaghoṣa’s closing statements on this practice in fact parallel the
                        approach and aim of this sūtra when he addresses men’s unfounded lust for
                        women’s bodies; he writes “… a living body is just as foul as a dead one,
                        only the characteristic of foulness is not evident in a living body, being
                        hidden by adventitious embellishments.”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-003-19" index="11">Cited

                        the Nyagrodha Park, together with a great saṅgha of five hundred monks. At
                        one point venerable Śāriputra, venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana, venerable
                        Mahākāśyapa, venerable Ānanda, and venerable Rāhula all went to see the
                        Blessed One, prostrated to him, placing their heads at his feet, and sat to
                        one side. Sitting there, venerable Śāriputra asked the Blessed One: <ref cRef="F.28.a"/> “Blessed One, you have spoken of sections of the Dharma.
                        But what is the extent of those sections of the Dharma that the Thus-Gone
                        One refers to with that expression? How many such sections are there? What
                        are the sections of the Dharma?”</p>

                    <p tid="20">The Blessed One replied to venerable Śāriputra: “Śāriputra, the Thus-Gone One
                        has taught that there are 84,000 sections of the Dharma. Śāriputra, in this
                        regard, the birthlessness of all phenomena is the primary sense of a section
                        of the Dharma. Śāriputra, I do not claim that there is something called
                        phenomena, or that anything whatsoever is born or ceases. Why is that?
                        Śāriputra, it is because all phenomena are characterized as being unborn and
                        unceasing. For example, Śāriputra, paṇḍakas<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-003-27" index="13">Tib.

                            cover the full semantic range of the original Sanskrit. Given that we
                            are here in the context of someone who cannot be identified as either a
                            man or a woman, the meaning could perhaps in this context be
                                <emph>neuter</emph>. It seems, however, that in other contexts the
                            term may have a broader range of meaning, or even a somewhat different
                            meaning. Engle (2009, p. 437, note 562) explains the term to refer to a
                            man or a woman who has a functioning but somehow deficient sexual
                            faculty, such as someone who only experiences arousal

                        not be said to be men or women. Why is that? Śāriputra, it is because they
                        cannot be designated as men or women. Likewise, Śāriputra, the Thus-Gone One
                        has attained unsurpassed awakening with respect to all phenomena, but one
                        cannot say that he knows phenomena on account of phenomena. </p>

                        are never satisfied by indulging in their desires. Consequently, knowing
                        that women have such great faults, the Thus-Gone One added additional rules
