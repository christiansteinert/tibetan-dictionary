                  <title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra of the Wheel of Dharma</title> contains one of the most well-known teachings of
                  Buddhism: the four truths of the noble ones. These four truths are: (1) the truth of suffering, (2) the truth of
                  the origin of suffering, (3) the truth of the cessation of suffering, and (4) the truth of the path leading to
                  the cessation of suffering. According to traditional accounts, this is the first teaching taught by the Buddha
                  following his attainment of awakening. The Buddha is said to have journeyed from the seat of awakening in
                  Bodhgaya to the Deer Park outside Varanasi, where he delivered this teaching to his five former spiritual
                  companions. Since this was the first time the Buddha turned the wheel of Dharma, this discourse also became
                  known as <title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra of the Wheel of Dharma</title>, or, more commonly, <title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra of the Turning of the Wheel of Dharma</title>. </p>
               <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-072-037-4"/>
               <p tid="4">Although very brief, this classical presentation of the four truths has remained central to the Buddhist
                  tradition since its very early days. As such, this teaching is included in all the major canons of Buddhism, so
                  that versions in Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan are found.<note place="end" index="1" xml:id="UT22084-072-037-84"> For a summary of the Pali, Sanskrit, and Chinese sources of this teaching, see
                     Anderson 1999, p. 15-16. See also Bronkhorst 1993, p. 80, n. 200.</note> As far as translations into Tibetan
                  are concerned, we find the classical presentation of the four truths embedded in no fewer than five individual
                  works in the Kangyur. Of these, the following three contain accounts of this first teaching in passages that are
                  clearly closely related, being almost verbatim identical:<note place="end" index="2" xml:id="UT22084-072-037-85">Although the precise historical relationship between these three texts has not been fully confirmed, it is
                     highly likely that Toh 1 is the source, from which Toh 301 is an extract relating the Buddha’s life as a
                     whole (naturally including this episode), while Toh 337 is a very short extract of this episode alone.

                        the Kangyur that were translated into Tibetan from the Pali. As such it mirrors closely the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Dhamma­chakkappavattana­sutta</title> of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṃyuttanikāya</title>, although some differences exist.<note place="end" index="5" xml:id="UT22084-072-037-88">This text is found in the Degé Kangyur, vol. 34 (shes phyin, ka), folios
                           180b.1-183a.6, in the section of “Thirteen Late Translated Texts.” This group of works is traditionally
                           placed in the Perfection of Wisdom section but is not, in fact, related to that genre. The texts were
                           translated from Pali in the fourteenth century at the monastery of Tharpa Ling by a Sri Lankan monk,
                           Ānandaśrī, and the Tibetan translator Nyima Gyaltsen Pel Zangpo. According to Skilling (1993, p. 97),
                           this was during the first decade of the fourteenth century; Skilling has compared this particular text
                           against the extant Pali <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Dhamma­chakkappavattana­sutta</title> (1993, pp. 103-106),
                           and concludes that the Tibetan follows the Pali version but contains some significant omissions that he
                           attributes to an erroneous manuscript or translation errors.</note>

                        similarities with the other texts, yet clearly belongs to another manuscript tradition as there are a
                        number of significant differences as well. Here the teaching is found in the penultimate chapter (ch. 26),

                  significant—that set them apart from the rest. These differences have been studied in great detail over the last
                  two centuries and a rich body of scholarship on the philological and theoretical aspects of this teaching has
                     emerged.<note place="end" index="7" xml:id="UT22084-072-037-90"> For a summary of modern scholarship on the

                  truths as we today find it included in the various canons is the product of several editorial revisions over the
                  centuries. As such, the “original” version of this teaching remains elusive, as does the role played by this
                  teaching in the earliest days of the Buddhist tradition.<note place="end" index="8" xml:id="UT22084-072-037-91">

                     479-480, and Kloppenborg 1973, pp. 24-27.</note> have been produced. The translation presented here has been
                  made on the basis of the Tibetan translation of <title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra of the Wheel of Dharma</title>
                  (Toh 337). As mentioned above, this text is with minor exceptions identical to the corresponding sections in Toh
                  1 and Toh 331. Toh 337 contains no mention of the translators, but the translator of Toh 1 is listed as the
                  Tibetan Kawa Paltseg (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ka ba dpal brtsegs</foreign>), who was a prolific translator
                  during the early period of Tibetan translations, which took place at the beginning of the ninth century.
                  Unfortunately, the Sanskrit version that formed the basis for Kawa Paltseg’s translation of Toh 1 is no longer
                  extant. The Sanskrit manuscript of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṅgha­bheda­vastu</title> that is available to us today (Gnoli 1977) has enough differences
                  from the Tibetan translation for us to conclude that it was not the text that was used to produce the Tibetan
                  translation. Nevertheless, it does represent an important witness of the Sanskrit, and our translation
                  benefitted greatly from comparing it with the Tibetan. Our main sources were the Degé prints of Toh
                  1, Toh 301, and Toh 337, taking into account the variants noted in the Pedurma comparative edition of each.</p>
