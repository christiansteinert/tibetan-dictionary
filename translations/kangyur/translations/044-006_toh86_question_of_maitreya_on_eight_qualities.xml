                        completing the whole path to buddhahood. The Buddha responds with a list of eight qualities that, while
                        individually all standard elements of the Mahāyāna path, as a set of eight appear to be
                        specific to this text. The Buddha briefly explains each quality and, in his explanation of the last—the
                        perfection of wisdom—outlines the doctrine of the twelve links of dependent origination in both their
                        “forward” and “reverse” orders, corresponding to causation and cessation. </p>

                        closely linked—in both, Maitreya questions the Buddha about the bodhisattvas’ qualities. However, their
                        geographic settings differ: <title xml:lang="en">The Question of Maitreya on the Eight Qualities</title>
                        takes place on Vulture Peak Mountain near Rājagṛha, like many other Ratnakūṭa sūtras, while <title xml:lang="en">The Question of Maitreya</title> is delivered in
                        a relatively obscure location, Mount Śuśumāra in the country of the Bhargas. </p>

                        of early translations, dated to a year of the dragon thought to be most likely 824 (but possibly 812), so
                        they must have been translated by that date. The translation of this one, the shorter sūtra, is attributed
                        to Jinamitra and Danaśila, and Yeshé Dé is said to have corrected it using the revised terminology
                            (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">skad gsar</foreign>). Since <title xml:lang="en">The Question

                        Jinamitra and Surendrabodhi, under the editorial supervision of Yeshé Dé, may have been slightly later. </p>

                    <p tid="9">In the Degé Kangyur, the text has two different titles: the first, in the initial line introducing
                        it as the forty-second section of the Ratnakūṭa, calls it “The Noble Elucidation of the Question of Maitreya on
                        the Eight Qualities” (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’phags pa byams pas chos brgyad zhus pa lung bstan
                            pa</title>), while the second, immediately afterwards, is simply “The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra of the
                        Question of Maitreya” (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’phags pa byams pas zhus pa zhes bya ba theg pa chen po’i
                            mdo</title>), which is the same as the title of the preceding text. The Sanskrit titles of both
                        sūtras, as transliterated in Tibetan in the Degé Kangyur, are also the same: <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Maitreya­paripṛcchā</title>. In other Kangyurs, a variety of similar titles are given, while in
                        some—e.g. the Narthang (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">snar thang</title>) and Stok Palace Manuscript (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">stog pho brang bris ma</title>) Kangyurs—the Sanskrit title includes mention of the
                        eight qualities: <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Maitreya­paripṛcchā­dharmāṣṭa</title>. Whether the reference to
                        the “eight qualities” figured in the title of the Sanskrit original or, if not, at what stage it was
                        integrated into the title as a convenient way of distinguishing this text from the preceding one, is
                        difficult to determine. In the Tibetan title, at least, inclusion of the eight qualities was a feature in
                        some Kangyurs and text catalogues early in the imperial period, even if it was not universal. It is found
                        (as <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’phags pa byams pas zhus pa’i chos brgyad pa</title>) in the early ninth
                        century Denkarma inventory mentioned above. </p>

                        together with a great saṅgha of 1,250 monks and 10,000 bodhisattvas. The Blessed One, surrounded by a

                    <p tid="14">At that time, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya was present among that very retinue. He rose
                        from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, set his right knee on the ground, and paid
                        homage with palms joined toward the Blessed One. He then said to the Blessed One, “Would the Blessed One
                        please, if he has time, answer a certain question that I would like to put to the Tathāgata, the Arhat,
                        the perfectly enlightened Buddha?” </p>
                    <p tid="15">The Blessed One <ref cRef="F.117.a"/> answered the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, “Maitreya, you
                        may put to the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha whatever question you wish. What I
