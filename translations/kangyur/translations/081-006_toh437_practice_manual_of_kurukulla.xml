                    <title xml:lang="en">The Practice Manual of Noble Tārā Kurukullā</title> is the most comprehensive single work
                    on the female Buddhist deity Kurukullā. It is also the only canonical scripture to focus on this deity. The
                    text’s importance is therefore commensurate with the importance of the goddess herself, who is the chief
                    Buddhist deity of magnetizing, in particular the magnetizing which takes the form of enthrallment.</p>
                <p tid="2">The text is a treasury of ritual practices connected with enthrallment and similar magical
                    acts—practices which range from formal sādhana to traditional homa ritual, and to magical methods involving
                    herbs, minerals, etc. The text’s varied contents are presented as a multi-layered blend of the apotropaic and
                    the soteriological, as well as the practical and the philosophical, where these complementary opposites
                    combine together into a genuinely spiritual Buddhist work.</p>

                    <p tid="6">The very foundation of all Buddhist paths is the recognition of the unsatisfactory nature of
                            <distinct>saṃsāra</distinct>, the cycle of conditioned existence, and the quest for liberation from
                        it. Building upon that basis, the Great Vehicle holds that <distinct>saṃsāra</distinct> and
                            <distinct>nirvāṇa</distinct> are indeed inseparable and that the goal of all practice must be the
                        liberation from suffering, not only of oneself, but of all other beings. It is a debated point as to
                        whether tantra has its own unique view. Where there is unanimity, however, is that the path of the tantras
                        adds a panoply of methods that enable the practitioner to achieve the goal of the Great Vehicle swiftly
                        and effectively.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-081-006-4"/>
                    <p tid="7">The tantras are concerned principally with the stages of “deity yoga.” With the guidance of a
                        skilled teacher and after suitable preliminary training and empowerment, the practitioner is introduced
                        to, and subsequently trains in recognizing, the divine nature of the world and its inhabitants. This is
                        symbolically centered on the generation of the deity as the embodiment of enlightenment in one of its many
                        aspects—a depiction in terms of form, sound, and imagination of the very goal to which the practitioner
                        aspires. Through various modes of such practice, which differ according to the different levels of tantra,
                        the practitioner is able to recognize, access, and actualize his or her own innately enlightened
                        nature.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-081-006-5"/>
                    <p tid="8">The female deity Kurukullā, whose practice is the subject-matter of this text, has a particular
                        place and orientation amid the pantheon of meditational deities. Like all deities, she is a
                        personification of buddhahood in its entirety. As a female deity, she is understood to embody the wisdom
                        aspect of enlightenment (i.e., emptiness), and as a form of the savioress Tārā, herself a manifestation of
                        Avalokiteśvara, she personifies all-embracing compassion. But her particular quality is related to the
                        “activity” of enlightenment. Many Great Vehicle scriptures describe the spontaneous and effortless
                        activity of buddhas for the benefit of beings. In Vajrayāna that enlightened activity is spoken of in
                        terms of four modes, or types, of activity: pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and destroying. It is the
                        third of these, magnetizing, that is the special field of Kurukullā, and it is to deploy that particular
                        quality of enlightenment that a practitioner would undertake her practice.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-081-006-6"/>
                    <p tid="9">While there are as many as thirty-seven Kurukullā sādhana liturgies included in the Tengyur, and
                        many more in the indigenous Tibetan literature, the text translated here is the only work in the Kangyur
                        that focuses on Kurukullā. Rather than being a systematic presentation of one form of practice, it takes
                        the form of a compendium of varied elements—ranging from formal sādhanas to traditional fire offering
                        ritual, and to magical recipes and methods involving herbs, minerals, and other ingredients—from which a
                        practitioner might draw in order to constitute a range of Kurukullā-centered practices. The text’s varied
                        contents are presented as a multi-layered blend of the apotropaic and the soteriological, as well as the
                        practical and the philosophical.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-081-006-7"/>
                    <p tid="10">The text’s pattern of contents is in keeping with the term <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kalpa</foreign> figuring in the title. An ancient meaning, already found in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ṛgveda</title>, of the word <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kalpa</foreign>,
                        is “sacred rule” or “precept,” applying, in particular, to ritual procedures. As such, the scriptures that
                        carry this term in their title are mostly ritual compendia or manuals of ritual practice. With the
                        emergence of Vajrayāna a number of these works appeared, such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mañjuśrī­mūla­kalpa</title>, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kurukullā­kalpa</title>, and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vajra­vārāhī­kalpa</title>. As these titles might then suggest, they are ritual
                        compendia for their specific deities.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-081-006-8"/>
                    <p tid="11">The word <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kalpa</foreign> derives from the root <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kḷp</foreign>, which means “to prepare” or “to arrange.” This meaning is
                        also reflected in the contents of the works that belong to this genre—they are primarily concerned with
                        the technicalities of the ritual rather than with philosophical debate about the principles involved. This
                        is, however, not to say that the latter is altogether absent. Genre-wise, <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kalpas</foreign> are closely related to tantras, inasmuch as they are divinely
                        revealed by the Buddha or one of the great bodhisattvas, such as Avalokiteśvara or Vajrapāṇi. Moreover,
                        both <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kalpas</foreign> and <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">tantras</foreign> are concerned with a particular deity, or set of deities, and aim to guide the
                        practitioner in the rituals and practices related to that deity.</p>

                        chapters, whereas the Sanskrit has essentially the same content structured into eight. Chapter One begins
                        with the statement of its authenticity, and for this, the text declares that it is a direct literary
                        descendant of the <title xml:lang="en">Tantra of the Arising of Tārā</title> (<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Tārodbhava</title>). These Kurukullā teachings, as found in our text, were given by Lord
                        Avalokiteśvara on the Potala mountain, in response to a plea by a female audience consisting of different
                        classes of semi-divine beings. Responding to their request, Avalokiteśvara begins to explain Kurukullā
                        worship and its requisites, which include the drawing of the deity’s image (Kurukullā in her four-armed,
                        seated form), the eighteen-fold pūjā, the mantra and the gathering offering. The main three benefits of
                        this practice are the ability to enthrall beings, to increase wisdom, and to remove poison.</p>

                    <p tid="13">These benefits all have a spiritual dimension if the practitioner possesses a bodhisattva
                        attitude: with loving kindness he or she will be able to control wild animals, with compassion
                        practitioners will deliver the entire world from pain, and by becoming identical with Tārā-Kurukullā, they
                        will be able to provide assistance to beings in need. The practice of compassionate virtue is the key to
                        this success.</p>

                    <p tid="14">In Chapter Two there follows a description of the sādhana of the wish-fulfilling tree, through
                        which one makes offerings to the buddhas and provides sentient beings with all that they need. This
                        sādhana of the wish-fulfilling tree is followed by the main sādhana of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kurukullākalpa</title>. It is introduced by the statement that the mind is the sole “reality,” and
                        because this is so, the key to attaining buddhahood is the cleansing of the mirror of mind. The means by
                        which to accomplish this cleansing is this very sādhana. As it follows the formal structure of a typical
                        yoginītantra sādhana with its prayers, worship, visualizations, etc., it is unnecessary to recount here
                        all the traditional details.</p>

                    <p tid="15">After summoning the “wisdom being,” one requests an empowerment, and along with the empowerment
                        one is given the injunctions regarding the follow-up practice. The sign of success is that the lotus-mudrā
                        formed with one’s hands at the end of the six-month practice period will burst into flames. By proceeding
                        as described, the practitioner will attain the three enlightened bodies and will thereby be able to enact
                        the great deeds of the Buddha.</p>

                    <p tid="16">At this point in the text, there is an interruption in the description of the empowerment and of
                        the samaya-pledges (which are resumed much later in the text), and we have instead a discourse, given by
                        Vajrapāṇi, on the three enlightened bodies, followed by a Nāgārjuna-style exposition of the doctrine of
                        emptiness. When asked how the mudrās, mantras, maṇḍalas and siddhis should be interpreted in the context
                        of emptiness, Varjapāṇi explains that they too are part of the chain of dependent origination—i.e., that
                        the accomplishments are achieved in dependence on the mudrās, the mantras and so forth.</p>

                    <p tid="17">Chapter Three begins with a section containing various methods and related information on the main
                        types of Kurukullā activity—enthralling, increasing wisdom, and removing poison, with discussion of the
                        deeper spiritual implications of these three acts. We are told what materials should be used as mālā beads
                        for these three types of activity, and are given specific instructions on the lighting of sacrificial
                        fires (the shape of the fire pit, the type of firewood, etc.) and on the substances used as offerings.
                        Some methods further described involve medicinal plants and other materials. The teacher also points out
                        the more profound purposes: by enthralling beings with the mind of loving kindness one can establish all
                        of them in enlightenment, by increasing intelligence one can attain the perfection of wisdom and achieve
                        liberation, and by removing poison one brings peace to the world.</p>

                    <p tid="18">Further, we are given instructions on the method of visualizing the syllable <mantra type="syllable" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">hrīḥ</mantra> (the seed syllable of Kurukullā) on different parts of
                        the body and told the benefits arising from that: if it is on the clitoris, then enthrallment will follow;
                        if on the chest, wisdom will increase; if between the teeth, one will remove poison. Connections are
                        explained between the removal of faults of the body, speech and mind, and the acts of enthrallment,
                        removing poison, and increasing wisdom, respectively. There is also a connection between removing poison
                        (in the spiritual sense) and increasing wisdom. When the poison of ignorance is neutralized, desire is
                        pure wisdom. It is explained that the goddess Pāṇḍarā (implicitly identified with Kurukullā) is, in
                        essence, desire. Her non-dual passion is, however, completely free from poison and thus none other than
                        wisdom.</p>

                        practices, mostly for bringing results other than the main three outcomes specified above. These include:
                        a yantra for warding off snakes, amulets for enthrallment and protection, rituals for bringing wealth with
                        the help of drawings or a cowrie shell (the latter is also said to help one obtain a kingdom or even win
                        at dice).</p>

                        includes the description of the Kurukullā maṇḍala and the divination wherein a flower is tossed into the
                        maṇḍala. After the divination, the initiand is told to observe secrecy regarding his practice and is given
                        the samaya injunctions. The practitioner is instructed to rely on red substances, abstain from non-virtue,
                        accomplish all the qualities associated with the perfections, and respect and pay homage to all women.</p>

                        jars of “the arrow,” “the bow,” “fearlessness,” and “the lotus.” An offering maṇḍala is described, with
                        eight pitchers containing precious substances, along with a “pitcher of victory.” The disciple, suitably
                        attired, is ushered into the maṇḍala and taught a secret method to control the nāgas. The Kurukullā
                        dhāraṇī is now given—a lengthy formula aimed at bringing rain and prosperity. Further methods involving
                        interaction with nāgas are also described—for stopping excessive rain, for curing leprosy and snakebites,
                        and also for magically summoning and enthralling nāga women.</p>

                        are accounts of situations that prompted the Buddha to give the Kurukullā teachings. The first story is
                        about the Buddha’s son, Rāhula, who, while being “pulled” (i.e., subjected to a particular kind of magic)
                        by a nāga, recites the Kurukullā mantra and is miraculously transported into the Buddha’s presence.
                        Witnessing thus the power of Kurukullā’s mantra, he requests from the Buddha the Kurukullā teachings.</p>

                        ill-tempered demoness Hārītī, neglects his duty to protect the teachings. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kurukullākalpa</title> is then taught to help Hārītī enthrall Mahākāla, and in this way, mend things
                        between these two unhappy lovers. As this is successfully accomplished, great happiness ensues.</p>

                        in response, Buddha teaches the boy the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kurukullākalpa</title>. As a result,

                        may be expected, is meant to bring the accomplishments of sky-travel and longevity. Here we find
                        instructions on: 1) producing a mercury preparation which will enable the alchemist to fly through the sky
                        as well as give him the power to enthrall women, 2) producing silver using a specially processed mercury
                        (this is meant to lead, eventually, to the ultimate benefit for oneself and others), and 3) attaining the
                        accomplishment of longevity by employing special plant-preparations.</p>

                    <p tid="26">The last part of Chapter Five describes the magical use of herbs and other substances (in
                        combination with the Kurukullā mantra), as well as amulets, yantras, and other practices, which may be
                        described as magical. Some of these means include: an ointment protecting one from wild elephants; a
                        paste, which, when smeared on shoes, will enable the wearer to walk on water; an incense for the
                        well-being of monks; an ointment to stop children from vomiting breast-milk; inscribed amulets affording
                        protection and bringing good fortune; an amulet to be worn on one’s forearm to bring wealth; an alms-bowl
                        inscribed with the Kurukullā mantra which enables the owner to procure alms in a place where they are
                        difficult to obtain; various methods of enthrallment; a method preventing miscarriage; methods ensuring
                        easy childbirth; remedies for breast diseases; practices meant to prevent premature greying of the hair; a
                        paste meant to help women secrete vaginal lubrication (for pleasurable love-making); a remedy for
                        premature ejaculation; a method for putting out a fire by sprinkling it with wine; and enthrallment
                        methods involving yantra. Other wished-for results include: obtaining a fine son, healing different types
                        of fever, curing eye diseases, overcoming impotence and finding buried treasures. Finally, the closing
                        passages of the chapter once more ground the text and its teaching in the compassion of Avalokiteśvara,
                        and beyond him in the infinite activity of the buddhas throughout space and time. </p>

                        Inside the bow, one should draw a jewel-shaped lotus-bud. In the center of the lotus-bud is the syllable

                        types of jewels, one should take it down. Having washed and worshipped it, one should recite the mantra
                        one hundred and eight times. Within a year, one will become the equal of Kubera. Such a charm should be

                        one should place it in the palm of the hand and recite the mantra one hundred thousand times. If one plays
