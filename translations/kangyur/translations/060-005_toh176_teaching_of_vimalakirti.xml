                <p tid="1">While the Buddha is teaching outside the city of Vaiśālī, a notable householder in the city—the great
                    bodhisattva Vimalakīrti—apparently falls sick. The Buddha asks his disciple and bodhisattva disciples to call
                    on Vimalakīrti, but each of them relates previous encounters that have rendered them reluctant to face his
                    penetrating scrutiny of their attitudes and activities. Only Mañjuśrī has the courage to pay him a visit, and
                    in the conversations that ensue between Vimalakīrti, Mañjuśrī, and several other interlocutors, Vimalakīrti
                    sets out an uncompromising and profound view of the Buddha’s teaching and the bodhisattva path, illustrated by
                    various miraculous displays. Its masterful narrative structure, dramatic and sometimes humorous dialogue, and
                    highly evolved presentation of teachings have made this sūtra one of the favorites of Mahāyāna literature.

                <p tid="7">I earnestly thank Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche for his great efforts in creating the 84000: Translating

                <p tid="8">I also thank John Canti, of 84000, for his careful, creative, and very learned translating and
                    editorial work on this electronic edition, without which this improved translation would not have
                    materialized. I thank Mr. Patrick Alexander, of the Penn State University Press, who was the one who informed
                    me that the copyright to my original translation done for the Institute for Advanced Studies of World
                    Religions had reverted to me upon the termination of that Institute, to which I had previously conveyed my
                    rights.</p>
                <p tid="9">I intend to publish in print form a further update of that original version at a future time. Since
                    there have been a number of free-floating electronic forms of this text on the internet for some years now, I
                    am happy that the sūtra in its current revision is now available in the 84000 Reading Room, among the many
                    other translations on that site. </p>

                    <p tid="12">I elaborate upon this traditional metaphor here to convey a sense of how the <title xml:lang="en">Vimalakīrti</title> is truly unique among Buddhist sūtras. Unmatched in its content—a quintessence of

                        aesthetic virtue, too, makes it an object of the connoisseur’s delight. This helps us understand how a
                        hundred generations of Mahāyāna Buddhists in India, Central Asia, China, Japan, and South East Asia were
                        disposed to study, revere, and enjoy this sūtra, finding <term type="ignore">enlightenment</term>,
                        inspiration, and the <term type="ignore">grace</term> of pleasant humor.</p>

                    <p tid="13">The sūtra starts with the Buddha, in the presence of a large assembly of monks and bodhisattvas
                        gathered before him in Āmrapālī’s grove outside Vaiśālī, receiving offerings from five hundred youths from
                        the city, headed by the Licchavi bodhisattva Ratnākara, and in response revealing the entire universe as a
                        vast buddhafield in a miraculous display, seen by all present. After pronouncing a notable praise to the
                        Buddha in verse, Ratnakāra asks him to explain what is meant by a bodhisattva purifying his buddhafield.
                        The Buddha’s response to this request, together with further descriptions in the fifth, ninth, tenth, and
                        eleventh chapters, constitute one of the most complete and profound teachings on the subject of
                        buddhafields to be found in the canonical literature. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-060-005-28"/>
                    <p tid="14">The second chapter introduces the great Licchavi bodhisattva Vimalakīrti, master of the liberative
                        art, who lives as a layman but transcends all categorization. Manifesting himself as if sick, he teaches
                        all the notables and citizens of Vaiśālī, as they come to inquire about his health, on the insubstantial
                        and unsatisfactory nature of the ordinary body, and compares it to the body of a tathāgata. In the third
                        chapter, the Buddha asks his principal disciples, one by one, to visit Vimalakīrti on his sickbed. All of
                        them in turn, however—first the great disciples, and then the bodhisattvas—feel reluctant to do so and
                        decline on the grounds that previous encounters with him (recounted in detail) have left them astonished
                        and somewhat discomfited by the profundity and transcendent nature of his views, often on topics or
                        practices of which they had themselves hitherto been considered peerless masters. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-060-005-29"/>
                    <p tid="15">Mañjuśrī, despite his own reluctance, is the only bodhisattva to assent to the Buddha’s request,
                        and the fourth and subsequent chapters describe the conversations between him, Vimalakīrti, and a number
                        of other interlocutors from the large assembly accompanying Mañjuśrī to Vimalakīrt’s house in the eager
                        anticipation of hearing the Dharma expressed in the exchange between these two high-level bodhisattvas.
                        Their discussion starts with what is meant by sickness, how a bodhisattva should comfort another
                        bodhisattva who is sick, and how a sick bodhisattva should control his own mind, with most of the dialogue
                        consisting of long passages spoken by Vimalakīrti in response to brief questions by Mañjuśrī. In the fifth
                        chapter, Vimalakīrti performs the miraculous feat of bringing to his house in Vaiśālī millions of enormous
                        thrones belonging to the entourage of a buddha from another, vastly distant universe, the Tathāgata
                        Meru­pradīpa­rāja, and explains how such apparently impossible transformations of time, space, and other
                        phenomena become possible for a bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation. In the sixth
                        chapter—after a discussion with Mañjuśrī on sentient beings and compassion—he leaves it to a goddess
                        living in his house to demonstrate graphically to the hapless great disciple Śāriputra the dualistic
                        notions he holds on attainment, vehicle, and even gender. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-060-005-30"/>
                    <p tid="16">The seventh chapter opens with Vimalakīrti answering Mañjuśrī’s leading questions to explain that
                        whatever ways a bodhisattva might follow, including those conventionally considered the most negative and
                        harmful, will cause him to attain the qualities of the buddhas. This leads to a discussion on the family
                        of the tathāgatas (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">tathāgatagotra</foreign>) and a long speech in
                        verse by Vimalakīrti extolling the ways in which the actions of bodhisattvas correspond to worldly
                        activities, but transcend and surpass them by far. All of this is made possible by bodhisattvas’ freedom

                        present about how each of them practices non-duality, receiving thirty-one different replies all of which
                        Mañjuśrī finds laudable, but nevertheless still tinged with dualism. He requests Vimalakīrti to add his
                        own point of view, to which Vimalakīrti’s responds with his famous silence.</p>

                    <p tid="17">Śāriputra again becomes an object of mind-opening critique when, at the opening of the ninth
                        chapter, Vimalakīrti catches him wondering how everyone present is going to eat before noon. Vimalakīrti
                        miraculously makes everyone perceive another distant buddhafield, where the Tathāgata Gandhottama­kūṭa and
                        his bodhisattvas are about to take their meal. Vimalakīrti emanates a bodhisattva, a messenger who goes to
                        that buddhafield and invites all the bodhisattvas there back to the house in Vaiśālī, bringing a vessel of
                        their miraculous, highly fragrant food for the assembly to enjoy. Vimalakīrti elicits from the visiting
                        bodhisattvas an account of how Gandhottama­kūṭa teaches the Dharma only through perfumes, and explains to
                        them how the Buddha Śākyamuni has to use much grosser expedients to tame the wild and difficult beings of
                        his own buddhafield, the Sahā world. The visitors are surprised and impressed by the Buddha’s compassion.
                        They express the wish to pay him their respects and Vimalakīrti, in the tenth chapter, magically
                        transports the entire assembly, including the visiting bodhisattvas, into the Buddha’s presence in
                        Āmrapālī’s grove so that they may do so. A discussion between the Buddha, Vimalakīrti, and Ānanda of the
                        great variety of methods used to express the Dharma in different buddhafields ensues, and the Buddha gives
                        the visitors, before they depart for their own buddhafield, a long teaching on “the destructible and
                        indestructible,” explaining how bodhisattvas should neither destroy what is compounded nor rest in what is
                        uncompounded.</p>

                    <p tid="18">In the penultimate chapter, prompted by the Buddha, Vimalakīrti describes how he sees the
                        Tathāgata. When Śāriputra asks where Vimalakīrti was before manifesting in this world, the Buddha tells
                        him it was in Abhirati, the buddhafield of Akṣobhya. Everyone present wants a glimpse of that buddhafield,
                        so at the Buddha’s request Vimalakīrti physically miniaturizes Abhirati, brings it to Vaiśālī to show and
                        inspire them all, and then replaces it where it was. In a dialogue with Śakra in the final chapter the
                        Buddha explains, as in many other sūtras, the extraordinary merit of studying and understanding this
                        teaching, and recounts how in one of his own former lives he was taught the importance of Dharma-worship
                        by the Tahāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja. He then entrusts his own enlightenment along with this sūtra to Maitreya,
                        explaining the importance it will have in conveying the profound principles of the Dharma to beings in the
                        future, as well as asking Ānanda to memorize it and giving it several different names. </p>

                    <p tid="19">In keeping with an alternative title of the sūtra (<title xml:lang="en">Inconceivable
                        Liberation</title>),<note place="end" index="1" xml:id="UT22084-060-005-1078">Skt. <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">acintyavimokṣa</title>. See <ptr target="#chapter-12">Chapter 12</ptr>.</note> Vimalakīrti lays great emphasis
                        on the theme of inconceivability, that is, the ultimate incomprehensibility of all things, relative or
                        absolute. He thus spells out the furthest implication of the application of voidness: that the finite,
                        ego-centered mind cannot even conceive of the ultimate nature of things and, hence, as far as such minds
                        are concerned, their ultimate reality is itself inconceivability. This accords with the degree of
                        attainment of the bodhisattva, so frequently reached by Vimalakīrti’s audiences, called “the tolerance of
                        the birthlessness of all things” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">anutpattika­dharma­kṣānti</foreign>). It is extremely significant that the term “tolerance” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kṣānti</foreign>) is used here, rather than “conviction,” “understanding,” or
                        “realization”; it emphasizes the fact that where the ultimate is concerned, the mind is unable to grasp
                        anything in the pattern of dualistic knowledge, for there is no finite object in this case and only
                        relative objects can be grasped with relative certainty in the mundane sense. Yet that is not to say that
                        the student’s task is to simply put a label of “inconceivability” on all things and rest complacent with a
                        sense of having reached a high state. Indeed, there are three stages of this tolerance: the verbal
                            (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ghoṣānugā</foreign>), conforming (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">anulomikī</foreign>), and true tolerance of the birthlessness of things. This
                        indicates the difficulty of attainment of true tolerance, which occurs only at the eighth stage of
                            bodhisattvahood.<note place="end" index="2" xml:id="UT22084-060-005-1079"> See Lamotte (Appendice,

                        to the mind, just like the verbal concept of voidness, or even of infinity.</p>

                        being ultimate because any limit serves as the near boundary of the next larger space or dimension or
                        time. If we adhere rigorously to this process, we soon find ourselves lost in the stars, as it were, with
                        less and less security about ever having started from anywhere. </p>

                        himself rarely spelled it out explicitly, restricting himself to providing the means whereby the
                        disciplined <term type="ignore">intellect</term> can strip away its own conceptualizations and habitual
                        notions. But Vimalakīrti felt that such a message should be available to a much larger circle of people,
                        for he expressed himself definitively on all occasions, as recorded in this sūtra.</p>

                    <p tid="22">The main technique Vimalakīrti uses that is of interest here—dichotomy—is found in his discourse,
                        which relates to another alternative title of the sūtra, “Reconciliation of Dichotomies” (<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Yamaka­puṭa­vyatyasta­nihāra</title>).<note place="end" index="3" xml:id="UT22084-060-005-865"> See Lamotte’s discussion of this concept (Lamotte, Introduction, pp
                            33-37), even though he emphasizes the rhetorical meaning more than the behavioral meaning.</note> This
                        is in keeping with the traditional method of the Middle Way masters, who had great skill in pitting polar
                        opposites against each other to eliminate the fixedness of each and to free the mind of the student who
                        applies himself to the polarities to open into a middle ground of reality beyond concepts. The mahāsiddhas
                        of first-millennium India refined this art to a consummate degree in their songs and extraordinary deeds,
                        and the Great Ch’an and Zen Masters wielded the same “double-edged sword” in their earthshaking statements
                        and their illuminating activities. The singular quality of such teachers’ use of dichotomies lies in the
                        fact that they relate them to the actual practice of the hearers, forcing them to integrate them in their
                        minds and actions. Thus, they expect them to be liberated inconceivably, while being totally engaged in
                        the work of helping other living beings. They recommend their full cultivation of great love and great
                        compassion while maintaining total awareness of the total absence of any such thing as a living being, a
                        suffering being, a being in bondage. In short, they show the way to the full nonduality of wisdom and
                        great compassion, the latter being expressed as skill in liberative art—the integrated approach
                        acknowledged by all the masters as the essence of the Mahāyāna.</p>

                    <p tid="23">Vimalakīrti’s reconciliation of dichotomies is so thoroughgoing that he shocks the disciples by
                        his advocacy of the most horrible things as being part of the bodhisattva’s path. The bodhisattva may
                        commit the five deadly sins, follow the false outsider teachings, entertain the sixty-two false views,
                        consort with all the passions, and so on. Even the māras, or devils, that plague the various universes are
                        said to be bodhisattvas dwelling in inconceivable liberation—playing the devil, as it were, in order to
                        develop living beings.</p>

                    <p tid="24">It is an extraordinary fact that Vimalakīrti’s method in integrating the intellectual and
                        behavioral dichotomies is one of many blatant hints of tantric ideas in the background of his teaching
                        method. Futher research is needed to determine whether these connections prove the existence of tantrism
                        at a time earlier than modern scholars generally believe or whether later tantrics found Vimalakīrti’s
                        teachings a source of inspiration. However, the concept of the adept using paths generally considered evil
                        for the attainment of enlightenment and the buddha-qualities is basic in tantric doctrine and practice;
                        Śākyamuni’s revelation of the Sahā world as a jeweled buddhafield accords with tantric method; and
                        Vimalakīrti’s discussion of how a bodhisattva in inconceivable liberation can transfer Mount Sumeru, or an
                        entire universe, into a mustard seed is reminiscent of the yogic practices for transmuting dimensions of

                            of dichotomies (i.e., how even evil can be transmuted to enlightenment, etc.) and an elaborate
                            meditational methodology, employing sacred formulae (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">mantra</foreign>), rituals, and visualizations. The meditation of jewels, buddhas, sacred

                        basing his fine French translation on the Tibetan and the Xuanzang versions. The history comes full circle

                                accords with the Indo-Tibetan emphasis on “transcendental analysis” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vipaśyana</foreign>) as indispensable for realization of the ultimate nature of

                                Truths. The first revolution involves recognition of each truth, the second thorough knowledge of

                        unexcelled, perfect enlightenment, and they have asked what is the bodhisattvas’ purification of the

                            Although the explanations given by the Buddha obviate the need for discussion of the meaning of this
                            term, it is worthwhile to note that this concept is the logical corollary of the bodhisattva’s
                            conception of enlightenment: that it be attained for the sake of all sentient beings as well as for
                            his own sake. Thus, the bodhisattva’s quest for enlightenment does not involve merely his own
                            development, although that is of course primary; it must also involve his cultivation of a whole
                            “field” of living beings, those who, through karmic interconnection, have destinies intertwined with
                            his, occupying the same worlds as he, etc. Hence, his purification of a buddhafield is a mode of
                            expressing his ambition to cultivate a whole world or universe while he cultivates himself, so that he
                            and his field of living beings may reach enlightenment simultaneously.</note> Please, Lord, explain to

                        build a buddhafield in order to develop living beings, he might go ahead, in spite of the fact that it is
                        not possible to build or to adorn a buddhafield in empty space.<note place="end" index="36" xml:id="UT22084-060-005-898"> K and X differ here quite radically. X: “For example, sons, if one
                            should wish to construct a palace in an unoccupied place and then adorn it, he could do so freely and
                            without hindrance, but if he wished to build it in empty space itself, he could never succeed. In the
                            same way, the bodhisattva, although he knows that all things are like empty space, produces pure
                            qualities, for the development and benefit of living beings. That is the buddhafield which he
                            embraces. To embrace a buddhafield in this way is not like building in empty space.” K: “It is as if a
                            man wished to build a building in a vacant place—he could do so without difficulty. But (if he wished
                            to do it) in empty space, he could not succeed. Likewise, the bodhisattva, in order to cultivate all
                            living beings, wants to embrace a buddhafield. One who thus wishes to embrace a buddhafield (does not
                            do so) in the void.” The first impulse of the translator is to resort to the Ch. versions in the
                            interest of simplicity and ease, since the simile there is much more clearly drawn: vacant lot =
                            living beings, empty space = any sort of materialistic notion about a buddhafield; <emph>ergo</emph>
                            building on solid needs of living beings succeeds, and any other way fails. However, upon reflection,
                            what does the Buddha wish to convey in this example? Are not living beings and their needs and
                            purposes just as ultimately empty as “all things”? Would not the concretization of the benefit of
                            living beings violate the definition of liberative technique integrated with wisdom given by
                            Vimalakīrti himself (see <ptr target="#UT22084-060-005-7"/><!--4.22-->)? Is it not more fitting to
                            understand the Buddha here as telling us not to concretize any mundane aims, however beneficial, but
                            that the bodhisattva’s great compassion must always adhere to the wisdom that sees the ephemerality of
                            all purposive notions, constructed or constructive? When we undertake something we know to be
                            essentially impossible, through the sheer intensity of compassion, do we not enter the realm of
                            inconceivability? Finally, may not the Buddha be speaking in tune with his own subsequent miraculous
                            display, as he demonstrates the actual possibility for him, no less than for space-age technology, of
                            building a pure buddhafield in the empty space of ultimate voidness?</note>

                            Thus Vimala­kīrti is telling Mahā­kāśyapa and Kātyāyana that since they do not have intrinsic

                        things, but renunciation is uncompounded, and there can be no question of benefits and virtues in regard
                        to the uncompounded. Reverend Rāhula, renunciation is not material but is free of matter. It is free of
                        the extreme views of beginning and end.<note place="end" index="84" xml:id="UT22084-060-005-946"> Tib.

                        māras. It liberates from the five states of existence, purifies the five eyes, cultivates the five powers,
                        and supports the five spiritual faculties. Renunciation is totally harmless to others and is not
                        adulterated with evil things. It disciplines the outsiders, transcending all denominations. It is the
                        bridge over the swamp of desire, without grasping, and free of the habits of “I” and “mine.” It is without
                        attachment and without disturbance, eliminating all commotion. It disciplines one’s own mind and protects
                        the minds of others. It favors mental quiescence and stimulates transcendental analysis. It is
                        irreproachable in all respects and so is called renunciation. Those who leave the mundane in this way are
                        called “truly renunciant.” Young men, renounce the world in the light of this clear teaching! The
                        appearance of the Buddha is extremely rare. Human <term type="ignore">life</term> endowed with leisure and

                            very aptly: “Reverse the interest in this <term type="ignore">life</term> by thinking over again and again that leisure and
                            opportunity (to practice the Dharma) are hard to find and that there is no (fixed) duration of <term type="ignore">life</term>.
                            Reverse interest in the <term type="ignore">life</term> hereafter by constantly meditating upon the inexorability of karma and
                            the sufferings of the world. Through such concentration, when there is not the slightest ambition,
                            even for a split second, for even the greatest successes in the world, the mind of renunciation has
                            arisen.” See G. Wangyal, <title xml:lang="en">Door of Liberation</title> (New York, Girodias, 1973),

                        will never arrive. If it is a present birth, it does not abide. For the Buddha has declared, “Bhikṣus, in
                        a single moment, you are born, you age, you die, you transmigrate, and you are reborn.”</p>
                    <p tid="179">“ ‘Then might the prophecy concern birthlessness? But birthlessness applies to the stage of

                            it as the reality of birth or as the reality of death? In the former case, this reality is uncreated,
                            and in the latter case, it does not die.” As always, Ch. is less abstract than Tib., but both agree on
                            the general tenor of Vimalakīrti’s refutation of Maitreya’s acceptance of the prophecy as being valid
                            on the ultimate level of reality (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">paramārtha­satyatā</foreign>). On the question of the validity of prophecies on the superficial and

                        reality of all living beings, the reality of all things, and the reality of all the holy ones. If your
                        enlightenment can be prophesied in such a way, so can that of all living beings. Why? Because reality does
                        not consist of duality <ref cRef="F.192.b" type="folio"/> or of diversity. Maitreya, whenever you attain buddhahood,
                        which is the perfection of enlightenment, at the same time all living beings will also attain buddhahood.
                        Why? Enlightenment consists of the realizations of all living beings. Maitreya, at the moment when you
                        attain ultimate liberation, all living beings will also attain ultimate liberation. Why? The tathāgatas do
                        not enter ultimate liberation until all living beings have entered ultimate liberation. For, since all
                        living beings are utterly liberated, the tathāgatas see them as having the nature of ultimate
                        liberation.</p>

                        it will last as long as do the sicknesses of all living beings. Were all living beings to be free from
                        sickness, I also would not be sick. Why? Mañjuśrī, for the bodhisattva, the world consists only of living
                        beings, and sickness is inherent in living in the world. Were all living beings free of sickness, the
                        bodhisattva also would be free of sickness. For example, Mañjuśrī, when the only son of a merchant is
                        sick, both his parents become sick on account of the sickness of their son. And the parents will suffer as
                        long as that only son does not recover from his sickness. Just so, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisattva loves all
                        living beings as if each were his only child. He becomes sick when they are sick and is cured when they
                        are cured. You ask me, Mañjuśrī, whence comes my sickness; the sicknesses of the bodhisattvas arise from
                        great compassion.”</p>

                        consideration: Sickness arises from total involvement in the process of misunderstanding from
                        beginningless time. It arises from the afflictions that result from unreal mental constructions, and hence
                        ultimately nothing is perceived which can be said to be sick. Why? The body is the issue of the four main
                        elements, and in these elements there is no owner and no agent. There is no self in this body, and, except
                        for arbitrary insistence on self, ultimately no ‘I’ which can be said to be sick can be apprehended.
                        Therefore, thinking, ‘ “I” should not adhere to any self, and “I” should rest in the knowledge of the root
                        of illness,’ he should abandon the conception of himself as a personality and produce the conception of
                        himself as a thing, thinking, ‘This body is an aggregate of many things. When it is born, only things are
                        born; when it ceases, only things cease. These things have no awareness or feeling of each other. When
                        they are born, they do not think, “I am born”; when they cease, they do not think, “I cease.” ’ </p>

                        the following consideration: ‘Just as in the case of the conception of “self,” so the conception of
                        “thing” is also a misunderstanding, and this misunderstanding is also a grave sickness; I should free
                        myself from this sickness and should strive to abandon it.’<note place="end" index="120" xml:id="UT22084-060-005-982"> The two thought processes here outlined follow the pattern of the

In short Vimalakīrti is equating sickness with the bodhisattva’s
                            very existence in the world, and the cure he prescribes is the cure for all misery in the
                            world.</note>

                        Why? Because both self and liberation are void. How can both be void? As verbal designations, they both
                        are void, and neither is established in reality. Therefore, one who sees such sameness makes no difference
                        between sickness and voidness; his sickness is itself voidness, and that sickness as voidness is itself

                        Likewise, venerable Śāriputra, when this door of the inconceivable liberation is taught, all the disciples
                        and solitary sages are sightless, like the man blind from birth, and cannot comprehend even a single cause
                        of the inconceivable liberation. Who is there among the wise who, hearing about this inconceivable
                        liberation, does not conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment? As for us, whose faculties
                        are deteriorated, like a burned and rotten seed, what else can we do if we do not become receptive to this

                            arhats of the Individual Vehicle are less fortunate than even the beginner bodhisattvas because,
                            having eliminated their personal suffering, they cannot easily empathize with other living beings and
                            hence find it hard to be inspired with great compassion. This makes their progress from arhat to full
                            buddhahood much slower than that of the bodhisattva. This loss of opportunity occasions the “cry of
                            regret.”</note> And as for the bodhisattvas, when they hear this inconceivable liberation they should
                        be as joyful as a young crown prince when he takes the diadem and is anointed, and they should increase to
                        the utmost their devotion to this inconceivable liberation. Indeed, what could the entire host of māras

                        the principle of nonduality!”</p>
                    <p tid="501">Thereupon, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti kept his silence, saying nothing at all.<note place="end" index="184" xml:id="UT22084-060-005-1046"> This is the most famous moment of the sūtra: Vimalakīrti’s
                            moment of sīlence on the subject of nonduality, i.e., the ultimate. It is noteworthy, however, that
                            Vimalakīrti does talk a great deal about the ultimate on many other occasions; his silence here is
                            given its special impact by the series of profound statements preceding it, which culminate in the
                            statement of Mañjuśrī to the effect that silence is itself the best explanation of nonduality. Hence
                            all silence is not to be exaggeratedly taken as the profoundest teaching, but only such a silence in
                            the special context of profound thought on the ultimate. For example, the silences of the disciples in
                            Chap. 3, as they became speechless when confronted by the eloquent criticism of Vimalakīrti, are not
                            taken to be profound; nor is the silence of Śāriputra when questioned by the goddess in Chap. 8
                            accepted as anything extraordinary. Candrakīrti, in his <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Prasanna­padā</title>
                            (p 57, I.7-8), has this to say in regard to the question as to whether the enlightened ones employ
                            logical arguments or not: “Who can say if the noble ones (employ logical arguments) or not? The
                            ultimate is inherent (even) in the ‘keeping silent of the noble ones.’ What then would cause us to
                            imagine whether they employ logical arguments or do not employ logical arguments?” It is important to
                            note that equating the ultimate with the “keeping silent of the noble ones” in no way precludes the
                            ultimacy of their speech. As the Goddess says to Śāriputra (<ptr target="#UT22084-060-005-16"/><!--6.20-->): “…do not point to liberation by abandoning speech! Why? The holy liberation is the
                            equality of all things!” Thus, to imitate the sūtra’s pattern of expression: “Silence” and “speech”
                            are dualistic. Just as speech is ultimately meaningless, so silence exists only in contrast with
                            speech. Penetration into the equality of silence and speech is the entrance. (see Lamotte, pp 317-318,
                            n 43). </note> The crown prince Mañjuśrī applauded the Licchavi Vimalakīrti: “Excellent! Excellent,

                                or thing itself, since persons and things exist only in the relative, conventional, or superficial
                                sense, and not in any ultimate or absolute sense. To understand Buddhist teaching correctly, we
                                must be clear about the two senses (conventional/ultimate, or relative/absolute), since mistaking
                                denial of ultimate self as denial of conventional self leads to nihilism, and mistaking
                                affirmation of conventional self as affirmation of ultimate self leads to absolutism. Nihilism and
                                absolutism effectively prevent us from realizing our enlightenment, hence are to be
                                avoided.</term>

                                “attainment,” etc., and any of these words might serve. The problem is to establish one English

Therefore, I have

                                is fairly well established, although some prefer the monosyllabic “group.” It is important to bear
                                in mind that the original <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">skandha</foreign> has the sense
                                of “pile,” or “heap,” which has the connotation of utter lack of internal structure, of a randomly
                                collocated pile of things; thus “group” may convey a false connotation of structure and ordered
                                arrangement. The five “compulsive” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">upādāna</foreign>)
                                <term type="ignore">aggregates</term> are of great importance as a schema for introspective meditation in the Abhidharma,
                                wherein each is defined with the greatest subtlety and precision. In fact, the five terms <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">rūpa</foreign>, <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vedanā</foreign>, <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">samjñā</foreign>, saṃskāra, and
                                    <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vijñāna</foreign> have such a particular technical
                                sense that many translators have preferred to leave them untranslated. Nevertheless, in the sūtra
                                context, where the five are meant rather more simply to represent the relative living being (in
                                the realm of desire), it seems preferable to give a translation—in spite of the drawbacks of each
                                possible term—in order to convey the same sense of a total categorization of the psychophysical
                                complex. Thus, for <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">rūpa</foreign>, “matter” is preferred to
                                “form” because it more concretely connotes the physical and gross; for <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vedanā</foreign>, “sensation” is adopted, as limited to the aesthetic; for
                                    <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">samjñā</foreign>, “intellect” is useful in conveying
                                the sense of verbal, conceptual intelligence. For <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">samskāra</foreign>, which covers a number of mental functions as well as inanimate forces,
                                “motivation” gives a general idea. And “consciousness” is so well established for <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vijñāna</foreign> (although what we normally think of as
                                consciousness is more like <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">samjñā</foreign>, i.e.,
                                conceptual and notional, and <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vijñāna</foreign> is rather
                                the “pure awareness” prior to concepts) as to be left unchallenged. </term>

                                ignorance, i.e., that his habitual stream of consciousness is like sleep compared to that of one

                                their stupefaction. Having realized this possibility, he becomes inspired with the intense
                                ambition to attain, and that is called the “<term type="ignore">conception of the spirit of enlightenment</term>.” “Spirit”
                                is preferred to “mind” because the mind of enlightenment should rather be the mind of the Buddha,

All of these
                                refer to mental functions that tend to superimpose upon reality, either relative or ultimate, a
                                conceptualized reality fabricated by the subjective mind. Some translators have tended to lump
                                these together under the rubric “discursive thought,” which leads to the misleading notion that
                                all thought is bad, something to be eliminated, and that sheer “thoughtlessness” is
                                “enlightenment,” or whatever higher state is desired. According to Buddhist scholars, thought in
                                itself is simply a function, and only thought that is attached to its own content over and above
                                the relative object, i.e., “egoistic” thought, is bad and to be eliminated. Therefore we have
                                chosen a set of words for the seven Skt. terms: respectively, “<term type="ignore">conceptualization</term>,” “imagination,”
                                “presumption,” “exaggeration,” “construction,” “conception” or “notion,” and “fabrication.” This
                                does not mean that these words are not somewhat interchangeable or that another English word might
                                not be better in certain contexts; it only represents an attempt to achieve consistency with the
                                original usages. </term>

                                consolidation; the fourth consists of the full entrance to the infinity of space through
                                transcending all conceptions of matter, and the subsequent decline of conceptions of resistance
                                and discredit of conceptions of diversity; the fifth consists of full entrance into the infinity
                                of consciousness, having transcended the infinity of space; the sixth consists of the full

                                is more rarely used in other contexts than “<term type="ignore">emptiness</term>” and does not refer to any sort of ultimate
                                nothingness, as a thing-in-itself, or even as the thing-in-itself to end all things-in-themselves.
                                It is a pure negation of the ultimate existence of anything or, in Buddhist terminology, the
                                “<term type="ignore">emptiness</term> with respect to personal and phenomenal selves,” or “with respect to identity,” or
                                “with respect to intrinsic nature,” or “with respect to essential substance,” or “with respect to
                                self-existence established by intrinsic identity,” or “with respect to ultimate truth-status,”
                                etc. Thus <term type="ignore">emptiness</term> is a concept descriptive of the ultimate reality through its pure negation of
                                whatever may be supposed to be ultimately real. It is an absence, hence not existent in itself. It
                                is synonymous therefore with “infinity,” “absolute,” etc.—themselves all negative terms, i.e.,
                                formed etymologically from a positive concept by adding a negative prefix (in + finite = not
                                finite; ab + solute = not compounded, etc.). But, since our verbally conditioned mental functions
                                are habituated to the connection of word and thing, we tend to hypostatize a “void,” analogous to
                                “outer space,” a “vacuum,” etc., which we either shrink from as a nihilistic nothingness or become
                                attached to as a liberative nothingness; this great mistake can be cured only by realizing the
                                meaning of the “<term type="ignore">emptiness</term> of <term type="ignore">emptiness</term>,” which brings us to the tolerance of inconceivability<!-- (see

                            <term type="definition">This refers to one of the two central qualities of buddhas or high
                                bodhisattvas: their feeling born of the wish for all living beings to be free of suffering and to
                                attain the supreme happiness. It is important to note that this great compassion has nothing to do
                                with any sentimental emotion such as that stimulated by such a reflection as “Oh, the poor
                                creatures! How they are suffering!” On the contrary, great compassion is accompanied by the clear
                                awareness that ultimately there are no such things as living beings, suffering, etc., in reality.
                                Thus it is a sensitivity that does not entertain any dualistic notion of subject and object;
                                indeed, such an unlimited sensitivity might best be termed “empathy.”</term>

                            <term type="definition">This is the expression in action of the great compassion of the Buddha and the
                                bodhisattvas—physical, verbal, and mental. It follows that one empathetically aware of the
                                troubles of living beings would, for his very survival, devise the most potent and efficacious
                                techniques possible to remove those troubles, and the troubles of living beings are removed
                                effectively only when they reach liberation. “Art” was chosen over the usual “method” and “means”
                                because it has a stronger connotation of efficacy in our technological world; also, in Buddhism,
                                <term type="ignore">liberative art</term> is identified with the extreme of power, energy, and efficacy, as symbolized in the
                                    <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vajra</foreign> (adamantine scepter): The importance of
                                this term is highlighted in this sūtra by the fact that Vimalakīrti himself is introduced in the
                                chapter entitled “Inconceivable Skill in <term type="ignore">Liberative Art</term>”; this indicates that he, as a function of
                                the <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">nirmāṇakāya</foreign> (incarnation-body), just like the

                                a technique for the development and liberation of living beings. The “liberative” part of the

                                language, as established for the Deity in the Elizabethan version of the Bible. Indeed, the Skt.
                                    <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhagavān</foreign> was given as a title to the Buddha,
                                although it also served the non-Buddhist Indians of the day and, subsequently, it served as an
                                honorific title of their particular deities. As the Buddha is clearly described in the sūtras as
                                the “Supreme Teacher of Gods and Men,” there seems little danger that he may be confused with any
                                particular deity through the use of this term [as indeed in Buddhist sūtras various deities,
                                creators, protectors, etc., are shown in their respective roles]. Thus I feel it would compromise
                                the weight and function of the original <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhagavān</foreign>
                                to use any less weighty term than “<term type="ignore">Lord</term>” for the Buddha. </term>

                            <term type="definition">“<term type="ignore">Mental quiescence</term>” is a general term for all types of mind-practice,
                                meditation, contemplation, concentration, etc., that cultivate one-pointedness of mind and lead to
                                a state of peacefulness and freedom from concern with any sort of object. It is paired with
                                “transcendental analysis” or “insight,” which combines the analytic faculty with this
                                one-pointedness to reach high realizations such as the absence of self (see “transcendental
                                analysis”). “<term type="ignore">Mental quiescence</term>” and “transcendental analysis” were coined by E. Obermiller in his
                                invaluable study “Prajṅa Pāramitā Doctrine, as Exposed in the Abhisamayālaṃkāra of Maitreya” (Acta
                                Orientalia, Vol. XI [Heidelberg, 1932], pp. 1-134).</term>

                            <term type="definition">This refers to the gnosis of the Buddha, with which there is nothing he does
                                not know. However, not to confuse “<term type="ignore">omniscience</term>” with the theistic conception of an omniscient god,
                                the “everything” here is specifically everything about the source of the predicament of worldly
                                life and the way of transcendence of that world through liberation. Since “everything” is only an
                                abstract term without any particular referent, once we are clear about the implications of
                                infinity, it does not refer to any sort of ultimate totality, since a totality can only be
                                relative, i.e., a totality within a particular frame of reference. Thus, as Dharmakīrti has
                                remarked, “it is not a question of the Buddha’s knowing the number of fish in the ocean,” i.e.,
                                since there are infinity of fish in infinity of oceans in infinity of worlds and universes. The
                                Buddha’s <term type="ignore">omniscience</term>, rather, knows how to develop and liberate any fish in any ocean, as well as

                            <term type="definition">It is crucial to understand what is meant by “<term type="ignore">self</term>,” before one is able to
                                realize the all-important “absence of self.” Before we can discover an absence, we have to know
                                what we are looking for. In Mahāyāna, there is a <term type="ignore">self</term> of persons and a <term type="ignore">self</term> of things, both
                                presumed habitually by living beings and hence informative of their perceptions. Were these
                                “selves” to exist as they appear because of our presumption, they should exist as substantial,
                                self-subsistent entities within things, or as the intrinsic realities of things, or as the
                                intrinsic identities of things, all permanent, unrelated and unrelative, etc. The nondiscovery of
                                such “selves” within changing, relative, interdependent persons and things is the realization of
                                ultimate reality, or absence of self.</term>

                                conditioned by signs that they seem to speak to us as if they had a voice of their own. The letter

To translate <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kṣānti</foreign> as “knowledge” or “conviction” defeats entirely the Skt. usage and its
                                intended sense: In the face of birthlessness or incomprehensibility (i.e., the ultimate reality),
                                ordinary knowledge and especially convictions are utterly lost; this is because the mind loses
                                objectifiability of anything and has nothing to grasp, and its process of coming to terms may be
                                described only as a conscious cancellation through absolute negations of any false sense of
                                certainty about anything. Through this tolerance, the mind reaches a stage where it can bear its
                                lack of bearings, as it were, can endure this kind of extreme openness, this lack of any
                                conviction, etc. There are three degrees of this tolerance—verbal (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ghoṣānugā</foreign>), conforming (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">anulomikī</foreign>), and complete.

                            <term type="definition">This is paired with “mental quiescence” (see entry). In general “meditation”
                                is too often understood as only the types of practices categorized as “quietistic”—which eschew
                                objects, learning, analysis, discrimination, etc., and lead only to the attainment of temporary
                                peace and one-pointedness. However, in order to reach any high realization, such as the absence of
                                a personal self, the absence of a self in phenomena, or voidness, “<term type="ignore">transcendental analysis</term>,” with
                                its analytical penetration to the nature of ultimate reality, is indispensable. The analysis is
                                called “transcendental” because it does not accept anything it sees as it appears. Instead,
                                through analytic examination, it penetrates to its deeper reality, going ever deeper in infinite
                                penetration until tolerance is reached. All apparently self-sufficient objects are seen through
                                and their truth-status is rejected—first conceptually and finally perceptually, at buddhahood.
                                Thus “meditation,” to be efficacious, must include both mental quiescence (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">śamatha</foreign>), and <term type="ignore">transcendental analysis</term> (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vipaśyana</foreign>) in integrated combination. </term>

                                (lineages) according to their destinies: disciple lineage, solitary buddha lineage, buddha
                                lineage, etc. The Mādhyamika school, and the sūtras that are its foundation, maintains that all
                                living beings belong to the buddha lineage, that Disciple Vehicle nirvāṇa is not a final destiny,
                                and that arhats must eventually enter the Mahāyāna path. Mañjuśrī carries this idea to the
                                extreme, finding the tathāgata lineage everywhere, in all mundane things. See <ptr target="#UT22084-060-005-21"/><!--7.9-->, and Lamotte, Appendice, Note VII.</term>
