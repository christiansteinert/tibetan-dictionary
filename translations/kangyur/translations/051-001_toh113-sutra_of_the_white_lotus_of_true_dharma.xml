                    <title xml:lang="en">The White Lotus of the Good Dharma</title>, popularly known
                    as the <title xml:lang="en">Lotus Sūtra</title>, is taught by Buddha Śākyamuni
                    on Vulture Peak to an audience that includes bodhisattvas from countless realms,
                    as well as bodhisattvas who emerge out from the ground from the space below this
                    world. Buddha Prabhūtaratna, who has long since passed into nirvāṇa, appears
                    within a floating stūpa to hear the sūtra, and Śākyamuni enters the stūpa and
                    sits beside him. The <title xml:lang="en">Lotus Sūtra</title> is celebrated,
                    particularly in East Asia, for its presentation of crucial elements of the
                    Mahāyāna tradition, such as the doctrine that there is only one yāna, or
                    “vehicle”; the distinction between expedient and definite teachings; and the
                    notion that the Buddha’s life, enlightenment, and parinirvāṇa were simply
                    manifestations of his transcendent buddhahood, while he continues to teach
                    eternally. A recurring theme in the sūtra is its own significance in teaching
                    these points during past and future eons, with many passages in which the Buddha
                    and bodhisattvas such as Samantabhadra describe the great benefits that come
                    from devotion to it, the history of its past devotees, and how it is the
                    Buddha’s ultimate teaching, supreme over all other sūtras. </p>

                    <p tid="2401">If we try to imagine 2,500 years ago, atop a small mountain in the
                        ancient kingdom of Magadha, in the heat of the subcontinental sun, an
                        audience—that included 1,200 bhikṣus, 2,000 bhikṣus-in-training, and 6,000
                        bhikṣunīs—gathering around Buddha Śākyamuni, we might have some difficulty.
                        It is difficult to imagine historical places to which we have never been. It
                        is also difficult to imagine such a large group of people fitting
                        comfortably on a small mountain. And even more difficult to imagine it if
                        one has been recently to the actual place, in the Indian state of Bihar,
                        where all of this supposedly took place.</p>

                    <p tid="2402">But if we do not at least try to use our minds to imagine these
                        things—if we remain limited by our concepts of reality and relative
                        plausibility—then it will be difficult to receive the blessings, to
                        understand the teachings, and to really practice the instructions contained
                        within a sūtra as historically celebrated as <title xml:lang="en">The White
                            Lotus of the Good Dharma</title>.</p>

                    <p tid="2403">Popularly known as the <title xml:lang="en">Lotus Sūtra</title>,
                        this is one of the most revered Mahāyāna sūtras in the history of Buddhism.
                        Devotion to it as being superior to all other sūtras has, in China, Korea,
                        and Japan, created traditions based solely upon this sūtra. The Japanese
                        chant <foreign type="quote" xml:lang="Ja-Ltn">Namu myōhō renge kyō</foreign>
                        (南無妙法蓮華經 “Homage to the White Lotus of the Good Dharma Sūtra”) has become
                        the primary practice of tens of thousands of so-called Buddhists around the
                        world. The mere existence of this sūtra must have brought millions of people
                        into the Dharma and done much to ensure devotion to Buddhism and patronage
                        of it over millennia.</p>

                    <p tid="2404">We should rejoice in this. But we should also be mindful that
                        rigid attachment to the letter—rather than the spirit—of this sūtra has led
                        to some misunderstanding and discord amongst Buddhists. And that is not a
                        good thing. For example, the <title xml:lang="en">Lotus Sūtra</title> has
                        been wrongly invoked to justify gender bias, material grasping, and even
                        self-immolation and militant proselytizing. So it is most important to read
                        and study this profound sūtra with a proper understanding of its underlying
                        meaning and spirit.</p>

                    <p tid="2405">In the evolution of humankind, we have constantly strengthened our
                        capacity to think and communicate in ways that not only convey information,
                        but also create imagined worlds. It was this ability to forge common myths,
                        imagined orders, and hierarchies that enabled us humans to cooperate in
                        larger numbers than ever before, leading us to evolve from being
                        hunter-gatherers to settling in small agrarian communities, and then in
                        towns and cities. Over the centuries, we have come to believe more and more
                        in the imagined realities of corporations, nations, and hierarchies.</p>

                    <p tid="2406">We Buddhists are not immune to these belief systems. For example,
                        Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna Buddhists have evolved their own entrenched
                        hierarchies that often look down on the Śrāvakayāna. Even the often-used
                        term “Hīnayāna” can be used by Mahāyānists in a derogatory and chauvinist
                        way to look down on the śrāvakas. This is really very important to note here
                        because the <title xml:lang="en">Lotus Sūtra</title> has been misused time
                        and time again by such chauvinists to justify and entrench their feeling of
                        superiority.</p>

                        hierarchies, for each of us more lowly beings there is only the yāna we are
                        taught and that we should be practicing. This emphasizes the importance of
                        the role of the teacher who gives us the practices suited to our own

                    <p tid="2413">We must always remember that a tathāgata “appears in this world
                        for that one deed and one action, for that one great deed and great action,
                        and with that intention.” A tathāgatha does not discriminate between beings,
                        nor judge the yānas that are taught to them or by them. Remember, the Buddha
                        is also known as the Tathāgata, and also has many more names, including
                        Arhat, the Tibetan of which literally translates as a “foe-destroyer.” But
                        in his case, foes were not people. They were his emotions and his habit of
                        clinging to his ego, which he overcame. Throughout his previous one thousand
                        lifetimes as a bodhisattva, the only things the Tathāgata ever destroyed
                        were his emotions and his ego; he never once harmed a single being.</p>

                    <p tid="2414">And so, when we talk about the motivation of tathāgatas to appear
                        in this world, we must remember that, like the Buddha, they have as their
                        only intention and motivation the enlightenment of others. As a buddha, the
                        Tathāgata possesses “supreme skill in methods” and teaches according to “the
                        various aspirations, natures, and thoughts of beings.” In a way, we can say
                        that the Dharma teachings one receives are like bespoke suiting: a tall,
                        lanky man and a round, jolly one could be wearing the same suit, made of the
                        same cloth, and the same thread, but with the skill of an experienced
                        tailor, they are fitted—bespoke—for the individual. From afar, passers-by
                        would say these two men are wearing the same suit, because the end result is
                        that both are wrapped in the same cloth and both look good in it, but the
                        methods used, the size of the patterns, and the particular cut might have
                        been very different. Similarly, the ways in which the Dharma is taught are
                        meant to be similarly bespoke. The Buddha says:</p>

                        that being. In that sense, this idea of a hierarchy is no longer as real as

                        (Skt. <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">upāya</foreign>). The word

                        the connotation of a “trick”—or even a “catalyst,” because skillful methods
                        speed things up without affecting the elements involved.</p>

                    <p tid="2418">Ideally, a skilled spiritual master will change the skillful
                        method or “trick” they use to suit the capacity of the person they are
                        dealing with. Does lemon have the same effect on wine that it has on cow’s
                        milk? No. Even if liters and liters of lemon juice were added to wine, it
                        would not separate into curds and whey. Similarly, a skillful method that
                        works extremely well for one person might be useless for someone else. This
                        is why the path is so meticulous and complex, and also why it is so
                        intriguing. When the right trick is applied to the right person, the right
                        result is achieved. The Mahāyāna really excels when it comes to these kinds
                        of methods.</p>

                        geographic region or race. Nor has it become a survival kit for just one
                        nationality. More than twenty-five centuries have passed since the Buddha
                        taught this sūtra. In that time, the <title xml:lang="en">Lotus
                            Sūtra</title> has inspired millions of beings to seek liberation for the
                        sake of all beings. When a teaching has been around for a while, it is
                        important to consult and examine its source texts. For Muslims, that source
                        is the Koran; for Christians, it is the Bible; and for Jews, it is the
                        Torah. The source of all the Buddha’s teachings is the sūtras, because it is
                        the sūtras that faithfully record the Buddha’s own words. As the sūtras are
                        the Buddhadharma’s bottom line, it is crucial for all Buddhists to read,
                        learn, and explore them with an open heart and to understand them
                        accurately.</p>

                        motivation of desperately wanting all sentient beings to awaken. We are not
                        on this path for a good life, or for a better car than our neighbors, or to
                        create more hierarchies and prejudices than exist already in our mundane
                        worlds. We must always remind ourselves of our intention: we must look for

                        subsequently Sanskritized, resulting in what is called Buddhist Hybrid
                        Sanskrit (BHS). BHS contains words that are either not found in Classical
                        Sanskrit, or have a different meaning. In this sūtra, some words are closer
                        in meaning to their counterparts in Pali (which is itself a slightly
                        Sanskritized Middle Indic) than to the same words in Classical Sanskrit.
                        Also, different versions of this sūtra show instances of how the same Middle
                        Indic word was rendered differently in BHS. Seishi Karashima has pointed
                        out, for example, that the Middle Indic <foreign xml:lang="middle_indic-Ltn" type="term">ajja</foreign> was interpreted as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">adya</foreign> (“today”) in the surviving central Asian

                        sūtra from the tenth chapter onward. Later chapters reflect the negative
                        reaction to the promulgation of the original sūtra, containing admonitions
                        to endure persecution, providing blessings for protection from persecution,
                        and describing the evil fate that awaits the sūtra’s critics and
                        persecutors. Thus, there seems to have been a gradual accretion in the size

                        additional passages, as can be seen by comparing the Chinese translations to
                        the Tibetan. Perhaps the last passage added to a Sanskrit version was the

                        Devadatta, Buddha Śākyamuni’s cousin. Elsewhere in the Buddhist tradition he
                        is portrayed as a villain who divided the saṅgha by becoming a rival
                        teacher, attempted to assassinate the Buddha, and eventually fell into hell
                        when the earth opened up beneath his feet. Even in the Jātaka stories, a
                        character that plays a villainous role is usually declared to have been a

                        prophesies his buddhahood. The Buddhist tradition of Devadatta continued in
                        India for at least a millennium, is mentioned in Pali texts as late as the
                        fifth century, and is described by Chinese pilgrims to India, including
                        Xuanzang (c. 602–64), who recorded three seventh century Devadatta Buddhist

                        ancient library. Ironically the dynasty came to an end when it was conquered
                        by Tibet in 737 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, and the Buddhist sculptures
                        sponsored by the royal family were taken to Tibet. This was during the reign
                        of King Tride Tsuktsen (704–54), who was the father of Trisong Detsen

                    <p tid="42">Regarding the translation of pronouns, in Tibetan there is often no
                        distinction between masculine or feminine, or even between singular and
                        plural, but the Sanskrit of the sūtra frequently uses the masculine
                        singular. Since this Sanskrit usage of the masculine singular can usually be
                        interpreted as a general category that includes both sexes and refers to
                        both male and female devotees, we have chosen to render such pronouns as the
                        more gender inclusive “they” whenever the context allows it. However, in
                        passages that very clearly refer specifically to males, we have allowed
                        context to override gender inclusivity and have rendered the pronouns
                        accordingly as the masculine singular “he.” </p>

                        appears rather awkward. Similarly, “son of a merchant” can, according to
                        context, just mean “merchant.” Also the epithets “son of a [noble] family”
                        and “daughter of a [noble] family” refer to a noble person and are simply
                        polite forms of address, akin to the English “ladies and gentlemen,” and so
                        they have not been translated literally as “sons” or “daughters.”</p>

                        great number of worlds). However, it is sometimes uncertain whether <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">lokadhātu</foreign> is referring simply to
                        one world, as in early Buddhism, or to a group of many such worlds. The
                        terms <distinct>universe</distinct> and <distinct>cosmos</distinct> are too
                        comprehensive for such a set of worlds, as a number of these sets are said
                        to coexist. <distinct>Galaxy</distinct> has been used in some translations

                                that it is an omen that the Buddha is going to teach <title xml:lang="en">The White Lotus of the Good Dharma</title>.
                                Mañjuśrī knows this because he had seen the same thing occur in a

                            <p tid="49">The Buddha comes out of his meditation and tells Śāriputra
                                of how the buddhas possess skill in methods for liberating beings,
                                and their wisdom is inconceivable to śrāvakas and pratyeka­buddhas.
                                Śāriputra requests the Buddha three times to explain what he means.
                                Five thousand bhikṣus leave the assembly, not wishing to hear the
                                teaching. The Buddha states that there is only one yāna, which is
                                the way to buddhahood, and the division into three yānas is merely a
                                skillful method used by the buddhas. He warns that in the future,
                                śrāvakas will not preserve this sūtra. He describes the benefits for
                                those who will have devotion for it, and he also states that those
                                who make even the simplest offerings to the buddhas will eventually
                                attain enlightenment as a result. The Buddha describes his
                                enlightenment, his previous teachings on attaining nirvāṇa, and how
                                the time came to begin teaching the attainment of buddhahood. He
                                also states that those who reject this sūtra will be reborn in
                                hell.</p>

                                received the teachings given to the bodhisattvas, but is now happy
                                because he has received them. The Buddha explains that in previous
                                lives Śāriputra had received this teaching, and he prophesies that
                                in a future eon Śāriputra will become Buddha Padmaprabha in a pure
                                realm called Virajā. Śāriputra states that there are those in the
                                assembly who are confused as to why there is a new teaching. He asks
                                the Buddha to explain. The Buddha says he will do so through a
                                parable. He describes a vast decrepit house, full of dangerous
                                monsters and creatures, that catches fire. The owner sees that his
                                sons are playing inside. They are so engrossed in their play that
                                they do not heed their father’s warning. He then promises them
                                ox-carts, goat-carts, and deer-carts, which fulfills their various
                                longings. They all rush outside, thus escaping from the house. The
                                father then gives them all magnificent ox-carts. The Buddha says
                                that the father employed a skillful method so as to save them, and
                                in the end they all got the best kind of cart. Therefore the father
                                could not be called a liar. The word for <distinct>cart</distinct>
                                in Sanskrit is <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">yāna</foreign>, and the cart they are all eventually given is a
                                “great cart,” in other words, the Mahāyāna. This establishes that
                                the Buddha uses the skillful method of giving various teachings so
                                as to liberate beings from saṃsāra, but eventually he gives them all
                                the supreme teaching of omniscient wisdom, the one true yāna, which
                                is the Mahāyāna.</p>

                            <label>Chapter 4: The Aspiration</label>
                            <p tid="53">The principal elder monks, such as Mahākāśyapa, state that
                                they are astonished to hear this new teaching. They had never
                                previously had the intention to become buddhas, but only to attain
                                nirvāṇa. They then relate the parable of a man whose son wandered
                                away, becoming a beggar for fifty years. The father, meanwhile,
                                searching for the son, comes to another city where he becomes
                                incredibly wealthy. The son one day arrives at the father’s house
                                and, intimidated by his wealth and importance, flees. The father,
                                recognizing him, sends people to bring him back, but the son panics.
                                Therefore the father uses a ruse: he sends some low-class people to
                                offer him the job of clearing away the rubbish and waste of the
                                house. The son lives in a straw hut beside the house and does that
                                work. Gradually, over twenty years, the father has the son working
                                inside his home and taking care of all his wealth, although he still
                                lives in poverty in his straw hut. When he sees that his son is
                                ready, he holds a great meeting, announces the identity of his son,
                                and bestows all his wealth on him; the son is overjoyed. The elders
                                state that they were like this son, who knew of the teaching
                                practiced by the bodhisattvas for attaining buddhahood, and even
                                taught it to them, but they themselves did not have the confidence
                                for such a great goal. However, on this day they are overjoyed to
                                hear from the Buddha that they also are able to attain
                                buddhahood.</p>

                            <label>Chapter 5: Herbs</label>
                            <p tid="55">The Buddha relates to Mahākāśyapa the parable of how the
                                rain falls equally on all plants, from the smallest herbs to the
                                greatest trees, nourishing them all in accordance with their needs,
                                and in this way he teaches the Dharma to beings on different levels
                                according to their needs, and does not give them all the teaching on
                                the attainment of omniscience. He teaches another parable on how the
                                light of the sun and the moon shines equally on all, and, in the
                                same way, the light of the Buddha’s wisdom shines on all, whatever
                                their aspirations. This light gives them the exact teaching they
                                aspire to, and that is why there are the teachings of the three
                                yānas. He also teaches the parable of how a potter makes pots from
                                the same clay, but they are used to contain different substances and
                                therefore given different designations. In the same way, there is
                                but one yāna, the Buddhayāna, but because of the differences among
                                beings, there are the designations of śrāvakas, pratyeka­buddhas,
                                and bodhisattvas. The Buddha also teaches the parable of a man who,
                                because he is blind from birth, does not believe there is a sun,
                                moon, or anything to be seen. A compassionate physician obtains
                                herbs from the Himalayas and cures him. Realizing he was previously
                                ignorant, the man thinks he can now see everything, but clairvoyant
                                rishis make him realize his sight is still limited. He practices in
                                solitude and gains higher knowledge. In that way beings are blinded
                                by ignorance, but the Buddha teaches them so that they are freed
                                from saṃsāra. They believe they have attained the ultimate goal of
                                nirvāṇa, but the Buddha explains that there is still the omniscience
                                of buddhas to be attained.</p>

                            <p tid="57">The Buddha prophesies how Mahākāśyapa will, in a future
                                time, after being a student of millions of buddhas, become a buddha
                                named Raśmiprabhāsa in a pure realm called Avabhāsaprāptā. The
                                Buddha describes the length of his lifespan and the subsequent
                                duration of his teachings. Mahā­maudgalyāyana, Subhūti, and
                                Mahākātyāyana pray in their minds for prophecies, which the Buddha
                                subsequently gives for each of them. Subhūti will become Buddha
                                Śaśiketu in the pure realm Ratnasaṃbhava. Mahākātyāyana will become

                                Mahā­maudgalyāyana will become Buddha Tamāla­patra­candana­gandha in

                            <label>Chapter 7: The Past</label>
                            <p tid="59">The Buddha tells of a time in the distant past when Buddha
                                Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū spent ten intermediate eons under the Bodhi
                                tree to attain enlightenment. His sixteen sons came to supplicate
                                him for teachings, as did brahmās from quintillions of world realms
                                in every direction. He gave the teachings of the four truths of the
                                āryas and of dependent origination, and his saṅgha became
                                innumerable. At a request from his sixteen sons for the highest
                                Dharma, he taught <title xml:lang="en">The White Lotus of the Good
                                    Dharma</title> for a hundred thousand eons. Then he entered
                                solitude and each of the sixteen sons taught the sūtra to
                                quintillions of beings. The Buddha states that the sixteen sons have
                                become sixteen buddhas, one of whom is himself, and his students
                                from that distant time are again his students in the present. He
                                then gives the parable of a guide leading a great number of beings
                                through a vast jungle on the way to an island of jewels. When they
                                become exhausted and wish to turn back he magically creates a city
                                for them to rest in. When they are rested he tells them the city was
                                an illusion and that they should continue their journey. Similarly,
                                the Buddha has taught the yānas and nirvāṇas of the śrāvakas and
                                pratyeka­buddhas to beings so that they may rest on their journey to
                                buddhahood, whereas there is truly only one nirvāṇa and yāna, that
                                of buddhahood.</p>

                            <p tid="61">The Buddha declares Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇī­putra to be the supreme
                                teacher of the Dharma from among his saṅgha, and that he was also
                                the principal teacher for the six previous buddhas and will be for
                                the remaining ninety-six buddhas of this eon. He says that in the
                                distant future he will be Buddha Dharmaprabhāsa in this world, which
                                at that time will have become a miraculous pure realm. The twelve
                                hundred arhats present wish in their minds to also receive
                                prophecies. Knowing this, the Buddha gives them. First he says that
                                Kauṇḍinya will become a buddha named Samanta­prabhāsa, and five
                                hundred of the arhats will follow him as successive buddhas all
                                named Samanta­prabhāsa. Without any detail he states that it will be
                                the same for the others. The five hundred arhats confess their
                                previous ignorance and describe it through the parable of a man
                                whose friend had sewn a jewel in his clothes, but who later, unaware
                                of that jewel, was living as a destitute beggar concerned only with
                                finding food, until his friend found him and showed the jewel. They
                                say they had in this way been ignorant of the Buddha’s higher
                                teachings and had been concerned only with attaining nirvāṇa, which
                                they now realize is not the true nirvāṇa. Now, however, they have
                                understood this and are overjoyed to receive his prophecy of their
                                eventual buddhahood.</p>

                                Bhikṣus</label>
                            <p tid="63">Ānanda, Rāhula, and two thousand bhikṣus make the aspiration
                                to receive a prophecy from the Buddha. First the Buddha prophesies
                                that Ānanda, after serving quintillions of buddhas, will become
                                Buddha Sāgara­vara­dhara­buddhi­vikrīḍitābhijña. New bodhisattvas
                                wonder why a śrāvaka should receive such a prophecy instead of a
                                bodhisattva. The Buddha explains that he and Ānanda began their
                                spiritual journey together, but because Ānanda focused on receiving
                                teachings rather than practice, he has been the principal keeper of
                                the Dharma for quintillions of buddhas. Then the Buddha prophesies
                                that Rāhula, who is his own son, will become Buddha
                                Sapta­ratna­padma­vikrānta­gāmin, and until that time he will be the
                                son of every buddha, lastly that of Ānanda as the Buddha
                                Sāgara­vara­dhara­buddhi­vikrīḍitābhijña. The Buddha then prophesies
                                that the two thousand bhikṣus will all simultaneously in different
                                realms become buddhas, all named Ratnaketurāja, who will have
                                identical realms and lifespans.</p>

                            <label>Chapter 10: The Dharmabhāṇakas</label>
                            <p tid="65">The Buddha addresses principally the bodhisattva
                                Bhaiṣajyarāja and tells him that all in the assembly are
                                bodhisattvas, and whoever even hears one line of verse from the
                                sūtra will attain buddhahood. He says that those who transmit this
                                sūtra should be honored as if they were buddhas and that stūpas
                                should be built wherever the sūtra is taught, recited, or written.
                                Speaking badly of such a dharmabhāṇaka would be worse than insulting
                                the Buddha to his face for an eon. He says that a bodhisattva who
                                does not know this sūtra is far from buddhahood, like a man digging
                                a well and encountering only dry earth, while a bodhisattva who
                                knows the sūtra is close to buddhahood, like a well-digger
                                encountering wet earth, which is a sign of the proximity of water.
                                The Buddha states that in the future, when someone teaches this

                                If someone recites it in solitude in a forest he will emanate
                                nonhuman beings to listen to that person. In the concluding verses
                                he says his emanations will protect a teacher of this sūtra from
                                physical attacks and abuse, and he will manifest before those
                                reciting the sūtra in solitude and will check and correct their
                                recitation.</p>

                            <label>Chapter 11: The Appearance of the Stūpa</label>
                            <p tid="67">A gigantic stūpa rises into the sky from the midst of the
                                assembly. A voice commends the Buddha for teaching this sūtra. The
                                Buddha explains to the bodhisattva Mahāpratibhāna that this is the
                                stūpa of Buddha Prabhūtaratna, who attained enlightenment through
                                this sūtra. Buddha Prabhūtaratna had prayed to appear within his own
                                stūpa wherever the sūtra was taught. He also prayed that any buddhas
                                teaching it would bring all their emanations from other realms to
                                that world to listen, and he also prayed that his stūpa would be
                                opened by those buddhas. Buddha Śākyamuni then draws his
                                quintillions of emanations as other buddhas into his world realm,
                                which is transformed into a pure realm. Those buddhas all send
                                attendants to Śākyamuni requesting the opening of the stūpa.
                                Śākyamuni levitates and opens it, revealing Buddha Prabhūtaratna
                                inside. He sits next to him, and describes the uniquely incalculable
                                merit of teaching the sūtra. The Buddha then describes his previous
                                life as a king dedicated to the Dharma who became a rishi’s slave in
                                order to hear this sūtra. As a result of that he has now attained
                                the qualities of a buddha. He states that the rishi was a previous
                                life of Devadatta, who in the future will be the buddha Devarāja.
                                The bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa, who is from Buddha Prabhūtaratna’s
                                realm, requests that Prabhūtaratna come back to his realm. The
                                Buddha asks Prajñākūṭa to stay for a while and talk with Mañjuśrī.
                                Mañjuśrī miraculously comes from the palace of the nāga king Sāgara,
                                which is in the ocean, and manifests for Prajñākūṭa the vast number
                                of bodhisattvas he has guided toward enlightenment in the ocean. He
                                also describes the great qualities of the nāga king’s daughter and
                                states that she can attain buddhahood. When Prajñākūṭa finds that
                                hard to believe, the nāga princess appears. Śāriputra says to her
                                that a woman cannot attain buddhahood, regardless of her qualities.
                                The nāga princess then offers a jewel as valuable as the world realm
                                to the Buddha and states that she can attain buddhahood faster than
                                making that offering. She transforms into a male bodhisattva and
                                goes to a southern realm and becomes a buddha. Everyone in this
                                world realm is able to see that buddha teaching in that realm.</p>

                            <p tid="69">The bodhisattvas Bhaiṣajyarāja, Mahāpratibhāna, and two
                                hundred thousand others reassure the Buddha that they will teach the
                                sūtra in the future. The bhikṣus also state they will teach it in
                                other world realms. The Buddha tells his aunt Mahāprajāpatī that in
                                the distant future she will become Buddha
                                Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana, that her following of six thousand
                                bhikṣunīs will be her students, and that she will prophesy their
                                buddhahood. Similarly, the Buddha tells Yaśodharā, who had been his
                                wife, that she will become Buddha
                                Raśmi­śata­sahasra­paripūrṇa­dhvaja. Then eighty-thousand
                                bodhisattvas declare that they will teach the Dharma in the later
                                times, enduring all persecution and rejection.</p>

                            <p tid="71">Mañjuśrī asks the Buddha how bodhisattvas should teach the
                                sūtra in the future. The Buddha says they should have four
                                qualities: (1) In terms of practice they should have self-control
                                and see correctly the characteristics of phenomena; in terms of
                                their field of activity they should stay apart from society and
                                worldly life, and in particular avoid attraction to women. (2) They
                                should see the emptiness of phenomena. (3) They should also remain
                                in a state of happiness and never criticize others; they should not
                                discourage people, by saying that they are unable to attain
                                enlightenment. (4) They should remain far from others but have
                                compassion for them, and wish to attain buddhahood so as to liberate
                                them. The Buddha then prophesies that such bodhisattvas will be
                                greatly revered by humans and devas. The Buddha gives the parable of
                                a king rewarding heroic warriors with all kinds of gifts, and
                                finally giving his crest jewel. The Buddha explains that in the same
                                way he has taught many sūtras to those battling Māra, but his final
                                marvelous gift is this sūtra, his final teaching that he has kept
                                secret until this moment.</p>

                            <p tid="73">The bodhisattvas who have come from other world realms make
                                the commitment to teach this sūtra in the future. The Buddha says
                                that it will not be necessary as he has so many bodhisattvas in his
                                realm. Immediately the ground splits open and out from the ground
                                come countless bodhisattvas who dwell in the space below the world.
                                The four main ones among these—Vi­śiṣṭa­cāritra, Anantacāritra,
                                Vi­śuddha­cāritra, and Su­pratiṣṭhita­cāritra—ask after his welfare.
                                Maitreya asks the Buddha who these bodhisattvas are whom no one has
                                ever seen before. The Buddha says that they were all brought onto
                                the path of enlightenment by himself after he attained buddhahood.
                                Maitreya states that these bodhisattvas have been practicing for
                                many eons, and this is like a young man introducing hundred-year-old
                                men as his sons. Even though all present believe whatever the Buddha
                                says, future bodhisattvas on hearing this will doubt it and as a
                                result be reborn in the lower realms, and so he asks the Buddha to
                                explain how this can be so.</p>

                            <p tid="75">The bodhisattvas ask the Buddha to explain what his long
                                life means. He states that he had attained buddhahood countless
                                quintillions of eons ago, but stated that he had only recently
                                attained it in order to guide beings, and therefore that was not a
                                lie. He appears to pass into nirvāṇa but does not, and this is also
                                not a lie, but to prevent beings from being complacent. He gives the
                                parable of a doctor whose sons have been poisoned. He has the
                                antidote but some of his sons will not take it because their minds
                                are affected. He then goes away and sends them the news that he has
                                died. They then realize the value of what he has given them and take
                                the antidote. The doctor then reveals to them that he is still
                                alive. In the same way, the Buddha uses skillful methods and should
                                not be called a liar.</p>

                            <p tid="77">The Buddha tells Maitreya that hearing this teaching on his
                                lifespan has caused countless bodhisattvas to attain various levels
                                of accomplishment. Miraculous events also occurred wherever the
                                buddhas who had gathered were present. The Buddha states that
                                hearing this teaching and believing it brings an inconceivably
                                greater merit than practicing the first five perfections for eons.
                                Those who have faith in the teaching will see the Buddha teaching in
                                this world as a pure realm filled with bodhisattvas. Those who carry
                                the text on their shoulder are carrying the Buddha, and they do not
                                need to build stūpas or temples, as those who have this devotion to
                                the sūtra have made vast offerings in the presence of the Buddha.
                                They will develop excellent qualities and will attain buddhahood.
                                Caityas should be built in honor of the Buddha wherever teachers of
                                this sūtra have been.</p>

                            <p tid="79">Maitreya asks the Buddha how much merit is created from
                                rejoicing in hearing the sūtra. The Buddha gives a parable of
                                someone who hears the teaching and repeats it to someone else, who
                                repeats it to someone else, and so on, until it is heard by a
                                fiftieth person. Even if they only hear one line of verse, their
                                merit is far greater than that of a person who satisfies all the
                                beings in four hundred thousand realms with gifts for eighty years
                                and then brings them all to arhathood. The merit such a person would
                                accrue would not even be a quintillionth of the merit of the one who
                                rejoiced in hearing one line of verse that had been passed on
                                through fifty people. Those who go to a temple to listen to the
                                sūtra even briefly will have excellent carriages in their future
                                life. If they sit down they will have the thrones of deities and
                                kings, and if they make someone else listen to it, even for a
                                moment, they will have an excellent physical body in their future
                                lives.</p>

                                qualities of purified faculties, which are those of the body’s

                                as long as a year, and knowing all the thoughts of all beings in a

                            <p tid="83">The Buddha tells the bodhisattva Mahā­sthāma­prāpta that
                                those who revile adherents to this sūtra will experience the bad
                                result of being mute, while those who support it will have purified
                                faculties. He says that long ago there was a world in which there
                                was a series of millions of buddhas all named
                                Bhīṣma­garjita­svara­rāja. When the Dharma of the first of these was
                                coming to an end, there was a bodhisattva called Sadāparibhūta who
                                endured the condemnation of other monastics and lay-followers. When
                                he was dying he heard the words of <title xml:lang="en">The White
                                    Lotus of the Good Dharma</title> coming from the air, taught
                                those who had previously reviled him, and lived on for millions of
                                years, teaching this sūtra during the time of millions of succeeding
                                buddhas until finally he attained enlightenment. Śākyamuni reveals
                                that he was Sadāparibhūta and also that those who reviled him were
                                now among his students. He encourages them to maintain and teach
                                this sūtra after he has passed into nirvāṇa.</p>

                            <p tid="85">Vi­śiṣṭa­cāritra and the other bodhisattvas who emerged from
                                the ground, along with a vast number of other beings, make their
                                commitment to uphold the sūtra in the future. Then both Śākyamuni
                                and Prabhūtaratna, still seated inside the stūpa, and the buddhas in
                                the other world realms, extend their tongues as far as the paradise
                                of Brahmā, and their tongues radiate a vast number of light rays,
                                from within which appear countless bodhisattvas who teach the Dharma
                                while floating in the sky above a great number of worlds. This
                                miracle continues for a hundred thousand years. Then they make the
                                sound of clearing their throats and snap their fingers, a sound that
                                is heard throughout the worlds, which shake. All the buddhas then
                                declare that the beings in the other worlds should pay homage to
                                Śākyamuni and make offerings to him because he is teaching this
                                sūtra. They throw offerings in his direction and they cover like a
                                canopy this world and all other worlds. The Buddha states that there
                                would be no end to describing the benefits of maintaining and
                                promulgating this sūtra, and wherever it is taught or transcribed
                                should be regarded as a holy place of the Buddha.</p>

                            <p tid="87">The bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja asks the Buddha how much merit
                                someone who upholds this sūtra will have. The Buddha replies that
                                someone dedicated to just one line of verse from the sūtra will have
                                greater merit than that from making offerings to quintillions of
                                buddhas. Bhaiṣajyarāja then recites a dhāraṇī that will protect the
                                holders of the sūtra from attacks, and states that to attack such a
                                person is to attack the quintillions of buddhas who have pronounced
                                that dhāraṇī. Then the bodhisattva Pradānaśūra recites a dhāraṇī for
                                the same purpose. Then the deity Vaiśravaṇa, one of the four
                                mahārāja deities, recites a dhāraṇī for the protection and good
                                fortune of holders of the sūtra. Then Virūḍhaka, one of the other
                                mahārājas, arrives and recites a protective dhāraṇī. Then the
                                rākṣasī Hārītī, accompanied by ten other rākṣasīs and their
                                followers, comes and recites a protective dhāraṇī, which they all
                                say will make the head of one who attacks a holder of this sūtra
                                explode. The Buddha expresses his pleasure and tells them to protect
                                those who study and offer to the sūtra, even someone who only knows
                                the name of the sūtra.</p>

                            <p tid="89">The bodhisattva Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña asks the
                                Buddha to relate what the bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja has practiced in
                                his past lives. The Buddha says that in the distant past there was a
                                buddha named Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī with a lifespan of
                                many eons in a world that was a pure realm. He taught <title xml:lang="en">The White Lotus of the Good Dharma</title>. His
                                student bodhisattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana practices this and
                                attains samādhi, at which time miraculous events occur. Then
                                Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana spends twelve years eating aromatic
                                resins and drinking perfumed oils and then sets his body on fire as
                                an offering to the Buddha. The light of the fire shines through many
                                worlds and the buddhas there commend him for his supreme offering.
                                He burns for twelve years and then is miraculously born, with the
                                power of speech, to a king. He then flies in a precious palace to
                                see Buddha Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī. That buddha tells him
                                that he is passing into nirvāṇa that very night and entrusts his
                                students and his relics to Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana.
                                Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana cremates Buddha
                                Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī and places the relics inside
                                eighty-four thousand stūpas and then burns his arm as an offering to
                                them. The other students are upset, but invoking the power of truth
                                his body becomes golden and his arm is restored. The Buddha states
                                that Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana was a previous life of
                                Bhaiṣajyarāja. He then proclaims how the offering of the body is the
                                greatest way to create merit and that a follower of the Mahāyāna
                                should burn a toe, finger, or a limb as an offering to a stūpa. He
                                describes through analogies how this sūtra is superior to all other
                                sūtras, and will bring many kinds of benefits. In particular,
                                devotion to this particular chapter will end rebirth as a woman and
                                bring rebirth in Sukhāvatī. The Buddha then entrusts the propagation
                                of this chapter to the bodhisattva
                                Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña.</p>

                            <p tid="91">The Buddha emits a light from his <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ūrṇā</foreign> hair that spreads through buddha
                                realms in the east and reaches Vairocana­raśmi­prati­maṇḍitā, in

                                bodhisattva Gadgadasvara. Gadgadasvara wishes to come to Sahā to see
                                Buddha Śākyamuni, enters samādhi, and many miraculous lotuses appear
                                on Vulture Peak. The Buddha explains to Mañjuśrī that this is a sign
                                of Gadgadasvara’s intention to come. Śākyamuni asks Buddha
                                Prabhūtaratna to cause him to come. Buddha Prabhūtaratna speaks
                                words inviting Gadgadasvara, who comes with quintillions of
                                bodhisattvas, makes an offering to Śākyamuni, and conveys
                                Kamala­dala­vimala­nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña’s respectful
                                inquiry as to Śākyamuni’s health, and so forth. The bodhisattva
                                Padmaśrī asks Śākyamuni about Gadgadasvara’s past. Śākyamuni
                                describes how in a previous life in the distant past, in the realm
                                Sarva­rūpa­saṃdarśanā, Gadgadasvara made <term type="ignore">extensive</term> offerings to Buddha Megha­dundubhi­svara­rāja,
                                and subsequently to countless buddhas, and how he has also taught
                                this very sūtra to beings in various divine and human forms through
                                the samādhi <distinct>manifestation of all forms</distinct>. Through
                                hearing the contents of this chapter a vast number of bodhisattvas
                                attained that samādhi, a lesser number attained receptivity to the

                                sūtra. Gadgadasvara and his accompanying bodhisattvas return to his
                                realm and relate to the buddha there what had occurred.</p>

                            <p tid="93">The bodhisattva Akṣayamati asks the Buddha what the name
                                “Avalokiteśvara” means. The Buddha replies by recounting how hearing
                                the name of Avalokiteśvara, and thinking of him, or calling out to
                                him, will save beings from all kinds of dangers, such as fire,
                                drowning, snakes, and violence. If someone pays homage to
                                Avalokiteśvara they will be freed from desire, anger, or ignorance.
                                A woman who does so will have an excellent son. The merit from
                                paying homage to him is equal to paying homage to countless buddhas.
                                Akṣayamati asks the Buddha about the activity of Avalokiteśvara, and
                                the Buddha states how he takes the form of various deities and
                                humans, buddhas, and bodhisattvas in various worlds so as to teach
                                the Dharma. Akṣayamati then offers a pearl necklace to
                                Avalokiteśvara, who then divides it into two and offers it to the
                                two buddhas present: Śākyamuni and Prabhūtaratna. Verses summarize
                                the prose with the addition of describing how Avalokiteśvara is the
                                attendant of Amitābha in Sukhāvatī. Then the bodhisattva
                                Dharaṇīṃdhara states that great merit is obtained by hearing this
                                chapter. Finally the sūtra describes how eighty-four thousand beings
                                developed the aspiration for enlightenment on hearing the Buddha
                                teach this chapter.</p>

                                asked their mother for permission to go and see the Buddha, but she
                                said as the king was a follower of brahmins he would not allow it.
                                Therefore they performed miracles that impressed the king so that
                                he, the queen, his court, and thousands of other beings came to see
                                this buddha who was teaching this very sūtra. The king gave up his
                                throne to his younger brother and he and all the others became
                                bhikṣus and bhikṣunīs. After eighty-four thousand years he attained
                                a samādhi so that he rose into the sky from where he spoke to the
                                Buddha of how his sons were realized beings and his teachers. The
                                Buddha explained that beings find teachers because of their past
                                merit. The king descended to the earth, paid homage to the Buddha’s
                                qualities and then returned back up into the sky. He and his queen
                                cast a string of pearls toward the Buddha as an offering that
                                transformed into a floating building of pearls within which the
                                Buddha sat. The Buddha prophesied the king’s attainment of
                                buddhahood. Then Śākyamuni explains that the bodhisattva Padmaśrī
                                was the king, the bodhisattva
                                Vairocana­raśmi­prati­maṇḍita­dhvaja­rāja was the queen, and the
                                bodhisattvas Bhaiṣajyarāja and Bhaiṣajya­samudgata were the two
                                sons. He says the world will pay homage to anyone who knows the
                                names of those two bodhisattvas. The chapter concludes by saying
                                that eighty-four thousand beings attained Dharma eyes through
                                listening to this very chapter.</p>

                            <p tid="97">The bodhisattva Samantabhadra with countless bodhisattvas
                                and beings come from an eastern world to the Buddha and request the
                                teaching of this sūtra, and the Buddha describes the four qualities
                                of a woman who will obtain this sūtra. Samantabhadra promises to
                                protect those who uphold the sūtra in the future from humans and
                                nonhumans. He will come mounted on an elephant to its practitioners
                                and reveal himself to them. And he gives a dhāraṇī that will bless
                                them, so that they will obtain the sūtra and that it will continue
                                to be preserved in the world. He describes the benefits of
                                dedication to the sūtra, which include being reborn in the
                                Trāyastriṃśa and Tuṣita paradises. He states that the holders of
                                this sūtra will have many good qualities and should be seen as
                                future buddhas and respected as buddhas, while those who disrespect
                                them will have various kinds of physical ailments and deformities.
                                The chapter concludes by saying that countless bodhisattvas attained
                                a great power of mental retention through listening to this very
                                chapter.</p>

                                promise to make it widespread. The Buddha gives his leave to all the
                                buddhas who had come from other worlds to depart, and Buddha
                                Prabhūtaratna and all other buddhas, bodhisattvas, and beings
                                rejoice and praise the Buddha’s teaching.</p>

                            “explain” or “elucidate.” Conversely, however, the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">ava­vadita</foreign> does not include

                                and Kern, as someone named Citradhvaja (who does not occur elsewhere
                                in this or any other sūtra) asking Akṣayamati the question. The
                                following verses are then Akṣayamati’s answers to Citradhvaja. This
                                is in contradiction to the preceding prose passage. In the presently
                                available Sanskrit neither <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">citradhvaja</foreign> nor <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">akṣayamati</foreign> is in the accusative case, but presumably

                                are the Buddha’s reply, as in the preceding prose. Therefore it
                                appears that the later translations are the result of a scribal
                                corruption in the Sanskrit. The Tibetan translation reads thus:
