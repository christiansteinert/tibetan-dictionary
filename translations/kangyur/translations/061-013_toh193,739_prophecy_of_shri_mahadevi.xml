                <p tid="1">This sūtra recounts an event that took place in the buddha realm of Sukhāvatī. The discourse commences
                    with Buddha Śākyamuni relating to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara the benefits of reciting the various names of Śrī
                    Mahādevī. The Buddha describes how Śrī Mahādevī acquired virtue and other spiritual accomplishments through
                    the practice of venerating numerous tathāgatas and gives an account of the prophecy in which her future
                    enlightenment was foretold by all the buddhas she venerated. The Buddha then lists the one hundred and eight
                    blessed names of Śrī Mahādevī to be recited by the faithful. The sūtra ends with Buddha Śākyamuni giving a
                        <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn"> dhāraṇī </foreign> and a brief explanation on the benefits of
                    reciting the names of Śrī Mahādevī, namely the eradication of all negative circumstances and the accumulation
                    of merit and happiness.</p>

                    <p tid="5">In this sūtra, Śrī Mahādevī cultivated her faith by venerating and chanting names of the
                        enlightened ones, thus accomplishing the roots of virtue that become the cause of her future awakening.
                        The narrative takes place in the buddha realm Sukhāvatī, where Buddha Śākyamuni explains to Bodhisattva
                        Avalokiteśvara the benefits of reciting Śrī Mahādevī’s names. He further explains how Śrī Mahādevī herself
                        gained the roots of virtue by venerating numerous tathāgatas, which the Buddha lists. He then relates the
                        prophecy of Śrī Mahādevī’s future enlightenment, bestowed upon her by those buddhas, and lists her one
                        hundred and eight names. The sūtra ends with Buddha Śākyamuni giving a <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dhāraṇī</foreign> and a brief explanation on how to practice the recitation of Śrī
                        Mahādevī’s names.</p>

                    <p tid="6">Most Kangyurs include two copies of the text, one (Toh 193) in the general sūtra (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mdo sde</foreign>) section and one (Toh 739) among the collected tantras
                            (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">rgyud ’bum</foreign>), classified under kriyātantra.<note place="end" index="2" xml:id="UT22084-061-013-7">The Tibetan copy in the tantra section of the Kangyur
                            (Toh 739) is followed by two short related texts, both also set in in Sukhāvatī and structured as
                            expositions by Buddha Śākyamuni to Avalokiteśvara: <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’phags pa dpal chen mo’i
                                mdo</title>, “The Sūtra of the Gorious Great [Goddess]” (Toh 740)—the goddess concerned being
                            identified as Lakṣmī in the Sanskrit title of the Degé version but not in all versions—and <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpal gyi lha mo’i mtshan bcu gnyis pa</title> “The Twelve Names of the Glorious
                            Goddess” (Toh 741). In both, the knowing, reciting, reading, and writing of the goddess’s twelve names
                            (almost but not exactly the same in both cases) and of short dhāraṇīs (different) are recommended as
                            effective means of dispelling obstacles and achieving goals. The colophons of both short texts state
                            that they were translated by Jinamitra and Yeshé Dé.</note> As neither copy of the Tibetan version has
                        a colophon, there is no information regarding the translators. However, it must have been translated in
                        the early period, since it is listed in the early 9th century Denkarma (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan dkar ma</foreign>) catalogue of texts translated into Tibetan from Sanskrit.
                        Versions of this sūtra in Sanskrit and Chinese are still extant today. The present translation appears to
                        be the first into a Western language. </p>

                    <p tid="7">The Degé edition of this sūtra was compared with various editions of the Tibetan canon, namely, the
                        Narthang, Kangxi and Lhasa editions, as well as with the Sanskrit of the Gilgit manuscript as edited by
                        Nalinaksa Dutt. The English translation has been made on the basis of the Tibetan, with a few exceptions
                        as indicated in the notes. The great many proper names contained in the sūtra are here given in Sanskrit,
                        but translations have been added in parentheses in the case of the “one hundred and eight names”—which
                        are, rather, epithets describing Mahādevī.</p>
