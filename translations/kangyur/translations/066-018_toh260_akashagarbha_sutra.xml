                <p tid="1">While the Buddha is dwelling on Khalatika Mountain with his retinue, an amazing display of light
                    appears, brought about by the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha’s liberating activities. As he joins the gathering,
                    Ākāśagarbha manifests another extraordinary display, and the Buddha, praising his inconceivable
                    accomplishments and activities, explains how to invoke his blessings. He sets out the <term>fundamental
                        transgressions</term> of rulers, ministers, śrāvakas, and beginner bodhisattvas, and, after explaining in
                    detail how to conduct the rituals of purification, encourages those who have committed such transgressions to
                    turn to Ākāśagarbha. When people pray to Ākāśagarbha, Ākāśagarbha adapts his manifestations to suit their
                    needs, appearing to them while they are awake, in their dreams, or at the time of their death. In this way,
                    Ākāśagarbha gradually leads them all along the path, helping them to purify their negative deeds, relieve
                    their sufferings, fulfill their wishes, and eventually attain perfect enlightenment.</p>

                    <p tid="4">Ākāśagarbha features among the so-called Eight Close Sons of the Buddha, who are regarded as the
                        principal bodhisattvas in the Buddha’s retinue, the other seven being Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Vajrapāṇi,
                        Kṣitigarbha, Sarva­nivaraṇa­viṣkambhin, Maitreya, and Samantabhadra. Each bodhisattva fulfills a
                        particular role for the benefit of beings, Ākāśagarbha’s being that of helping them to purify themselves
                        from the results of their negative actions.</p>

                    <p tid="5">The name Ākāśagarbha may be rendered in English as “Essence (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">garbha</foreign>)<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-018-273" index="1">The term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">garbha</foreign> can refer to different things, depending on the context. Womb,
                            embryo, heart, and essence are all possible translations. Historically, Tibetans opted for the
                            translation <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">snying po</foreign>, which has the connotation of being an
                            essence or the heart of a matter. For a discussion of this term see Zimmermann (2002), p 40-41.
                        </note> of Space (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ākāśa</foreign>).” To understand his name, it is useful to
                        consider the concept of space in Buddhist thought. In early Buddhist theory, space is non-obstruction, the
                        lack of matter allowing for the unhindered movement of the four great elements of earth, water, fire, and
                        air. Space is also non-obstructible due to its omnipresence and its eternal nature. Apart from being the
                        mere absence of obstruction, it is also counted as one of the three unconditioned dharmas or phenomena in
                        this world, the other two being the two types of cessation.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-018-274" index="2">
                            LVP (1923), p 7-8. </note> In the Pāli <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Mahāparinibbānasutta</title>,
                        space is presented as the actual foundation for all other elements of existence.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-018-275" index="3">See <ref target="https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html">www.accesstoinsight.org</ref>.</note> We can understand, therefore, the prominent position that
                        space holds among the elements of existence, and it is an equally prominent position that the bodhisattva
                        Ākāśagarbha holds among his peers, his presence outshining everything else in the world, everything except
                        the buddhas themselves. Just as space is the unlimited capacity to accommodate the entirety of phenomenal
                        existence, so Ākāśagarbha possesses countless inconceivable qualities to benefit sentient beings. As the
                        embodiment of non-obstruction, he helps beings remove obstacles from the path to awakening, in particular
                        the obstacles caused by their own misdeeds, by making them disclose their transgressions. </p>

                    <p tid="6">Due to his relation to space and the purification of negative deeds, Ākāśagarbha has become closely
                        associated with Buddha Vairocana, one of the principal figures in the Buddhist tantric traditions, whose
                        main function is the purification of negativities in general, and in particular those of the deceased. It
                        is particularly in the tantric traditions of China and Japan that Ākāśagarbha has become an important
                        figure of worship.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-018-276" index="4">For a discussion of

                            Chinese, see Tarchin and Lindmayer (2010). </note> Although the basic content of both texts is the
                        same, their structures are very different and the Chinese contains numerous passages not found in the

                            presents the measures to be taken to purify one’s negative deeds right after the explanation of the
                            first transgression, an explanation we do not find in this place in the Chinese version. </note> It is
                        justifiable, therefore, to speak of two different versions of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ākāśa­garbha­sūtra</title>. </p>

                        translations of some of its passages. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Śikṣāsamuccaya</title> by Śāntideva, of
                        which the Sanskrit has survived as well as its translation into Tibetan, quotes extensively from the

The extensive quotes from the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ākāśa­garbha­sūtra</title> found in the Tibetan version of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Śikṣā­samuccaya</title>, however, are not identical to the corresponding passages from the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ākāśa­garbha­sūtra</title> included in the Kangyur. As both translations were
                            produced around the same time, they were either prepared independently from each other, or the former
                            represents some kind of heavily revised edition of the latter. Interestingly, the editor-in-chief of
                            the translation of Śāntideva’s work was Yeshé Dé who, as mentioned above, also worked with

                        spiritual practice. It thus can be said to have a strong affinity with the so-called meditative
                        concentration Mahāyāna sūtras, of which the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Śūraṃgama­samādhi­sūtra</title> is a

                        and devotion to a bodhisattva as a means of purification. Because the principal activity of Ākāśagarbha,
                        as mentioned above, is the removal of obstructions on the path to awakening, followers are strongly
                        advised to generate pure faith in him. It is this faith, supported by the devotional practices of worship
                        and offering, that will invoke his presence and blessings. Once invoked, the bodhisattva will help
                        devotees according to their capacities and inclinations by first making them disclose their negative
                        actions.</p>

                        ones to remain with us, and dedicating all virtues to the benefit of sentient beings. </p>

                        Buddha? In this sūtra, the Buddha himself gives the answer to this question: they are the transgressions
                        (Tib. <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ltung ba</foreign>; Skt. <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">āpatti</foreign>), also referred to as <distinct>downfalls</distinct>. The so-called
                            <distinct>downfalls</distinct> are violations of vows or principles of conduct specific to different
                        kinds of Buddhist followers. In Buddhism, vows are forms of spiritual commitment taken to ensure steady
                        progress on the path. They are the “practical applications and outcomes of different Buddhist
                            theories.”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-018-285" index="13">Kongtrul Lodrö Tayé (2003), p
                            22.</note> Thus, transgressions are not actions judged as morally objectionable by some higher
                        authority; rather, they are actions of body, speech, and mind that result in a serious impediment on the
                        spiritual path of the one who commits them. They cause one to ‘fall from’ the path to awakening, so to
                        speak, and in the worst cases fall to the lower realms of existence. These transgressions need to be
                        disclosed and purified at the very outset of the path, and helping people do so is precisely the expertise
                        of Ākāśagarbha. </p>

                        of dream-inducing practice is for those who failed to meet Ākāśagarbha in the waking state to produce a

                    <p tid="18">Finally, another recurring theme throughout this sūtra is the use of <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dhāraṇīs</foreign>. This term has at least two distinct meanings in this text alone:
                        on the one hand, a mystical formula to be repeated with the aim of fulfilling certain worldly and
                        spiritual wishes, whether for oneself or others, and, on the other, a state of unfailing memory that
                        bodhisattvas attain on the higher levels of realization. But the mention of dhāraṇīs does not imply an
                        influence of tantric Buddhism on this text. Dhāraṇīs are used frequently in early Mahāyāna scriptures
                        predating the emergence of tantra in Buddhism.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-018-294" index="22">On

                        text, devotion being a skillful means on the path to awakening in Buddhism. The text was eminently
                        important in China and Japan, where the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha became a major figure of veneration, and
                        in the Tibetan tradition, where it served as a primary source for the list of bodhisattva transgressions.
                        The sūtra predates the emergence of the tantric Buddhist movement in India, but nevertheless contains
                        certain elements that gained in importance and were further developed in Vajrayāna Buddhism. </p>

                        the Peking and Narthang Kangyurs with the help of the comparative edition of the Kangyur (see <ptr target="#bibliography">bibliography</ptr>). Whenever confronted with problematic or difficult
                        passages, we discussed the variants with the Tibetan scholars we worked with to select the reading most

                        will be only one of the possible readings of the text. In this case, the task was rendered difficult by
                        the many obscure and somewhat esoteric verses the sūtra contains. With the resources at our disposal, we
                        have tried our best to understand and translate those lines; but the clarity we have aimed for in the
                        resulting English verses does not reflect the ambiguous nature of the Tibetan text, cryptic in many
                        places. We apologize for all instances where we did not do it justice. </p>

                        certain technical terms, is given in Sanskrit when we thought that no English rendering would convey the
                        exact meaning. The Tibetan version of the sūtra also contains a number of dhāraṇīs in transliterated
                        Sanskrit, and like the Tibetan translators we have left them as they are. In the process of trying to
                        reconstruct their most correct Sanskrit reading, we faced many problems despite the assistance of a
                        Sanskrit expert. Solving them would entail a separate research project, well beyond the scope of the
                        present translation work.</p>

                            translating from the Sanskrit, the cintāmaṇi is the main jewel appearing on Ākāśagarbha’s head: “At

                        spread out and surrounded it. <ref cRef="F.264.b"/> The light of that precious jewel rendered invisible
                        the totality of manifest form in the whole trichiliocosm. Thus, with the exception of the tathāgatas, all
                        gods and humans, śrāvakas, and bodhisattvas, as well as the manifest forms of the great elements of earth,
