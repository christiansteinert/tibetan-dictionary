                    <title xml:lang="en">The Absorption That Encapsulates All Merit</title> tells the story of Vimalatejā, a
                    strongman renowned for his physical prowess, who visits the Buddha in order to compare abilities and prove
                    that he is the mightier of the two. He receives an unexpected, humbling riposte in the form of a teaching by
                    the Buddha on the inconceivable magnitude of the powers of awakened beings, going well beyond mere physical
                    strength. The discussions that then unfold—largely between the Buddha, Vimalatejā, and the bodhisattva
                    Nārāyaṇa—touch on topics including the importance of creating merit, the centrality of learning and insight,
                    and the question of whether renunciation entails monasticism. Above all, however, Vimalatejā is led to see
                    that the entirety of the Great Vehicle path hinges on the practice that forms the name of the sūtra, which is
                    nothing other than the mind of awakening (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">bodhicitta</foreign>). </p>

                    <p tid="4"> Like a number of other Great Vehicle sūtras, <title xml:lang="en">The Absorption That Encapsulates
                            All Merit</title> consists of a rich and at times disjointed amalgam of stories, teachings, and
                        conversations. Although the sūtra begins in a seemingly historical setting in the vicinity of Vaiśālī, in
                        the course of the narration we travel throughout our world system in times past, present, and future, as
                        well as other world systems presided over by their respective awakened beings. Beginning in the voice of a
                        general narrator who returns to describe supernatural events from a bird’s-eye view—earthquakes, cascading
                        flowers, flashes of light, and the like—the text for the most part unfolds as a discussion, and thus
                        emerges from the mouths of a cast of characters with whom we are gradually acquainted. Some of these
                        characters are familiar: the Buddha, of course, and bodhisattvas like Mañjuśrī and Nārāyaṇa, as well as
                        the śrāvakas Maudgalyāyana and Ānanda, who make brief guest appearances in what is largely a Great Vehicle
                        ensemble. </p>
                    <p tid="5">The central plot surrounds the conversion and awakening of a newcomer, a “strongman” named
                        Vimalatejā. The sūtra’s structure is framed loosely around an instruction by the Buddha that successfully
                        converts Vimalatejā, and this instruction is the basis for the sūtra’s name. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-002-4"/>
                    <p tid="6">The text commences in a typical way, with the description of a setting in India—a mansion in
                            <term>Āmrapālī</term>’s grove in the area of Vaiśālī, where the Buddha is residing with his entourage
                        of countless human and nonhuman beings. The Buddha gives a teaching that is not spelled out in the text,
                        but which apparently is impressive enough to prompt Nārāyaṇa to rise up and praise its orator. Nārāyaṇa,
                        who will serve as the major interlocutor for the remainder of the text, then exhorts the Buddha to expound
                        further; first he presents a series of supplications to the Buddha, and subsequently a series of
                        questions. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-002-5"/>
                    <p tid="7">The supplications are noteworthy in that aside from purely soteriologically oriented prayers, they
                        also include prayers for the preservation and sustained high reputation of the Buddhist community,
                        indicating concerns from within the tradition about the place of Buddhists within society. The
                        twenty-three questions that follow effectively span the entirety of what is involved in bodhisattva
                        praxis. As a response to Nārāyaṇa’s extensive list of questions, the Buddha hints at a teaching that would
                        constitute a complete answer to each and every one of Nārāyaṇa’s inquiries, and this teaching provides the
                        sūtra’s name. Although the Buddha says nothing more about the teaching at this point, the exchange grounds
                        the text thematically in the topic of merit, suggesting as it does that the entire bodhisattva spiritual
                        path stands and falls with it. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-002-6"/>
                    <p tid="8">The setting of the narrative then changes from <term>Āmrapālī</term>’s grove to a nearby place in
                        the town of Vaiśālī, where the sūtra’s chief protagonist, Vimalatejā, is dwelling. Through the omnipresent
                        narrator, we zoom in on this strongman as he is indulging in a bout of self-aggrandizement concerning his
                        stature as a strong and powerful human being. He almost comes to the conclusion that there could be no one
                        mightier than him in the world, before he remembers having heard of a special person named Gautama.
                        Gautama is of course said to possess the ten strengths of an awakened being, which, if true, would
                        certainly eclipse the merely physical and worldly might that Vimalatejā possesses. So he resolves to visit
                        the Buddha to clear away his doubts. This sets up another major theme of the text, a playful inquiry into
                        what it really means to be “strong.” </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-002-7"/>
                    <p tid="9">On this note, the story segues back to the Buddha’s encampment in <term>Āmrapālī</term>’s grove,
                        where Vimalatejā arrives with his nose in the air. Noticing Vimalatejā’s presence and haughty attitude,
                        the Buddha ventures into a lengthy, rather pertinent dialogue on the topic of power; although this
                        discussion is carried out with Maudgalyāyana, it is directed entirely at Vimalatejā. The discussion
                        consists of a set of progressively more astounding comparative descriptions that reveal the inimitable
                        quality of the buddhas’ and bodhisattvas’ power which, as we—and Vimalatejā—come to see, is literally
                        unrivalled in the world. Humbled and inspired to expand the scope of his own strength, which he had
                        previously thought to be matchless, Vimalatejā then takes refuge in the Three Jewels and forms the resolve
                        of a bodhisattva. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-002-8"/>
                    <p tid="10">This leads us back to where the previous scene left off, before it was interrupted by the arrival
                        of the self-inflated visitor. Nārāyaṇa, the interlocutor, returns to the questions he had asked the
                        Buddha, and reminds him that he had not yet explained exactly what was referred to by the term
                            <distinct>the absorption that encapsulates all merit</distinct>. The Buddha graciously bestows a
                        reply, at which point we discover that the term refers to nothing other than the mind of awakening
                            (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">bodhicitta</foreign>). </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-002-9"/>
                    <p tid="11">The Buddha’s explanation then takes the form of four “introductions” to the topic at hand. These
                        consist of another set of characteristically mind-boggling, evocative comparisons that build up to the
                        conclusion that nothing—even within the powers of the gods Śakra and Brahma—could truly be more
                        meritorious than engendering the mind of awakening. This effectively makes a link in very simple terms (it
                        is fair to say that this sūtra is addressed to, and comprehended by, nonspecialists) between power, merit,
                        and the bodhisattva endeavor. After a series of miracles, at which a huge portion of the audience forms
                        the resolve set on awakening, an apparent first chapter comes to a close—apparent because, although all
                        Kangyurs contain at this point the mention of a first chapter being concluded, some catalogues state that
                        this may be an error of transcription with no thematic significance, corresponding as it does with a
                        change of fascicles. No mention is made of subsequent chapters, as would usually be the case.<note place="end" index="1" xml:id="UT22084-056-002-366">The catalogue of the Narthang Kangyur (F.94a) says
                            that the Tshalpa (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">tshal pa</foreign>) catalogue lists this text
                            as having two chapters (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">le’u</foreign>), but that the Great
                            Fifth Dalai Lama considered this to be a scribal error. Neverheless, the 16th century Tibetan
                            commentator Pekar Zangpo (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">pad dkar bzang po</foreign>, p 193) does identify
                            a thematic distinction, writing that the first chapter deals with the nature of the absorption while
                            the second explains its causes and the benefits of training in it. Curiously, however, both the
                            Narthang and Degé catalogues also list the text as having no less than 50 <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">le’u</foreign>. It may be that in this and similar catalogue entries (see also
                            Dharmachakra 2016, Introduction I.15) the term <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">le’u</foreign>
                            is being used to denote “episodes” or “scenes,” rather than in its more usual sense of formal sections
                            or chapters.</note>

                    <p tid="12">Chapter 2, or the second fascicle, begins with a long dialogue between the Buddha and Vimalatejā,
                        in which the Buddha sets out to elaborate further on the principle of merit and how it is accumulated.
                        This discussion centers around three practices identified by the Buddha as being ideal for the
                        accumulation of merit: generosity, discipline, and learning. These provide a systematic framework for the
                        expression of numerous Buddhist ethical and soteriological principles, and thus this passage could be said
                        to be the weightiest in terms of religious doctrine. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-002-11"/>
                    <p tid="13">Although the ideas within this passage are presented in fairly straightforward terms and largely
                        in the form of mnemonic lists, they also extend beyond mere ethical behavior and delve into the Great

                        of things. Bodhisattvas are exhorted, for instance, to become free of dualism, and such a nonconceptual
                        mind-state will allow them to practice generosity with their own bodies. This is compared, in an evocative
                        simile, to the way a tree allows its parts to be taken for various uses. This emphasis on insight will
                        later be reinforced by the Buddha’s categorical statement that learning is the most crucial of the three
                        endeavors. </p>

                    <p tid="14">Prior to this, however, the section on the accumulation of learning in chapter 2 is noteworthy in
                        that it provides another layer in both the plotline and thematic content of the sūtra. This occurs when
                        the Buddha recounts a story from his past life as Great Supreme Sage, who sacrificed his own body in order
                        to receive spiritual instruction. The recitation of this selfless action is potent enough to summon
                        Immaculately Renowned King, a buddha from an entirely different world system, who proceeds to expound,
                        coincidentally, on the teaching known as <distinct>the absorption that encapsulates all merit</distinct>.
                        Thus is introduced another major theme of the text, namely the importance of undergoing hardship for the
                        sake of the Dharma. </p>

                    <p tid="15">The remainder of Buddha Immaculately Renowned King’s sermon is made up of another short set of
                        mnemonic lists. After recounting these, the Buddha then articulates the moral of the story regarding the
                        importance of fortitude in pursuing the Dharma, while also making an interesting comment about the
                        presence of “Dharma treasures” hidden in various “mountains, mountain caverns, and trees,” which are
                        awaiting revelation. </p>

                    <p tid="16">The Buddha then concludes the general discussion on the three practices, identifying learning as
                        the most crucial practice. The conversation between Vimalatejā and the Buddha, which is now firmly
                        grounded in the topic of insight and its pursuit, then turns to the notion of “acceptance that phenomena
                        are unborn” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">anutpattika­dharma­kṣānti</foreign>) and what leads to
                        it. This could be said to be the buildup to the major turning point in the sūtra’s storyline: at the
                        conclusion of the discussion, Vimalatejā has an epiphany that leads him to levitate high up in the air,
                        which in turn induces the Buddha to display a cosmic smile that illuminates the universe. Afterward the
                        Buddha, prompted by Ānanda, relates the key moments in Vimalatejā’s past lives that brought him to where
                        he is now, and furthermore prophesies Vimalatejā’s future awakening. </p>

                    <p tid="17">The arc of the story then segues again as Vimalatejā makes his debut as a teacher in response to a
                        series of questions by Nārāyaṇa. In his answers, Vimalatejā demonstrates a remarkable, sudden penetration
                        of profound Buddhist ideas, carrying the course of the discussion into the nature of nonduality and the
                        imminence of awakened qualities within all beings. He is even led by Nārāyaṇa to comment on several
                        challenging statements from other sūtras, such as the line, “Rely on the true meaning; do not rely on the
                        words.” Vimalatejā answers these questions with ease and is commended by the Buddha. A conversation
                        between Nārāyaṇa and Mañjuśrī now follows, in which the latter expounds on similar themes. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-002-16"/>
                    <p tid="18">The final section shifts into a loose, communal atmosphere of shared insights, as various
                        characters, including several new ones, chime in whenever they are inspired to make comments. First a god
                        named Free of Demons delivers an oration that is notable for its exhortation that bodhisattvas should
                        engage in seemingly unethical practices as part of their spiritual endeavor—even “demonic” ones—if they
                        can do so without being polluted by them. This sets the stage for a long string of abstract and often
                        paradoxical statements regarding bodhisattva practice that come in turn from the mouths of the Buddha,
                        Mañjuśrī, and others. Mañjuśrī later makes a comment on the irrelevance of monasticism to the bodhisattva
                        endeavor, reiterating that true insight should be regarded as the decisive factor as to whether or not a
                        bodhisattva is considered a “renunciant.” This would seem to suggest that the sūtra’s expected audience
                        may indeed have consisted of—or at least included—laypeople. It also suggests that the sūtra emerged from
                        a milieu in which lay spirituality was encouraged and considered respectable. Finally the text concludes
                        with an explanation by the Buddha on the way in which merit creates what are known as the <distinct>marks
                            of one hundred merits</distinct>, as well as his announcement that his life will soon end. </p>

                        relatively simplified sampling of the rich philosophy and atmosphere of Great Vehicle Buddhism, while at
                        the same time constituting a literary work that functions on several levels. On the narrative level, it is
                        the story of a seemingly uneducated outsider named Vimalatejā, who has a spiritual awakening and then
                        impresses the Buddhist establishment. On another level, it is a commentary on the nature of human power
                        and merit, which we progressively come to see are rooted in insight. It also displays evidence from within
                        the Buddhist tradition that its adherents were concerned about the preservation and positive reputation of
                        their cultural institution. All of this unfolds in <term>Āmrapālī</term>’s grove near Vaiśālī where the
                        Buddha timelessly dwells, and the Great Vehicle teachings emerge in constant revelation. </p>

                        himself, “I am someone who has the great strength that comes with being a mighty and powerful strongman.
                        Among the beings in this world, there does not seem to be anyone who rivals me in power or vigor, so who
                        could be superior to me, I wonder?” </p>
                    <p tid="35">He continued to ponder, “The monk Gautama is said to have a great deal of power. It is said that
                        his power consists of the ten strengths, and that he has a body like that of Nārāyaṇa.” He then thought,
                        “I should go find this monk Gautama. <ref cRef="F.73.a"/> That way I can really make a comparison of this
                        ‘Blessed One’ and myself, and resolve my doubts.” </p>

                        with which the Buddha taught the Dharma. In his magnificent beauty the Buddha seemed like the lofty king
                        of mountains in the midst of the ocean, and Vimalatejā could not stop looking at him. As soon as he laid
                        eyes on the Blessed One, he felt pleased, delighted, and overjoyed. In this state, he touched the Blessed
                        One’s feet, circled him, and then sat off to one side. He bowed—though to the Blessed One only—and with
                        his palms together at his head, sat there with his attention on the Blessed One. </p>

                        understanding. With understanding, one pursues the Dharma in the correct way. When one exerts oneself in

                        to lead to the genuine view of the noble ones.’ He then continued to wonder, ‘So where does the genuine

                        this way are indeed carrying out bodhisattva practice. They will also swiftly receive their prophecy.
                        Mañjuśrī, I know this clearly. Previously, during the time of the Thus-Gone One Dīpaṃkara, there was no

                        apprehending manner. But then, when I met the Thus-Gone One, the foe-destroyer, the completely perfect
                        Buddha Dīpaṃkara, I transcended all practices. Just upon seeing him, and witnessing the Blessed One’s
                        conduct, I attained that conduct as well, and realized the fact that all phenomena are inherently unborn.
                        It was on this occasion that the Blessed Thus-Gone One Dīpaṃkara prophesied, ‘In the future, you will be
                        the thus-gone one, the foe-destroyer, the completely perfect buddha Śākyamuni.’ It was at this time, too,

                        with any phenomena. Acceptance is so called because it is not just momentary, in terms of the
                        characteristics of all phenomena and their apprehension. This acceptance has nothing whatsoever that can
                        be considered to do with the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind. It has nothing to do with pretense.
                        Not only is it unending, that acceptance also has no end. Not only does that acceptance have no object, it
                        is also not without an object. That is why it is called acceptance.” </p>
