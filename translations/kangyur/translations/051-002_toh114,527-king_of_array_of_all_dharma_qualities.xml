                    outside Rājagṛha, where the Buddha is residing in the Bamboo Grove together with a great assembly of monks, 
                    bodhisattvas, and other human and non-human beings. At the request of the bodhisattvas Vajrapāṇi and Avalokiteśvara, 
                    the Buddha teaches his audience on a selection of brief but disparate topics belonging to the general Mahāyāna 
                    tradition: how to search for a spiritual friend and live in solitude, the benefits of venerating Avalokiteśvara’s 
                    name, the obstacles that Māra may create for practitioners, and warnings on how easy it is to lose one’s 
                    determination to be free from saṃsāra. The sūtra also includes two dhāraṇīs that the Buddha and Vajrapāṇi teach 
                    in turn, along with details of their benefits and Vajrapāṇi’s ritual recitation instructions. Throughout the 
                    text, the Buddha repeatedly insists on the importance and benefits of venerating and propagating this teaching as 
                    well as those who teach it. </p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The King of the Array of All Dharma Qualities</title> is a scripture found in both the general sūtra and the tantra sections of most Kangyurs. The sūtra is set in the Bamboo Grove at Kalanda­kanivāpa, a park outside Rājagṛha where several sūtras are said to have been taught. Here, the Buddha resides together with a great saṅgha of monks and with several bodhisattvas. The Buddha enters a state of meditative absorption, whereby the earth shakes, and various supernatural manifestations appear. At the sight of these magical displays, many other beings are attracted to the place where the Buddha is about to teach and, joining those already present, they listen. The bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi then supplicates the Buddha to teach the sūtra called <title xml:lang="en">The King of the Array of All Dharma Qualities</title>.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-051-002-4"/>
                    <p tid="4">After the Buddha has instructed the audience on the four proper attitudes for finding a spiritual friend, Avaloki­teśvara tells the audience that those who hear this Dharma teaching will be blessed by all the buddhas and will be reborn in Sukhāvatī. At the request of Vajrapāṇi, the Buddha then explains the significance of Avaloki­teśvara’s name. Next, the Buddha and Vajrapāṇi successively utter two powerful dhāraṇīs for the benefit of those present in the assembly. Vajrapāṇi accompanies the recitation of his dhāraṇī with the description of a ritual featuring the maṇḍalas of Vajradhara, Śākyamuni, and Avaloki­teśvara.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-051-002-5"/>
                    <p tid="5">In the remainder of the sūtra, the Buddha entrusts his teaching to Vajrapāṇi and the rest of the audience, repeatedly insisting that this text and those who teach it should be regarded as thus-gone ones themselves. The benefits derived from worshiping and propagating this teaching and its teachers are then repeatedly presented to the assembly. The Buddha concludes his discourse by explaining the unfortunate consequences of not persevering in the Dharma but instead relapsing into saṃsāric pursuits. He illustrates this with three analogies: (1) a woman who forgets the difficulty of childbirth and allows herself to become pregnant again; (2) a man who has recovered from his drunkenness yet quickly returns to his old habits; and (3) a being who escapes hell and is born as a human, only to engage in the very actions that lead straight back to hell. Having warned his audience about the dire outcomes of such careless attitudes, the Buddha provides Ānanda with five alternative titles for this sūtra, and the entire world with its human and non-human beings rejoices and praises the teaching.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-051-002-6"/>
                    <p tid="6">The Buddha’s main interlocutors in this sūtra are the bodhisattvas Vajrapāṇi and Avaloki­teśvara. The bodhisattva Vyūharāja, “King of the Array,” plays only a minor role, and the fact that the title includes the words that make up his name does not seem likely to be due to his presence in the cast of characters. On the other hand, the relationship between the content of the sūtra and its title (which is repeated at several points within the text) remains unclear. The content is generally heterogeneous, but it is noteworthy that it contains two dhāraṇīs and descriptions of a ritual. The presence of these ritual elements in a Mahāyāna teaching is probably the reason why this text is included twice in the Degé and other Kangyurs with Tshalpa influence, appearing not only in the General Sūtra section (as Toh 114) but also in the section of Action tantras (as Toh 527). In Kangyurs more closely aligned to the Thempangma tradition, the text appears only in the Action tantra section. <ref key="toh527">(Readers who select this text from the tantra section, as Toh 527, will see that there are two sets of folio reference marks in the text, because in later printings of the Degé Kangyur an additional text was inserted early in this particular volume, displacing most of the subsequent texts by 17 folios. As the computer input Tibetan text of the Kangyur currently used in the Reading Room is based on a later printing, only the second folio reference in each set is linked to the Tibetan text display.)</ref>

                    <p tid="7">The sūtra was translated into both Chinese and Tibetan. The Chinese translation (T.1374) was produced by the famous Chinese pilgrim Yijing (635–713) at the beginning of the eighth century, while the Tibetan translation rendered here in English was prepared a century later by the prolific Tibetan translator Yeshé Dé (fl. eighth to ninth centuries) in collaboration with the Indian paṇḍitas Prajñāvarman and Surendrabodhi. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-051-002-212"/>
                    <p tid="7">In both early ninth century inventories of translated texts, the Denkarma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan dkar ma</foreign>) and Phangthangma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’phang thang ma</foreign>), a text with this title is listed as having six <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bam po</foreign> (fascicles), which would make it at least ten times longer than the present text. The Phangthangma additionally lists another text with the same name, but with four hundred ślokas, which would correspond more closely to the sūtra translated here. Butön (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bu ston rin chen grub</foreign>), in his fourteenth century canonical list that was an important influence in the compilation of the Kangyur, ascribes six <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bam po</foreign> to a text with this title, too,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-051-002-208" index="1">Butön, F.148.b</note> and then a few folios later goes on to mention another text with this same title, but of only four hundred ślokas, among thirty-six texts that he had not found.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-051-002-209" index="2">Butön, F.153.b</note> Although there may have been errors in the inventories,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-051-002-211" index="3">The index of the Narthang Kangyur (though difficult to read clearly), after stating that the text has four hundred ślokas, opines that “although in the early inventories, including Butön’s, it is said to have six <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bam po</foreign>, later generations mention [this lower figure] on the basis of examination” (F.92.b: <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bu sogs dkar chag sngon ma rnams su bam po drug ces gsung na’ang phyi rabs rnams dpyad gzhir mdzad do</foreign>).</note> it is not easy to mistake a six <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bam po</foreign> text for a four hundred śloka one, and it remains a possibility that two texts of very different length but the same title co-existed at some time. The fact that it is the longer of the two whose existence Butön seems to confirm, and not the shorter, adds to the uncertainty. Nevertheless, no trace of a longer version has come to light. The versions found in the Tabo and Gondhla proto-Kangyur collections appear to be different Tibetan translations of the same original.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-051-002-210"/>
                    <p tid="7">It is hard to evaluate the influence of this sūtra on the wider tradition. Compared to some of the other texts with which it is placed (in most Kangyurs) in the first thirty or so works of the General Sūtra section, it does not seem to have had a significant impact—unlike, for example, <title xml:lang="en">The White Lotus of the Good Dharma</title> immediately preceding it and <title xml:lang="en">The Display of the Pure Land of Sukhāvatī</title> that follows. In contrast to its much-cited neighbours with predominant doctrinal themes, it has not been the focus of any specific practice or tradition, and it is not immediately obvious which of its relatively brief and quite disparate statements might at one time have been most valued. The few citations in later literature that we have identified do not collectively focus on one of its topics in particular.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-051-002-206" index="4">The great translator Kawa Paltsek (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ska ba dpal brtsegs</foreign>, eighth to ninth century) cites the brief passage on how a bodhisattva should live in solitude (<ptr target="#UT22084-051-002-34"/>) in a work included in the Tengyur (Toh 4357), his <title xml:lang="en">Account of the Precious Scriptures and the Śākya Lineage</title> (see bibliography, folio 249.a). The citation, or perhaps paraphrase, is closer to the proto-Kangyur version (see <ptr target="#UT22084-051-002-17"/>) than to the Degé version translated here. Later in the same text (folios 327.a – 328.b), he then quotes the entire passage on the two dhāraṇīs (<ptr target="#UT22084-051-002-44"/> to <ptr target="#UT22084-051-002-65"/>), followed without a break by the earlier passage on the reasons for Avalokiteśvara’s name (<ptr target="#UT22084-051-002-40"/> to <ptr target="#UT22084-051-002-219"/>). The fourteenth century Nyingma master Longchen Rabjam uses, several times in his <title xml:lang="en">Treasury of Wishfulfilling Jewels</title>, citations from a text he calls <title xml:lang="en">The Noble Sūtra King of the Array of Qualities</title> (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’phags pa yon tan bkod pa’i mdo</title>), two of which include—verbatim from this present sūtra—all or some of the three sets of four deeds of Māra (<ptr target="#UT22084-051-002-69"/> to <ptr target="#UT22084-051-002-74"/>), but another speaks of the qualities of a spiritual friend in lines not found in this sūtra. The eighteenth century editor of the Degé Tengyur, Tsultrim Rinchen (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">tshul khrims rin chen</foreign>), cites the passage on the benefits of contemplating Avalokiteśvara’s name.</note> Nevertheless, the most sustained message of the sūtra—that respect, worship, and preservation of the sūtra itself will bring immense spiritual benefits, including rebirth in Sukhāvatī—carries reflections of both <title xml:lang="en">The White Lotus of the Good Dharma</title> and <title xml:lang="en">The Display of the Pure Land of Sukhāvatī</title>, and is perhaps a sufficient explanation of its presence in many Kangyurs between these two texts.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-051-002-221" index="5">A very small possibility remains that it was the hypothetical much longer text with the same title, mentioned above in <ptr target="#UT22084-051-002-212"/>, that was designated by Butön and his successors for this position, and that the present sūtra was at some point in the Tshalpa lineage duplicated from the tantra section to take its place. </note>

                    <p tid="8">Significantly, a Sanskrit palm leaf manuscript was discovered in Gilgit in 1938 among numerous other Buddhist texts (Hinüber 1979 and Hartmann 1997). Dr. Oliver von Criegern of the University of Munich has produced an edition of this Sanskrit manuscript, as well as an edition of the Tibetan text (including proto-Kangyur manuscripts from Tabo and Gondhla) and a full translation into German that we consulted during the translation to resolve several difficult passages (Criegern 2009). While we consulted the Sanskrit edition during our work, this translation mainly follows the Tibetan Degé woodblock print. However, in a few instances where the Tibetan seems corrupt and the Sanskrit offers the more sensible reading, we have followed the Sanskrit edition. Significant differences from the proto-Kangyur manuscripts are recorded in endnotes. The dhāraṇīs are transcribed according to the Degé edition; the Sanskrit is also provided in endnotes, together with tentative translations.</p>

Eventually, I gave away my arms, legs, eyes, and head, as well as my beloved sons, spouses, and daughters. I gave away my marrow and my bones, my homes, my villages, my towns, my cities, my countries, and my royal palaces. For hundreds of thousands of years I observed celibacy, stayed away from households, and never enjoyed kingdoms, wealth, countries, palaces, retinues, sons, daughters, or spouses. I was entirely celibate, and only performed acts of generosity. I focused only on worshiping and serving the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha. I continuously honored, respected, worshiped, and venerated those who taught the Dharma, offering them flowers, incense, perfumes, flower garlands, ointments, powders, clothes, parasols, <ref cRef="F.193.b" key="toh114" type="folio"/> victory banners, and flags. I served many spiritual friends, and with weariness toward saṃsāra, offered my own body, eyes, flesh, <ref key="toh527">[F.66.b]</ref> <ref cRef="F.83.b" key="toh527" type="folio"/> marrow, bones, and skin—not to mention all the outer material things—without ever feeling any regret.”</p>

They will experience much suffering, hundreds of types of suffering. As an analogy, consider a pregnant woman. When her baby boy or girl is forming in her womb during the different stages of the pregnancy—from the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth month all the way until the birth of the child—the mother’s body is taken over by the baby. Her joints are pushed apart, she loses her appetite, and her voice becomes weak. She carries the baby while experiencing the pain of these oppressive physical sensations. Until the baby is born, she experiences the suffering of the hell beings, and thinks, ‘After I give birth to my child, if everything goes well, I will become celibate forever!’ Later, however, excited by desire for sensual pleasures, she will forget all that suffering, and only think of pleasure.</p>

They will be reborn among the hell realms, the animal realms, or in the world of the Lord of Death. <ref cRef="F.194.b" key="toh114" type="folio"/> Intoxicated by desire, they will encourage their emotions, thinking, ‘I have to look after my household, my family, my spouse, my sons, and my daughters.’ When they are reborn in the hell realms, they will feel regret. Afterward, however, once liberated from those hellish states, they will be excited by desire and forget the suffering they endured in the hell realms, and will neither engage in generosity nor maintain their discipline. </p>

They do not think about their parents, spouse, sons, or daughters. They do not remember the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha. Intoxicated like this, they become fearless. Even if they pass by a charnel ground, they think, ‘What god, nāga, or yakṣa can frighten me!’ They perceive mats made of dirt, wood, grass, or thorns as comfortable beds. Later, however, when they recover and awaken from their drunkenness and regain their senses, they feel remorse about their conduct and think, ‘Even at the cost of my life, I will never drink liquor again!’ ” </p>

They do not remember to be generous. They do not strive to be reborn among the higher realms, as a king, or in the buddha realms. These beings will circle in saṃsāra, experiencing the suffering of being reborn among the hell realms, the animal realms, or in the World of the Lord of Death. <ref cRef="F.195.a" key="toh114" type="folio"/> They think, ‘I’m healthy; I’m not suffering.’ However, when these beings are liberated from the hell realms, the animal realms, and the World of the Lord of Death and take rebirth in a human body that is so difficult to obtain, their body becomes weary from the physical torments and the darkness endured while in the womb. Weary of soaking in blood and bile, phlegm, excrement, and filth, they think, ‘I have circled in saṃsāra for a hundred years, an eon, a hundred eons, a thousand eons, a hundred thousand eons. I have experienced all these unbearable, horrible, painful sensations. I wonder what previous actions caused all these awful situations? <ref key="toh527">[F.68.a]</ref> <ref cRef="F.85.a" key="toh527" type="folio"/> It must be due to my many evil deeds in the past!’ Even being in the womb produces similar regrets as those produced by the experience in the hells. So they promise themselves, ‘Once I am liberated from this hell-like womb, I will seek out the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha with undivided faith. I will by all means avoid this hell-like experience of the womb!’ In spite of this, once they are liberated from the womb, they nevertheless continue to act carelessly and experience the suffering of the hell realms all over again. Therefore, never act carelessly!” </p>
