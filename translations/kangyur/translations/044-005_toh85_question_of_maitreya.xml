                <p tid="1">In <title xml:lang="en">The Question of Maitreya</title>, the bodhisattva Maitreya asks the Buddha what
                    qualities a bodhisattva needs to attain enlightenment quickly. The Buddha outlines several sets of qualities,
                    foremost among them the altruistic intention of perfect bodhicitta. The Buddha then recounts to Ānanda how, in
                    a former life, Maitreya revered a previous Buddha and, wishing to become just like him, at once realized that
                    all phenomena are unproduced. Ānanda asks why Maitreya did not become a buddha sooner, and in answer the
                    Buddha compares Maitreya’s bodhisattva career with his own, listing further sets of qualities that
                    differentiate them and recounting examples of the hardships he himself faced in previous lives. Maitreya, on
                    the other hand, has followed the easy bodhisattva vehicle using its skillful means, such as the seven branch
                    practice and the training in the six perfections; the aspirations he thus made are set out in the famous
                    “Prayer of Maitreya” for which this sūtra is perhaps best known. The Buddha declares that Maitreya will become
                    enlightened when sentient beings have fewer negative emotions, in contrast to the ignorant and turbulent
                    beings he himself vowed to help. </p>

                        its entry, and its path are described as “easy,” in contrast to the difficulties encountered by the Buddha
                        himself. His hardship is detailed in a passage that is unusual for its portrayal of the harsh rejection of
                        the Buddha and his teachings by some of his contemporaries.</p>

                    <p tid="7">The sūtra’s stories of the Buddha’s great sacrifices in three of his former lives derive from
                        earlier Jātaka literature. Although influential to some extent in forming the ideal of the bodhisattva,
                        such supreme heroic acts were doubtless too daunting for most people. The reader is led to infer that by
                        following the example of Maitreya future bodhisattvas will be able to attain enlightenment with relative
                        ease. Thus, the sūtra implicitly promotes the Mahāyāna, without devaluing earlier Buddhist traditions.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-044-005-7"/>
                    <p tid="8">The sūtra is probably best known for an aspiration prayer in verse that, the Buddha tells Ānanda,
                        was used by Maitreya six times daily as he was training on the bodhisattva path (F.114.a–F.115.a, see
                        milestones <ptr target="#UT22084-044-005-77"/><!-- 1.67-->–<ptr target="#UT22084-044-005-100"/><!--1.90-->). This prayer is widely known as <title xml:lang="en">The Prayer of Maitreya</title> (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">byams pa’i smon lam</title>) or <title xml:lang="en">The Sovereign Prayer of
                            Maitreya</title> (<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Maitreya­praṇidhana­rāja</title>, <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">byams pa’i smon lam gyi rgyal po</title>); at least in Tibetan Buddhism, its importance as a general
                        Mahāyāna aspiration prayer is perhaps second only to Samantabhadra’s <title xml:lang="en">Prayer of Good
                            Action</title> (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bzang spyod smon lam</title>, from the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Gaṇḍavyūhasūtra</title>), and it is recited daily in many monasteries. The verses
                        are also found as an independent text (but with this sūtra mentioned in the colophon as their source) both
                        in the Dhāraṇī section of the Kangyur (Toh 1096), and in the Tengyur (Toh 4378). Although no Indian
                        commentaries on this prayer are known, it seems to have been recognized as a distinct feature of the sūtra
                        at least as far back as the early translation period, as evidenced by the sūtra’s description in the
                        Phangthangma catalogue (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dkar chag ’phang thang ma</title>) as “the longer <title xml:lang="en">Noble [Sūtra] of the Question of Maitreya</title> containing the aspiration” (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’phags pa byams pas zhus pa chen po smon lam can</title>). It is also, presumably,
                        the “Former Prayer that is Truly Noble” that the Buddha gives Ānanda as an alternative title for the sūtra
                        (see 1.95). The prayer is the topic of several commentaries in the Tibetan literature, notably those of
                        Shākya Chokden (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">shA kya mchog ldan</foreign>, 1428-1507); Drukpa Padma Karpo
                            (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’brug pa pad ma dkar po</foreign>, 1527-1592); Tāranātha (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">tA ra nA tha</foreign>, 1575-1634), who adds comments on the significance of the
                        whole sūtra; Choné Trakpa Shedrup (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">co ne grags pa bshad sgrub</foreign>,

                    <p tid="9">It is difficult to determine the precise historical relationship of <title xml:lang="en">The
                            Question of Maitreya</title> with the much shorter sūtra that follows it, <title xml:lang="en">The
                            Question of Maitreya on the Eight Qualities</title> (Toh 86). Their themes are closely linked—in both,
                        Maitreya questions the Buddha about the bodhisattvas’ qualities. However, their geographic settings
                            differ: <title xml:lang="en">The Question of Maitreya</title> is delivered in a relatively obscure
                        location, Mount Śuśumāra in the country of the Bhargas, while <title xml:lang="en">The Question of
                            Maitreya on the Eight Qualities</title> is set on Vulture Peak Mountain near Rājagṛha, like many other
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnakūṭa</title> sūtras. The two texts also have different colophons. The
                        translation of the longer sūtra is attributed to Jinamitra and Surendrabodhi, under the editorial
                        supervision of Yeshé Dé, which would date its Tibetan translation to the early ninth century. <title xml:lang="en">The Question of Maitreya on the Eight Qualities</title>, however, is said to have been
                        translated by Jinamitra and Danaśila, while Yeshé Dé is said to have corrected it using the revised
                        terminology (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">skad gsar</foreign>). This may imply a slightly later
                        date for this translation, but could also indicate the existence of an earlier Tibetan translation of
                            <title xml:lang="en">The Question of Maitreya on the Eight Qualities</title> which required updating

                        adhering to them, through the easy vehicle, the easy entry, and the easy path, perfectly accomplished
                        supreme, perfect, and complete enlightenment. Ānanda, when the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya was
                        formerly engaged in the conduct of a bodhisattva, he thought to himself, ‘How I wish that sentient beings,
                        having less desire, anger, and ignorance, might acquire the path of the ten virtuous actions! In the
                        future, may I perfectly accomplish supreme, perfect, and complete enlightenment and become a buddha.’ It
                        was thus that he consecrated his buddha realm. </p>

                        the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, due to the power of his prayer, will perfectly accomplish supreme,

                        Desire, anger, and ignorance will all increase. Beings will desire and crave irreligious things. They will
                        be overcome by fearsome desire, and adopt false doctrines. They will despise their fathers, their mothers,
                        their cousins, and their siblings, their partners, their relatives, noble beings, abbots, spiritual
