                                        Śākyamuni first exposes the error that prevents sentient
                                        beings from transcending saṃsāra. The Buddha then goes on to
                                        offer insights into the skillful manner in which someone
                                        wishing to attain liberation should view the following five
                                        sets of qualities: (1) the four truths of the noble ones,
                                        (2) the four applications of mindfulness, (3) the eightfold

                                                The conversation between the Buddha and Mañjuśrī in
                                                this sūtra begins with a discussion of how one comes
                                                to be trapped in saṃsāra and how, with the aim of
                                                extricating oneself from this undesirable state, one
                                                should relate to various phenomena. Within this
                                                framework, the topic of the dialogue moves from the
                                                four truths to certain categories of the aids to
                                                enlightenment. In conclusion, the Buddha himself
                                                conveniently provides the following summary of the
                                                content of his teaching:</p>

                                                these foundational Buddhist teachings. In connection
                                                with the four truths of the noble ones, for
                                                instance, it cites the common formula, “suffering is
                                                to be understood, its origin is to be abandoned, its
                                                cessation is to be realized, the path is to be
                                                cultivated.” Similarly, in the context of the four
                                                applications of mindfulness, the Buddha tells
                                                Mañjuśrī that he will teach the meditation on the
                                                body as “ugly,” feeling and mind as “arising and
                                                ceasing,” and phenomena as devoid of “notions of
                                                them as wholes.” However, the sūtra uses these early
                                                Buddhist teachings only as a starting point on which

                                                goes into a large variety of mental constructions

                                                does so. The sūtra’s exposition is for the most part

                                                enlightenment is highly varied in terms of how each

                                                佛說大乘善見變化文殊師利問法經 (Taishō 472). The Tibetan and
                                                Chinese translations diverge quite considerably in
                                                the details, which can be observed, for instance, in
                                                the presentations of the individual members of the
                                                aids to enlightenment. The two translations
                                                generally follow the same structure, although here
                                                too there are a few differences. While the Chinese
                                                follows the common order of the seven categories of
                                                the aids to enlightenment, the Tibetan presents the
                                                eightfold path immediately after the applications of
                                                mindfulness. Moreover, in the Chinese translation
                                                the Buddha also teaches four kinds of effort and
                                                five kinds of power, two of the three categories
                                                that are missing in the Tibetan. Even the category
                                                “bases of supernatural power” is mentioned, although
                                                its members are not discussed.</p>

                                                therefore do not transcend saṃsāra.”</p>
                                        <p tid="29">The Bhagavān replied, “Mañjuśrī, it is because

                                                Why is that so? Mañjuśrī, it is because seeing self
                                                and others will bring about karma. Mañjuśrī,

                                                thus, they bring about the three types of karma:
                                                corporeal, verbal, and mental. Reifying what does
                                                not exist, they think, ‘I am attached,’ ‘I am
