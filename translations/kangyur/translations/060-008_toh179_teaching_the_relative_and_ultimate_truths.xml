                        <title xml:lang="en">Teaching the Relative and Ultimate Truths</title> is a sūtra significant in the canon
                        of the Great Vehicle, concerned as it is with one of the key themes of Buddhist philosophy, the two
                        truths. These two principles are (1) the relative truth (understanding the world as it appears); and (2)
                        the ultimate truth (understanding the world as it is). Since this bifurcation of reality is one of the
                        frameworks underlying the entirety of Buddhist thought, the message of this sūtra is of importance for all
                        Buddhist traditions, and for the Great Vehicle in particular.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-060-008-4"/>
                    <p tid="5">Some readers may be surprised that most of the teaching delivered in this sūtra is spoken not by
                        the Buddha himself, but by his disciple Mañjuśrī. However, as readers familiar with the Great Vehicle
                        sūtras will have noticed, in this literature the Buddha often encourages his students to teach, and
                        subsequently endorses their lectures as <foreign xml:lang="la">bona fide</foreign> “words of the Buddha”
                            (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">buddhavacana</foreign>). In this way Mañjuśrī’s teaching
                        becomes authentic scripture through the awakened activity of the Buddha himself. Still, before Mañjuśrī
                        can deliver his eloquent teaching, he must first arrive in this world, as it turns out that he has
                        temporarily taken up residence in a distant buddha realm, known as Jewel World. </p>

                    <p tid="6">The sūtra, which takes place on Vulture Peak Mountain—a hill just outside the ancient city of
                        Rājagṛha, capital of what was then the state of Magadha—begins with a bodhisattva god named Lord of Peace
                        and Calm asking the Buddha where Mañjuśrī might be found. The Buddha announces that Mañjuśrī has moved to
                        a buddha realm many thousands of world systems away. There, the Buddha explains, Mañjuśrī lives in the
                        assembly of another buddha, Ratnaketu. Lord of Peace and Calm politely requests the Buddha to send a
                        signal to Mañjuśrī summoning him to this world, since Mañjuśrī is the only bodhisattva who is able to
                        teach in a way that demolishes all dualistic experience or, as the text describes it, experience that
                        involves “reference points.” </p>

                    <p tid="7">The Buddha obliges and immediately sends forth a light from the magical hair between his eyebrows.
                        The light inspires Mañjuśrī to return to this world, this time joined on his travels by an enormous
                        assembly of bodhisattvas from the buddha realm of Ratnaketu. They arrive and, accompanied by much pomp and
                        festivity, they offer proper worship to Buddha Śākyamuni. Once they have settled here in this world,
                        Mañjuśrī is asked to give the assembly a teaching just like the instructions offered by Buddha Ratnaketu
                        in his far-off buddha realm.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-060-008-7"/>
                    <p tid="8">As Mañjuśrī begins to teach, the main message of the sūtra unfolds in the form of an explanation of
                        the two truths. The general theme of Mañjuśrī’s discourse is centered on the particular circumstances in
                        Ratnaketu’s buddha realm, but the message is equally applicable to the experiences of beings here in this
                        world.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-060-008-8"/>
                    <p tid="9">There are two truths, Mañjuśrī teaches. There is the relative truth in which all types of
                        experiences unfold—good and bad, virtuous and nonvirtuous, pleasant and painful, awakened and confused.
                        This truth also includes all the spiritual trainings that take an ordinary being along the path to the
                        state of awakening itself. And then there is the ultimate truth, in which it is realized that all the
                        phenomena experienced on the relative level are, in their most fundamental state, in Mañjuśrī’s words,
                        “unborn, unarisen, and unreal.” This is the truth that is experienced by awakened beings. Still, even
                        though awakened beings perceive the unborn, unarisen, and unreal nature of all phenomena, they actively
                        participate in the relative aspect of things. In relative terms, awakened beings carry out the trainings
                        on the path, guide confused beings toward the liberated state, and perform a multitude of services to
                        beings in general. Nevertheless, as Mañjuśrī teaches again and again in this sūtra, they train without
                        training, they guide without guiding, and they serve without serving. Through such paradoxical
                        expressions, Mañjuśrī describes the experiences of those who have direct understanding of both the
                        ultimate and relative truths. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-060-008-9"/>
                    <p tid="10">The teaching unfolds organically as Mañjuśrī responds to a series of questions put by several of
                        the bodhisattvas in Buddha Śākyamuni’s retinue. Although the recurring theme of the teaching remains the
                        nature of the two truths, Mañjuśrī covers a variety of topics specific to the questions asked. In this way
                        he describes the qualities of both the hearers and bodhisattvas in Buddha Ratnaketu’s circle and the moral
                        trainings (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vinaya</foreign>) that they observe.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-060-008-10"/>
                    <p tid="11">Interestingly, Mañjuśrī teaches that the very same acts that the hearers in the assembly avoid,
                        the bodhisattvas adopt as their core training, although with a twist. For example, while the hearers seek
                        to avoid miserliness at all cost, the bodhisattvas engage precisely in “miserliness,” albeit with the
                        understanding that it is the welfare of other beings that they refuse to relinquish, rather than any
                        worldly mammon. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-060-008-11"/>
                    <p tid="12">Toward the latter half of the sūtra, the teaching takes on a more personal character as the
                        bodhisattvas interview Mañjuśrī concerning his own personal attainments and practice. In this way we find
                        Mañjuśrī describing his own insights and spiritual prowess, although in somewhat cryptic language.
                        Accordingly, when Lord of Peace and Calm asks him whether he directly comprehends the unarisen nature of
                        phenomena on the ultimate level, Mañjuśrī replies, “Divine son, the utterly unarisen does not comprehend
                        the utterly unarisen. And why? Because, divine son, all phenomena are utterly unborn, utterly unarisen,
                        and utterly unreal.” </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-060-008-12"/>
                    <p tid="13">At the end of Mañjuśrī’s teaching, the Buddha praises and approves what he has taught. Here, the
                        Buddha is asked by several bodhisattvas to elaborate on some of the themes raised by Mañjuśrī. In general,
                        throughout the sūtra, it is clear that the teachings and trainings of the bodhisattvas are considered
                        preferable, superior, and far vaster in scope than those of the hearers. This is here confirmed by the
                        Buddha, using a series of analogies that illustrate the superiority of the bodhisattva vehicle. For
                        example, the conceptual wisdom of the hearers is compared to a single drop of water, while the
                        nonconceptual wisdom of the bodhisattvas is taught to be infinitely greater, like the great ocean. The
                        reader is left in no doubt as to where the protagonists in this sūtra stand in terms of their devotional
                        allegiance. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-060-008-13"/>
                    <p tid="14">Toward the end of the sūtra, in a final display of his superior spiritual abilities, Mañjuśrī
                        enters an absorption that allows him to alter the perceptions of everyone present, so that they now
                        perceive this world as the buddha realm of Ratnaketu. Encouraged by the Buddha, Mañjuśrī reveals his
                        magically created illusion to everyone, before departing for that distant buddha realm from whence he
                        first arrived. </p>

                    <p tid="15">At the very end of the sūtra, we find the customary inquiry by Ānanda to the Buddha regarding the
                        title of the sūtra, its benefits to potential devotees, and the right way to propagate it. </p>

                        living in the desire and form realms. There, the Blessed One taught the Dharma, surrounded and honored by
                        a retinue of many hundreds of thousands of beings. </p>

                        Blessed One and, bowing with joined palms in the direction of the Blessed One, asked the Blessed One,
                        “Blessed One, where is <ref cRef="F.245.a"/> Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta now? Blessed One, I myself and everyone

                        18,000 other buddha realms, there is a buddha realm called Jewel World. There, the Thus-gone, worthy,
                        perfect Buddha Ratnaketu at present lives and teaches the Dharma; and Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta is there

                        sign were made such that Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, upon seeing it, would wish to return here. The reason is,
                        Blessed One, that Dharma teachings such as those of Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta are not to be heard from any of
                        the hearers, solitary buddhas, or those bodhisattvas who rely on reference points. Except for the
                        Thus-gone One, no one else at all is capable of teaching the Dharma in that manner. Blessed One, when
                        Mañjuśrī teaches the Dharma, all the dwellings of the demons lose their luster. Moreover, all demons
                        become unable to inflict any harm. All opposition is utterly defeated. Those with reference points are
                        left without reference. The sacred Dharma also remains for a long time. The Thus-gone One will also
                        rejoice in this and approve of it.”</p>

                    <p tid="26">The Blessed Ratnaketu replied, “He did so in order to summon Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta. And why? To
                        make him return there. In that buddha’s retinue there are numerous bodhisattva great beings as well as
                        many gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, and so forth. They all want to behold Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta and <ref cRef="F.246.a"/> hear him teach the Dharma.” </p>

                    <p tid="31">The Blessed One replied, “Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, accompanied by ten thousand bodhisattvas, has come
                        from the Jewel World to this Sahā world. With their bodies invisible, <ref cRef="F.246.b"/> they all sent

                        speech, or mind, that is not ‘ultimate truth’ but relative truth itself. Rather, divine son, on the
                        ultimate level, ultimate truth transcends all conventions. It is without specific instances; it does not
