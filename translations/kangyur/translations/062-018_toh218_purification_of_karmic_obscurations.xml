                <p tid="1">The Buddha is residing at Āmrapālī’s Grove in Vaiśālī, when Mañjuśrī brings before him the monk
                    Stainless Light, who had been seduced by a prostitute and feels strong remorse for having violated his vows.
                    After the monk confesses his wrongdoing, the Buddha explains the lack of inherent nature of all phenomena and
                    the luminous nature of mind, and the monk Stainless Light gives rise to the mind of enlightenment. At
                    Mañjuśrī’s request, the Buddha then explains how bodhisattvas purify obscurations by generating an altruistic
                    mind and realizing the empty nature of all phenomena. He asks Mañjuśrī about his own attainment of patient
                    forbearance in seeing all phenomena as non-arising and recounts the tale of the monk Vīradatta, who, many eons
                    in the past, had engaged in a sexual affair with a girl and even killed a jealous rival before feeling strong
                    remorse. Despite these negative actions, once the empty, non-existent nature of all phenomena had been
                    explained to him by the bodhisattva Liberator from Fear, he was able to generate bodhicitta and attain patient
                    forbearance in seeing all phenomena as non-arising. The Buddha explains that even a person who had enjoyed
                    pleasures and murdered someone would be able to attain patient forbearance in seeing all phenomena as
                    non-arising through practicing this sūtra, which he calls “the Dharma mirror of all phenomena.” </p>

                    <p tid="4">The setting for this sūtra is Āmrapālī’s Grove in Vaiśālī, where Buddha Śākyamuni taught and
                        performed miracles. The Lord Buddha visited Vaiśālī several times; first, in the fifth year after his
                        enlightenment, he spent the rainy season there, and later, he laid down various rules of the Vinaya at
                        Vaiśālī, as well as giving other important discourses. On his last visit he announced his approaching
                        parinirvāṇa. In addition, one hundred years after the Buddha’s parinirvāṇa, it was the site of the second
                        Buddhist Council.</p>

                    <p tid="5">This sūtra relates the story of a monk who has been seduced by a prostitute and is deeply
                        remorseful for his actions. Mañjuśrī takes him to seek the counsel of the Buddha. What is interesting is
                        the way in which the Buddha deals with monastic discipline and the ethical impairment of the monk’s vows,
                        contrasting the view of emptiness, or the lack of intrinsic nature of phenomena, and morality. Here, the
                        view of emptiness trumps the code of monastic discipline as explained in the Vinaya. From the point of
                        view of the monk’s vows, sleeping with a woman is a disaster; however, this moral discourse takes the
                        point of view of emptiness. This is an example of how the codes of monastic discipline are sometimes
                        subordinated to the ultimate view of emptiness. Although the Vinaya is practiced in all vehicles,
                        including the Vajrayāna, it is given different priorities. For example, in the Mahāyāna, if a monk holds
                        the bodhisattva vows, certain exceptions can be made to his monastic vows, such as the one that prohibits
                        touching a woman, when he is employing skillful means. Here in this text, however (although it is a
                        Mahāyāna sūtra), the emphasis is not on any such skillful means, but on the metaphysical view of
                        emptiness.</p>

                        Kangyur; discrepancies and remarks are indicated in the endnotes. This text was translated solely on the
                        basis of the Tibetan versions, as a Sanskrit original has not been found. When the names of individuals
                        are generally known in Sanskrit, e.g. Mañjuśrī, they are presented here in Sanskrit. In the case of many
                        other personal names, however, it is difficult to establish from the Tibetan translation an unquestionable
                        rendering back into Sanskrit; these names are therefore translated into English instead.</p>

                    <p tid="7">The Sanskrit title of the work, as transcribed in the Degé and most other recensions of the
                        Kangyur, is—shorn of its honorific elements—<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Karmāvaraṇa­viśuddha­sūtra</foreign>, which could be translated as “purified of karmic obscurations.”
                        However, the sūtra is mentioned in Śāntideva’s <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Śikṣā­samuccaya</title> with the
                        title <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Karmāvaraṇa­viśuddhi­sūtra</foreign> (which is also the spelling given in
                        the Narthang Kangyur), and we have followed most modern cataloguers of the Kangyur in taking this spelling
                        as the probable original version, rendering it as <title xml:lang="en">Purification of Karmic
                            Obscurations</title>.</p>

                    <p tid="8"> According to the colophon, the sūtra was originally translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan by the
                        Indian paṇḍitas Jinamitra and Prajñāvarman, and by the principal editor-translator (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">lo tsā ba</foreign>), the monk Yeshé Dé (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ye shes
                            sde</foreign>), and others. Jinamitra was a Kaśmīri of around the late eighth to early ninth century
                        who travelled to Samyé Monastery in Tibet during the reign of the Dharma king Trisong Detsen (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">khri srong lde btsan</foreign>) to engage in translation; he and Yeshé Dé
                        collaborated on the translation of many hundreds of works. The translation of this text is listed in the
                        Denkarma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan dkar ma</foreign>) catalogue, compiled in 824, and was thus most
                        likely prepared in the early ninth century. </p>
