            <p tid="2"> In this scripture Śākyamuni Buddha describes how a bodhisattva should
               ideally train in the six perfections. Set in Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha, the Buddha teaches
               this sūtra in response to a single question posed to him by the bodhisattva Subāhu:
               how many qualities should a bodhisattva have in order to progress to perfect
               awakening? The Buddha responds by first listing the six perfections of generosity,
               ethical discipline, patience, diligence, concentration, and insight, and then
               expounding in greater detail on each perfection in turn.</p>

               <p tid="8">The Mahāratnakūṭa collection, as Jonathan Silk (1994) has argued based on
                  the work of Nagao and others, probably formed around the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāśyapa­pari­varta</title>, which was perhaps originally the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnakūṭasūtra</title>. Moreover, Silk (ibid.) demonstrates
                  in his study of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnarāśisūtra</title>, another text
                  in the Mahāratnakūṭa collection with affinities to the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāśyapa­pari­varta</title>, that their shared features point toward the
                  characteristics of a specific kind of “textual community.” This textual community
                  was perhaps one of many that were influential in the rise of the Great Vehicle.
                  Three of the defining features of this proposed textual community that can be
                  gleaned from the work of Silk and others (Nattier 2003, Boucher 2008) are an
                  absence of discernible antagonism between śrāvaka (hearer) and bodhisattva
                  practitioners; an emphasis on monastic ideals; and a concomitant valorization of
                  renunciation and the ascetic life. </p>

               <p tid="9">
                  <title xml:lang="en">The Inquiry of Subāhu</title> corresponds only in small part
                  to this pattern. The ideal bodhisattva, as the Buddha describes in response to the
                  titular inquiry of Subāhu, should strive to preserve the integrity of and even
                  acquire his own “great saṅgha of hearer attendants”; and throughout, he presents
                  the “Hearers' Vehicle” as a perfectly viable approach, even instructing that
                  a bodhisattva should teach the vehicles of the hearers, solitary buddhas, and
                  bodhisattvas, as appropriate. Nonetheless, there is also a discernible hierarchy
                  in the Buddha’s presentation that reflects the presumed superiority of the
                  Bodhisattvas' Vehicle. Moreover, Subāhu, as the sūtra’s opening frame seems to
                  suggest, is probably a lay bodhisattva, and the stipulations for the bodhisattva’s
                  ideal performance of generosity and ethical discipline thus reflect a resolutely
                  lay orientation. For instance, a bodhisattva should give gifts as extravagant as
                  land; he should never give in a way that harms his children, wives, male and
                  female slaves, or servants and laborers; and his ethical discipline should consist
                  primarily of observing the five lay vows of an upāsaka. Moreover, the Buddha
                  presents along with the ideal performance of each perfection a path of gradual
                  training for those who presently lack the capacity to implement the ideal. The
                  Buddha then concludes each of these passages by stating that the aspiration to
                  implement the ideal is itself the highest form of each perfection. All of these
                  features taken together suggests an open appeal to an audience that extends beyond
                  the circle of strict ascetics.</p>

               <p tid="10">
                  <title xml:lang="en">The Inquiry of Subāhu</title> also diverges from another type
                  of “textual community” that was prominent in the rise of the Great Vehicle. This
                  type, which Gregory Schopen (2005) has characterized as the “cult of the book,”
                  foregrounds the act of preaching, the preacher, and the physical object of the
                  scriptural book itself as the center of Buddhist cultic life. The cult of the book
                  has found expression in formulas that appear repeatedly throughout many Great
                  Vehicle sūtras, which promise to fulfill pragmatic and soteriological aims,
                  including bringing the Buddha into presence, simply through the copying, reciting,
                  preaching, carrying, or wearing of texts. <title xml:lang="en">The Inquiry of
                     Subāhu</title> lacks any such formulations, but it does stipulate that
                  bodhisattvas should build and worship stūpas, which was another and perhaps older
                  way of bringing the Buddha into presence after his passing (Trainor 1997). All
                  told, then, the ideal audience for <title xml:lang="en">The Inquiry of
                     Subāhu</title> appears to have been primarily, but not exclusively, lay
                  Buddhist practitioners connected to monastic communities that consisted of both
                  hearer and bodhisattva practitioners, and had stūpas in their care. </p>
               <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-043-007-8"/>
               <p tid="11">To briefly summarize this work’s contents, the sūtra is set in Veṇuvana,
                  at the Kalandaka­nivāpa, near Rājagṛha, where the Buddha is staying in the company
                  of a large assembly of monks. A bodhisattva great being by the name of Subāhu,
                  with servants in tow, visits the Buddha from the nearby town of Rājagṛha to pose a
                  single question: how many qualities should bodhisattvas have in order to progress
                  to perfect awakening? The entire sūtra consists of the Buddha’s response to this
                  question. He begins by simply listing the six perfections of generosity, ethical
                  discipline, patience, diligence, concentration, and insight, and then he expounds
                  in greater detail on each perfection in turn. Each of the six sections of the
                  ensuing discourse stipulates first how bodhisattvas should ideally practice the
                  relevant perfection, and then how bodhisattvas should gradually train in that
                  perfection if they lack the requisite capacity to undertake it as ideally
                  stipulated. Each section ends by emphasizing how simply the aspiration to ideally
                  undertake the relevant perfection is in fact the most sublime form of the
                  perfection; it is the cultivation of this mental attitude, stresses the Buddha,
                  suffused with compassion for all beings, that will enable bodhisattvas to swiftly
                  and easily complete the perfections.</p>

               <p tid="13"> The present translation is based mainly on the Tibetan version of the
                  sūtra present in the Degé Kangyur, in consultation with the variant readings
                  presented in the Comparative Edition (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe bsdur
                     ma</foreign>) and the Stok Palace version. According to its colophon, <title xml:lang="en">The Inquiry of Subāhu</title> was translated into Tibetan,
                  edited, and finalized, based on revisions done according to the language reform,
                  by a translation team consisting of the Indian preceptors Dānaśīla and Jinamitra,
                  and the Tibetan chief editor-translator venerable Yeshé Dé, who were active in
                  Tibet in the late eighth and early ninth centuries. Indeed, the sūtra is listed in

                  compassion, joy, and impartiality. The Noble Ones' Vehicle is the eightfold

                  right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right absorption. </p>
