                    family and prophesied the awakening of the prince Ratnākara. Buddha Śākyamuni

                        a scripture that belongs to the general sūtra section of the Degé Kangyur.
                        The sūtra is set in Anāthapiṇḍada’s park at Śrāvastī, where Buddha Śākyamuni
                        resides with a gathering of monks and bodhisattvas. In delivering his
                        teaching, Śākyamuni describes an ancient world known as Flower Origin<note place="end" index="1" xml:id="UT22084-066-005-4"> The Sanskrit name for
                            this world is most likely <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">puṣpākara</foreign>. This is attested in the Negi dictionary for

                                gnas</foreign> and it is found in BHSD as the name of a buddha
                            (Edgerton, 1998, p. 350). We have not, however, found a world by this
                            name, i.e., a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">puṣpākaraloka</foreign> and so have rendered this name in English
                            translation.</note> in which the buddha Arisen from Flowers<note place="end" index="2" xml:id="UT22084-066-005-5"> Although canonical
                            sources list past buddhas known either as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">puṣpa</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">puṣpita</foreign>,
                            and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">puṣpakṛta</foreign>, we have not found
                            an attested Sanskrit for the Tibetan <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">me tog

                            especially because clear lists and equivalents for buddha-names such as
                            these do not as yet seem to be available. For a discussion of the names

                        ruler known as Attainment of Victory, under whose rule everyone practiced
                        the Great Vehicle. Prompted by the prince Ratnākara, the royal family goes
                        to meet Arisen from Flowers. This buddha then teaches the audience about the
                        insubstantial and unsatisfactory nature of the aggregates, and describes
                        beings’ tendency to perceive the aggregates in a flawed manner: while the
                        aggregates are actually impermanent, repulsive, unclean, and unreal,
                        sentient beings conceive of them as lasting, pleasant, pure, and true.
                        Śākyamuni further explains how beings are themselves a product of their
                        actions, and that the five aggregates (the components that together
                        constitute a sentient being) are not purposely created by anyone.</p>

                    <p tid="7">The sūtra thus presents a version of the well–known four errors

                            <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phyin ci log pa bzhi</foreign>)
                        that are often described in Buddhist canonical literature as the main
                        underpinnings of sentient beings’ mistaken view of the world: (1)
                        erroneously perceiving that the impermanent is permanent, (2) the painful is
                        pleasant, (3) the dirty is clean, and (4) that what has no self has a self.<note place="end" index="3" xml:id="UT22084-066-005-7"> For a discussion
                            of these four errors, see Lang (2003).</note> The four errors are also
                        discussed <foreign xml:lang="la" type="term">in
                            extenso</foreign> in canonical literature—in the Abhidharma, but also in
                        chapters 6–9 of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Catuḥśataka</title> of Āryadeva
                        (fl. third cent.), where each is treated in a separate chapter.<note place="end" index="4" xml:id="UT22084-066-005-8"> Lang (1986).</note>
                        The present sūtra invokes the four errors, but instead of presenting the
                        illusion that the painful is pleasant, it speaks of the illusion that the
                        repulsive (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mi sdug pa</foreign>) is
                        beautiful (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">sdug pa</foreign>). Aside
                        from this minor twist, the context remains that of the four errors
                        traditionally mentioned in Buddhist literature. </p>

                        king, queen, prince, and the entire retinue all take ordination. The
                        Thus-Gone One then prophesies prince Ratnākara’s awakening, revealing his
                        future name, world, lifespan, and the nature of his teachings. Toward the
                        end of the sūtra, Śākyamuni reveals the current identity of the main
                        characters of his narrative. Arisen from Flowers has now become the buddha
                        Amitābha and Ratnākara has become the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. In the
                        remainder of the sūtra, Śākyamuni reveals that anyone who faithfully
                        receives this Dharma teaching will be reborn in Sukhāvatī (the buddha realm
                        of Amitābha) and that all women who touch or read this sūtra will be able to
                        exchange their female bodies for male forms and never again take rebirth in
                        a female body. </p>

                        turn into men in order to awaken to buddhahood is a common idea found
                        throughout Mahāyāna literature.<note place="end" index="5" xml:id="UT22084-066-005-11"> For more on this theme in Mahāyāna

                            of Indiana, 2002). </note> To a contemporary audience such a denigration
                        of the female body is of course problematic. However, it should be kept in
                        mind that these teachings were given in a society where the status of women
                        was generally low, and women were expected to be subservient to men. It is
                        also important to remember that the Buddha did, although reluctantly,
                        endorse female practitioners by allowing nuns into his order.</p>

                    <p tid="10">There is no extant Sanskrit version of this scripture, and the sūtra
                        does not appear to have been translated into Chinese either. In producing
                        this translation, we have based our work on the Degé xylograph while
                        consulting the Comparative Edition (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe bsdur

                        Dānaśīla, as well as the prolific Tibetan translator Yeshé Dé. We can
                        therefore date the Tibetan translation to the late eight to early ninth
                        century, a dating that is also attested by the text’s inclusion in the early

                        time, there is no need. Why so? Noble son, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect
                        buddha Amitābha was known at that time as the thus-gone Arisen from Flowers
                        and he taught the Dharma in that world. Noble son, should you wonder,

                        Avalokiteśvara was at that time the son of King Attainment of Victory. That
                        Thus-Gone One prophesied, ‘He will gain awakening from me.’”</p>
