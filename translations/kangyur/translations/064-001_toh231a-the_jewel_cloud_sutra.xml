                    gathering of the buddha Padma­netra’s bodhisattva disciples, headed by
                    Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin. Having miraculously traveled across numerous world
                    systems, the bodhisattvas present clouds of precious offerings to Śākyamuni and
                    blessings for sentient beings. The bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin requests
                    permission to ask a series of questions on the character and ways of the
                    bodhisattva. The main part of the sūtra contains Śākyamuni’s detailed replies.
                    In the concluding part, the sūtra is identified as the mother of all Dharma
                    teachings and the discipline of the bodhisattvas.</p>

                        the early ninth century translators Rinchen Tso and Chönyi Tsultrim. In the
                        introduction to the <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sgra sbyor bam po gnyis
                            pa</title> both of these figures are recorded as being influential
                        contributors to the third terminological revision that took place in the
                        year 814 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>.<note place="end" index="6" xml:id="UT22084-064-001-11"> Scherrer-Schaub 2002: 302–303, 317. </note>
                        Here they are listed by their Sanskrit names, Ratnarakṣita and Dharmatāśīla,
                        along with the honorific title of “Tibetan preceptors” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">bod kyi mkhan po</foreign>). In spite of
                        their apparently elevated status, there is, however, little that we know of
                        these two figures today. Apart from <title xml:lang="en">The Jewel
                            Cloud</title>, Rinchen Tso is only credited for having translated Toh
                        180, and Chönyi Tsultrim for translating Toh 176. Interestingly, in the
                        colophons of this text belonging to the Kangyurs in the Thempangma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">them spangs ma</foreign>) recension, the
                        Sanskrit name Vairocanarakṣita appears in the place of Rinchen Tso. The
                        Thempangma witnesses also state that these two figures only “edited,
                        finalized, and revised” the translation, whereas the colophons of the
                        Tshalpa (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">tshal pa</foreign>) group
                        (such as the Degé) mention that they “translated, edited, and finalized” the
                        sūtra. As such, some ambiguity remains as to whether these two translators
                        were merely editing a preexisting translation according to the new lexicon
                        that was being implemented at the time, or whether they produced an entirely
                        new translation. Given that this was a time when many older translations
                        were revised—and the prominent role these two figures are said to have
                        played in the revision process—we concur with Cristina Scherrer-Schaub that
                        the former option seems the most likely scenario.<note place="end" index="7" xml:id="UT22084-064-001-12">

                    <p tid="6">In producing this translation, we have based our work on the Degé xylograph
                        while consulting the comparative Pedurma edition, as well as the Stok Palace
                        manuscript. Interestingly, our comparison of the various sources has shown
                        that the Degé and Stok Palace Kangyurs often align, even when other Tshalpa
                        Kangyurs offer different (and sometimes better) readings.<note place="end" index="8" xml:id="UT22084-064-001-14">
                            Perhaps future research may be able to determine whether, and if so, to
                            what extent the editors of D favored the Thempangma line for their
                            edition of this text. Note, however, that D differs from S in the
                            opening line and the colophon, where a reading common to the Tshalpa
                            group is adopted. </note> We also occasionally compared these sources to
                        the available Dunhuang fragments of <title xml:lang="en">The Jewel

                        incorporate these sources to a greater degree than has been done here. Such
                        research is certain to further inform our understanding of the historical

                    <p tid="7">As for the contents of the sūtra, it begins with Buddha Śākyamuni residing
                        upon Gayā­śīrṣa Mountain in the region of Gayā. He is surrounded by a great
                        gathering of accomplished hearers and bodhisattvas, along with innumerable
                        human and nonhuman beings, including the most powerful gods, nāgas, and so
                        on. Splendidly seated upon a colossal, ornamented throne, the Buddha
                        radiates a miraculous light from his <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uṣṇīṣa</foreign> that illuminates the universes in the ten directions.
                        The light then returns and is absorbed into the Blessed One’s mouth. </p>

                    <p tid="8">In an extremely distant universe, the bodhisattva followers of the buddha
                        Padma­netra notice this light. When the great bodhisattva
                        Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin inquires about this with his teacher, Buddha
                        Padma­netra explains to him the origins of the light. Listening to
                        Padma­netra’s account, Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin is touched by Buddha
                        Śākyamuni’s compassionate acceptance of the barbaric and ungrateful beings
                        who inhabit the latter’s realm. Consequently, Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin asks
                        for permission to travel to see Buddha Śākyamuni and offer him his worship.
                        Having obtained Padma­netra’s blessing for the visit, Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin
                        leads a great gathering of bodhisattvas who journey to Śākyamuni’s realm and
                        Gayā­śīrṣa Mountain at Gayā. In worship of Śākyamuni, the bodhisattvas
                        emanate an infinite cloud of miraculous offerings. Likewise, to alleviate
                        the suffering of the beings born in the universe within which Śākyamuni
                        resides, the bodhisattvas send forth a vast array of emanated beings and
                        objects. Through these emanations, they heal sentient beings and transform
                        their environment. </p>

                    <p tid="9">When granted the opportunity, Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin proceeds to ask Buddha
                        Śākyamuni a long series of questions, all of which are concerned with the
                        nature, qualities, and activities of bodhisattvas. The main part of the
                        sūtra consists of Śākyamuni’s detailed replies to these questions,
                        interspersed with supportive dialogues between Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin and
                        the Buddha. In the course of his explanations, many beings are profoundly
                        affected by Śākyamuni’s teaching, and we hear of their attainment of varying
                        degrees of liberation and accomplishment. </p>

                        A­martyā, whose home is Gayā­śīrṣa Mountain, also comes forth to
                        circumambulate the Buddha in homage. Śākyamuni takes the occasion to explain
                        to certain disbelieving members of the gathering how the goddess, despite
                        her seemingly ordinary female form, in fact possesses perfect buddha

                        sūtra’s powers and blessing, describing it as the mother of all Dharma
                        teachings and the Vinaya of the bodhisattvas. The Buddha also offers
                        guidelines for the teaching and study of the sūtra, and the god Śakra
                        promises to serve and protect those who commit themselves to its teaching.
                        At Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin’s request, Śākyamuni provides the sūtra with four
                        distinct names. As the great gathering rejoices, the sūtra concludes.</p>

                        emerge certain statements that have become particularly absorbed into

                        serves as the remedy for desire that is caused by the appearance of a

                        repulsiveness? The contemplation of repulsiveness involves considering a

                        ways: First, shamelessness is when, while one remains alone and in private,
                        one’s mind remains desirous, giving rise to thoughts of desire. Thus one
                        holds desirous situations to be excellent and the emotion to be a good
                        quality. Absence of shyness, on the other hand, is when the causes,
                        conditions, and bases for desire make it so that even if one’s parents,
                        spiritual teacher, or the like object to, oppose, or criticize this, <ref cRef="F.23.a"/> one feels no shame about one’s desire, and instead,
                        shamelessly, one holds the emotion to be a valuable quality. Thus, by such
                        causes, conditions, and bases one will come to take birth in the lower
                        realms. This is what is known as <distinct>greater desire</distinct>. </p>

                        know no remaining. They are in motion, resembling dewdrops and a waterfall
                        in the mountains. What knowledgeable person would develop attachment to
                        them, or desire them, or be pained by their disappearance?’ Thus, due to
                        such causes, conditions, and bases, they develop weariness, free themselves
                        from desire, and turn their minds toward cessation. Such is the
                        bodhisattvas’ expertise concerning the conditioned. </p>

                        Attracted to cyclic existence, they are bound by the chains of existence and

                        existence to another. Due to this, they take birth. Once born, they also
                        have to age and die, and with death follows endless pain, lamentation,
                        suffering, and distress, as well as ceaseless turmoil. Thus emerges this

                        attachment to formation, and without such attachment there will be no

                        When there is no craving, there cannot be grasping, and when there is no
                        grasping there is no connection to a future existence. Without such future
                        existence there will not be any birth, and in the absence of birth there

                        and the nirgranthas. Attempting to mature them, bodhisattvas think, ‘Alas,
                        these beings have been taken by pride. In the past I was unable to train
                        them as their master, so now I shall accept to be their disciple.’ So they

                        and their words are kept in mind and adhered to. When the bodhisattvas then
                        feel that the non-Buddhists have become close students, they declare,

                        tame such beings is to emanate a fine and lovely girl—the most beautiful

                        before that person and ask, ‘Hey, you, why are you unhappy and depressed?’
                        The reply may be, ‘Noble son, I have committed a deed with immediate
                        consequences, and so I fear that I shall suffer harm for a long time and
                        that for me there will be no fortune, but only suffering.’ Saying this, that
                        person will be unhappy and depressed. Yet the bodhisattva will let that
                        being receive vows and confess their misdeeds. Thereupon the bodhisattva
                        will teach the most profound Dharma. However, if that person does not
                        relinquish their remorse, the bodhisattva will first gain that person’s
                        trust by performing a miraculous feat or by reading their mind. Once the
                        person has developed genuine trust, he or she will be delighted with the
                        bodhisattva, feel inspired, and have appreciation. And once that person is
                        delighted, inspired, and appreciative, he or she will have become fit for
                        the teaching of Dharma, as they will now regard the bodhisattva as an
                        agreeable person. Before that individual the bodhisattva will then project
                        emanations of the bodhisattva’s parents and say, ‘Hey, you, look here and
                        drop your regrets. <ref cRef="F.30.a"/> I am your friend and I am telling
                        you that no one ever went to hell or became deprived of all success by doing

                        cleared away through wisdom.’ Having said this, the bodhisattva will then
                        sever the life-force of their parents and, as the parents are slain, the
                        bodhisattva will display miracles. At that point the transgressor will
                        think, ‘Since even someone endowed with miraculous powers may slay their
                        parents, then how about someone like me?’ The bodhisattva will then by any
                        means teach that person a Dharma instruction that renders their karma as
                        light as the wings of a bee. Such is the bodhisattvas’ skill in dispelling

                        placed in the palm of their hand, they react with great dejection, thinking,
                        ‘For the sake of just a single being I am ready to bear the suffering of the
                        Hell of Incessant Pain until that being enters the field of the

                        who nevertheless diligently and persistently pursue the attainments of the

                        such beings from those abodes and into the Great Vehicle, even if it takes
                        creating a schism among the followers of the teaching. Such is the

                        Bodhisattvas cause those beings who have not yet given rise to the awakened
                        mind to do so. Others may have already given rise to the awakened mind, yet
                        they are lazy, have little diligence, and are content with discipline alone.
                        Bodhisattvas will cause such beings to develop diligence. Still others may

                        constant equipoise. The oceans can be compared to the oceans of absorption.

                        grasping at self. Being free from such fears, they will also not have any
                        fears, anxieties, or qualms about staying in the wilderness, and so they
                        will turn toward complete solitude. Then, living in the wild and having
                        turned toward complete solitude, they will become uninvolved in ordinary
                        social activities, like deer. However, noble son, unlike deer, bodhisattvas
                        who live in the wild are not constantly afraid and they do not have any of
                        the shortcomings of deer. Deer worry that their pursuers will bring an end
                        to their life, and so they take off, leaving the land behind and crossing
                        the greatest of distances. Bodhisattvas, similarly, worry that their
                        pursuers will bring an end to their commitment and cause them to become
                        distracted. Thus, they avoid socializing with women, men, boys, and girls.
                        Refraining from involvement in worldly distractions, they leave all social
                        ties far behind. In this way they keep their distance, having turned toward
                        complete solitude. Being in this way inclined to utter solitude, they
                        perceive the wilderness to be a place of excellent qualities and a place of
                        peace. Perceiving their hermitage to be excellent and peaceful, they will
                        stay clear of displeasure, and as they stay clear of displeasure they will
                        truly experience the qualities of the wilderness. </p>

                        son, is this so? Because the bodhisattvas’ awakening to unexcelled and
                        complete buddhahood depends on accomplishing the aims of sentient beings. If
                        there were no sentient beings, the bodhisattvas could not achieve complete
                        buddhahood. Thus, noble son, they worship and venerate the thus-gone ones by
                        means of worshiping the Dharma. Their worship is not in terms of material
                        things. Noble son, bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities have skill in
                        worshiping and venerating the thus-gone ones. </p>

                        there will be appropriation. Engagement in appropriation leads to a new
                        existence, and if there is a new existence, there is birth. With birth comes

                        ordinary trees. Since the whole environment became pure, there now appeared
                        nothing but wish-fulfilling trees. <ref cRef="F.111.a"/> In that pure
                        environment there were springs, ponds, pools, and reservoirs brimming with
                        water of the eight qualities. No ordinary humans were seen and not even the
                        word <emph>woman</emph> could be heard anywhere. In that pure environment
                        lotus flowers the size of chariot wheels grew and within each of them
                        appeared bodhisattvas, seated in cross-legged posture. The Blessed One, the
                        thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha A­martyā was teaching the Dharma to all
                        these bodhisattvas. This buddha appeared surrounded by Śakra, Brahmā, and
                        many quadrillions of the guardians of the world. Beseeched by many
                        quadrillions of bodhisattvas, this buddha taught the Dharma exclusively from
                        the perspective of the intrinsic nature. Then the goddess A­martyā emerged
                        from her absorption, circumambulated the Blessed One three times to the
                        right, and disappeared. </p>

                        to, memorizing, upholding, reading, mastering, reciting, and delivering this

                        Generosity with material things is insignificant, whereas generosity with
                        the Dharma possesses great miraculous power. And why is that? Because, noble
                        son, while sentient beings revolving within cyclic existence <ref cRef="F.111.b"/> have abundant experience with material things, they
                        have never experienced the taste of the Dharma that is beyond the world. The

                        teaching should be regarded as a great shrine, and you should think, ‘Herein
                        resides our Teacher.’ And why, noble sons? Because its intrinsic nature is
                        awakening. Its intrinsic nature is the turning of the wheel of Dharma. Noble
                        sons, the thus-gone ones are the Dharma body; so, noble sons, by worshiping
