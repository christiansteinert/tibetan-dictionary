                    Meaningful</title>. One is in the narrative structure: Buddha Śākyamuni tells how, countless
                    eons ago, in a world called Flower Origin, a buddha named Arisen from Flowers 
                    gave instructions to a royal family, and prophesied the awakening of the prince 
                    Ratnākara. Arisen from Flowers, Buddha Śākyamuni then relates, has since become the buddha
                    Amitābha, and the prince Ratnākara the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. The other theme 
                    is doctrinal, and lies in the content of the teaching given by Arisen from Flowers: it 
                    explains the four mistakes made by ordinary beings in the way they perceive the 
                    five aggregates, and how bodhisattvas teach them how to clear away these misconceptions, 
                    so that they may be free of the sufferings that result. </p>

                        a scripture that in the Degé Kangyur belongs to the General Sūtra section.
                        The sūtra is set in Anāthapiṇḍada’s park at Śrāvastī, where Buddha Śākyamuni
                        is residing with a gathering of monks and bodhisattvas. In delivering his
                        teaching, Śākyamuni describes an ancient world known as Flower 
                        Origin,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-005-4" index="1"> The Sanskrit name for
                            this world is most likely <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">puṣpākara</foreign>. This is attested in Negi for
                                <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">me tog gi ’byung gnas</foreign> and it is found 
                            in Edgerton (1998, p. 350) as the name of a buddha. We have not, however, found a world by this
                            name, i.e., a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">puṣpākaraloka</foreign>, and have 
                            therefore rendered this name in English
                            translation.</note> in which lived a buddha called Arisen from 
                        Flowers.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-005-5" index="2"> Although canonical
                            sources list past buddhas known either as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">puṣpa</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">puṣpita</foreign>,
                            or <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">puṣpakṛta</foreign>, we have not found
                            an attested Sanskrit for the Tibetan <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">me tog

                            English translation of this name, rather than attempt a reconstruction,
                            especially because clear lists and equivalents for such names of buddhas as
                            these do not as yet seem to be available. For a discussion of the names
                            of buddhas listed in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhadra­kalpika­sūtra</title>, see Skilling (2010) and, in
                            particular, Skilling (2014). </note> That world was governed by a
                        king known as Attainment of Victory, under whose rule everyone practiced
                        the Great Vehicle. Prompted by the prince Ratnākara, the royal family goes
                        to meet Arisen from Flowers. That buddha then teaches the audience about the
                        insubstantial and unsatisfactory nature of the aggregates, and describes
                        beings’ tendency to perceive the aggregates in a flawed manner: while the
                        aggregates are actually impermanent, repulsive, unclean, and unreal,
                        sentient beings conceive of them as lasting, beautiful, pure, and true.
                        Buddha Śākyamuni further explains how beings are themselves a product of their
                        actions, and that the five aggregates (the components that together
                        constitute a sentient being) are not purposely created by anyone.</p>

                    <p tid="7">The sūtra thus presents a version of the well–known “four errors”
                            (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">catvāro viparyāsāḥ</foreign>,
                            <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phyin ci log pa bzhi</foreign>),
                        often described in Buddhist canonical literature as the main
                        underpinnings of sentient beings’ mistaken view of the world: 
                        erroneously perceiving (1) the impermanent to be permanent, (2) the painful to be
                        pleasant, (3) the dirty to be clean, and (4) what has no self to have 
                        a self.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-005-7" index="3"> For a discussion
                            of these four errors, see Lang (2003).</note> The four errors are 
                        discussed extensively not only in the Abhidharma, but also in
                        the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Catuḥśataka</title> of Āryadeva
                        (fl. third century), where each is treated in a separate chapter 
                        (chapters 6–9).<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-005-8" index="4">See Lang (1986).</note>
                        The present sūtra invokes the four errors, but instead of presenting the
                        illusion that the painful is pleasant, it speaks of the illusion that the
                        repulsive (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mi sdug pa</foreign>) is
                        beautiful (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">sdug pa</foreign>). Aside
                        from this minor twist, the context remains that of the usual four errors. </p>

                    <p tid="8">Once the Buddha Arisen from Flowers has taught the audience, the
                        king, queen, prince, and the entire retinue all take ordination. The
                        thus-gone one then prophesies Prince Ratnākara’s awakening, revealing his
                        future name, world, lifespan, and the nature of his teachings. Toward the
                        end of the sūtra, Buddha Śākyamuni reveals the current identity of the main
                        characters of his narrative. Arisen from Flowers has now become the buddha
                        Amitābha, and Ratnākara has become the bodhisattva known as Avalokiteśvara. In the
                        remainder of the sūtra, Śākyamuni reveals that anyone who faithfully
                        receives this Dharma teaching will be reborn in Sukhāvatī (the buddha realm
                        of Amitābha) and that all women who touch or read this sūtra will be able to
                        exchange their female bodies for male forms and never again take rebirth in
                        a female body.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-005-11" index="5">This notion 
                            that women might be obliged to turn into or be reborn as men in order to awaken to 
                            buddhahood, somewhat jarring to modern sensibilities, is a common idea found
                        throughout Mahāyāna literature. For more on this theme, see Nattier (2002). Statements of this kind are partially 
                        counterbalanced by passages in other sūtras in which the role of gender 
                        is downplayed or deconstructed.</note> </p>

                    <p tid="9">The title of the sūtra could be interpreted in a number of different ways, some of which would require translations other than the one we have chosen. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">Chos</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dharma</foreign>) could refer to qualities, factors, practices, states, phenomena, or the teachings, while <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">don</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">artha</foreign>), too, has a wide range of meanings including object, referent, goal, purpose, worth, use, meaning, and cause. We have inevitably had to narrow the possibilities down to produce a rendering in English.<note place="end" index="6" xml:id="UT22084-066-005-101">In translating <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">don</foreign> as “what is meaningful,” we have taken as one of the only available cues the single occurrence of the word in the text—in the third line of <ptr target="#UT22084-066-005-35"/>. Although the translation of this line renders <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">chos</foreign> as “the Dharma” rather than as “phenomena,” the play between the different meanings of this word in this and the following stanza in the source text, and the possible ambiguities that result, are probably intentional. </note>

                    <p tid="10">There is no extant Sanskrit version of this scripture, and the sūtra
                        does not appear to have been translated into Chinese. In producing
                        this translation, we have based our work on the Degé xylograph Kangyur while
                        consulting the Comparative Edition (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe bsdur
                            ma</title>), as well as the Stok Palace manuscript Kangyur. The colophon of the
                        sūtra states that it was translated by the Indian scholars Jinamitra and
                        Dānaśīla, as well as the prolific Tibetan translator Yeshé Dé. We can
                        therefore date the Tibetan translation to the late eighth or early ninth
                        century, and this is confirmed by the text’s inclusion in the early
