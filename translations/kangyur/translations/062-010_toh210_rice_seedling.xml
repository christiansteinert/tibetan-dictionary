                    very brief teaching on dependent arising that the Buddha had given earlier that day while gazing at a rice
                    seedling. The text discusses outer and inner causation and its conditions, describes in detail the twelvefold
                    cycle by which inner dependent arising gives rise to successive lives, and explains how understanding the very
                    nature of that process can lead to freedom from it.</p>

                        the most important sūtras on the topic of dependent arising. In this sūtra Śāriputra approaches Maitreya
                        and requests him to explain the meaning of the following statement of the Buddha, which he had made
                        earlier that same day while gazing at a rice seedling: “Whoever sees dependent arising sees the Dharma.
                        Whoever sees the Dharma sees the Buddha.” What follows is an explanation of dependent arising through the
                        twelve links, the eightfold path of the noble ones, and their relation to outer and inner causes and
                        conditions. Crucially, it is by understanding the very nature of dependent arising that one can be free
                        from it and attain enlightenment.</p>

                        reconstructions have been carried out which are claimed to include about ninety percent of <title xml:lang="en">The Rice Seedling</title>. The first reconstructed edition was prepared by Louis de La
                        Vallée Poussin (1913). Without having access to this, N. Ayaswami Sastri (1950) produced another
                        reconstruction. Another one was produced by V.V. Gokhale (1961). Finally, a thorough comparative study and
                        new reconstructed edition was carried out by N. Ross Reat (1993), taking into account Sanskrit, Tibetan,
                        Pāli, and Chinese sources; Reat also provides a complete English translation. This work also illustrates
                        the many parallel and similar passages in Pāli suttas. </p>

                            Tibetan translation. Louis de La Vallée Poussin (1913, p. 72) and Sastri (1950, p. 3) reconstruct
                                <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">chos kyi sku</foreign> here with <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharmakāya</foreign>, but we prefer—with Reat (p. 30)—the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharmaśarīra</foreign> because it is attested as a possible
                            underlying Sanskrit term for the Tibetan <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">chos kyi sku</foreign>
                            in the next paragraph (cf. Reat, p. 32 n5). Kamalaśīla interprets the term as the pristine wisdom, or
                            suchness, that serves as a basis for the dharmas (i.e., awakened qualities) of a buddha. He states:
                            “ ‘body of Dharma’ demonstrates the cause: that which serves as the cause of the dharmas (i.e.,
                            awakened qualities) of a buddha is pristine wisdom or pristine suchness—the body which is the body of
                            Dharma” (Schoening, vol. 2, p. 473). Reat (ibid.) translates this term as “Dharma-body,” whereas
                            Schoening (vol. 1, p. 237) renders it as “the body consisting of dharma(s).” As indicated by these
                            different interpretations, the semantic range of the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharmaśarīra</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">chos kyi sku</foreign>) can
                            include the interlinked notions of the “corpus” of the Buddha’s “teachings” or “doctrine” (Dharma),
                            the “<term type="ignore">collection</term>” of undefiled “qualities” (dharmas) that make a buddha a
                            buddha, the physical body of the Buddha as an “embodiment” of “ultimate reality” (Dharma) and
                            attendant “awakened qualities,” and, by extension, as Kamalaśīla’s interpretation suggests, the
                            ethereal “body” of pristine wisdom that characterizes the Buddha’s awakening experience. The mutual
                            implications of dharma as “doctrine,” “qualities,” and “reality” (and “phenomena” in general) is an
                            important facet of the term’s multivalence in Buddhist literary sources. For more on the shifting

                            Sanskrit <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">upanaya</foreign>, which Reat renders as “exertion.”
                            Kamalaśīla (Schoening, vol. 2, pp. 483–484) interprets this phrase to mean, “Whoever sees dependent
                            arising in this manner sees the Dharma of accomplishment and the Dharma of fruition, because
                            ultimately everything is the same taste, and because the Buddha Bhagavān too is the nature of the body
                            of the ultimate Dharma which was thus taught. Therefore, it is taught that whoever sees the Dharma
                            thus taught sees the Buddha… Whoever comprehends dependent arising thus taught realizes the Dharma of
                            the noble ones; this means ‘comprehending the Dharma of the ultimate meaning.’ Whoever comprehends the
                            Dharma of the ultimate meaning is endowed with perfect wisdom. Whoever is endowed with perfect wisdom
                            abides in the wisdom of equanimity and thus does not perceive any difference between dependent
                            arising, the Dharma, and the Buddha.” The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Śālistamba</title>[<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ka</title>]-<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ṭīkā</title> attributed to Nāgārjuna
                            (Schoening, vol. 2, p. 393) interprets the phrase as: “ ‘Unsurpassable’ means that that there is no
                            special dharma whatsoever that is superior to this, hence it is ‘unsurpassable.’ ‘Body of Dharma’
                            means the Dharma-body itself. … ‘Buddha’ is so-called because of comprehending dharma(s). Thus, one
                            who sees dependent arising sees the nature of one who awakens to the unexcelled Dharma, beyond further
                            training.” Akin to the reconstruction presented above in note 7, this phrase on its own carries the
                            semantic range of the Buddha as an embodiment of the unsurpassable nature of “reality” (Dharma), the
                            unsurpassable “doctrine” (Dharma) that teaches it, and the unsurpassable “qualities” of awakening
                            (dharmas) incumbent upon becoming an awakened one (Buddha). Reat (p. 32) translates the phrase as “he
                            sees the unsurpassable Dharma-body, the Buddha, by exertion based on right knowledge in clear
                            understanding of the noble Dharma.” Schoening (vol. 1, p. 241) translates the final section as, “sees
                            the Buddha, the body consisting of unsurpassable dharma(s).” In interpreting “unsurpassable” to modify
                            “dharma,” and not the whole phrase “body of dharma,” we attempt to follow the interpretations of the
                            commentaries and Schoening. We also leave “dharma” untranslated here in an attempt to capture
                            something of the multiple entendre of the term. See Harrison (1992) for observations about possibly
