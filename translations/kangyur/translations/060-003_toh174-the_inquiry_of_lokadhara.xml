                    Lokadhara asks the Buddha to explain the proper way for bodhisattvas to discern
                    the characteristics of phenomena and employ that knowledge to attain awakening.
                    In reply, the Buddha teaches at length how to understand the lack of inherent
                    existence of phenomena. As part of the teaching, the Buddha explains in detail
                    the nonexistence of the aggregates, the elements, the sense sources, dependently
                    originated phenomena, the four applications of mindfulness, the five powers, the
                    eight aspects of the path of the noble ones, and mundane and transcendent

                    the guidance of Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche. The translation from the Tibetan was
                    produced by Timothy Hinkle. Andreas Doctor checked the translation against the
                    Tibetan, edited the text, and wrote the introduction. James Gentry subsequently
                    compared the translation against Kumārajīva’s Chinese translation and made
                    further edits.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Inquiry of Lokadhara</title> is a scripture
                        that belongs to the general sūtra section of the Degé Kangyur. As far as we
                        are aware, no Sanskrit version of this text remains. However, in addition to
                        the Tibetan translation, which we have translated here, the sūtra is also
                        present in two Chinese translations (T. 481 and T. 482). The first of these
                        was translated by Dharmarakṣa (233–311 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>), the
                        famed and prolific translator of <title xml:lang="en">The Lotus
                            Sūtra</title>. The second translation was completed between 402 and 412
                            <hi rend="small-caps">ce,</hi> by the equally renowned translator
                        Kumārajīva (344–413 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>), as one of his last
                        translations. We therefore know that the text has been in existence since at
                        least the third century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. Unfortunately,
                        however, we know little else of the history of this sūtra. We do not even
                        know when, or by whom, it was translated into Tibetan; the translation does
                        not identify a translator, and the text is not listed in the ninth-century
                        Denkarma (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">ldan dkar
                        ma</foreign>) or Phangthangma (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">’phang thang ma</foreign>) imperial catalogues of Tibetan
                            translations.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-060-003-4" index="1">
                            Herrmann-Pfandt, 2008.</note> It does, however, appear in Buton’s (Tib.

                            ’byung</title>), thus suggesting that it was translated after the fall
                        of the Yarlung dynasty (846 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>) (or at least
                        outside official circles of imperial influence), and only became known in
                        Tibet sometime prior to the fourteenth century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. A cursory search of the Dunhuang manuscript catalogues did not
                        yield any further information, although future studies of these resources
                        may shed new light on this issue. In this regard, it is worth mentioning
                        that Cornelius Chang (1976, p. 22) reports that a fragment of the sūtra was
                        discovered in Turfan (in modern day Xinjiang). The sūtra is therefore likely
                        to have been present in the Dunhuang region as well, as the Tibetan Yarlung
                        Dynasty controlled Turfan during the same period that it controlled
                        Dunhuang, until roughly 846 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-060-003-5"/>
                    <p tid="8">For this translation, we took as our basis the Tibetan Degé xylograph
                        version and compared it to the Stok Palace manuscript and the variant
                        readings recorded in the Comparative Edition (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">dpe bsdur ma</foreign>). Furthermore, we
                        compared the Tibetan with the Chinese translations. This comparison revealed
                        strong affinities between the Tibetan translation and the Chinese
                        translations, specifically that of Kumārajīva. Indeed, the similarities in
                        structure and content between the Tibetan translation and Kumārajīva’s
                        translation (T. 482) are so striking that this Chinese translation, or a
                        related copy thereof, was likely the source text for the Tibetan. The minor
                        variations between it and the Tibetan can mostly be attributed to the
                        several centuries of editorial work that both the source text and the target
                        text underwent since the time of the translation. There are also further
                        indications that this text was translated into Tibetan from the Chinese. For
                        example, the recensions in the Yongle Peking, Lithang, Kangxi Peking,
                        Narthang, and Choné Kangyurs are all missing a Sanskrit title, which is
                        otherwise a customary <term type="ignore">element</term> for texts translated from Sanskrit. Only the
                        Stok Palace and Degé Kangyurs include a Sanskrit title, but this might have
                        been back-translated from the Tibetan and subsequently included by later
                        editors. This and the absence of a translation colophon (another prevalent
                        feature of some of the Tibetan translations from Chinese) suggest that the
                        history of the text might be traced to China.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-060-003-6" index="2"> Alternatively, although less
                            likely, the Sanskrit source text for the Tibetan translation could have
                            been nearly identical to Kumārajīva’s source text.</note>

                    <p tid="9">In comparing the Tibetan to Kumārajīva’s Chinese translation as it
                        appears in Taishō 482, we did not note all minor differences. Rather, we
                        edited the translation in favor of the Chinese wherever it was obvious (or
                        could reasonably be argued) that the Tibetan was an unclear attempt at
                        rendering the Chinese, or was once a clearer rendering prior to subsequent
                        editorial interventions. In cases that were less clear to us, but where the
                        Chinese provided a better reading, we generally adopted the Chinese reading
                        and recorded the Tibetan in annotations.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-060-003-8"/>
                    <p tid="10">Despite the obscurity of the textual history of this sūtra and its
                        infrequent mention in classical and modern writings, the teachings presented
                        herein are certain to be of value to those interested in the world view of
                        the Great Vehicle. Whereas in some sūtras a great number of miracles and
                        visitations from celestial bodhisattvas occur as part of the teaching, this
                        sūtra consists of a lengthy discourse by the Buddha centered on a
                        presentation of traditional Abhidharma categories from the perspective of
                        the Great Vehicle. Unlike the classical presentation of Buddhist ontology,
                        however, this teaching is not concerned with the relative nature and
                        categorization of phenomena, but rather with the inherent emptiness of the
                        categories described and their ultimate lack of reality. In this way, the
                        sūtra presents the topic of metaphysics from a distinctly Great Vehicle
                        perspective that distances itself from traditional Buddhist dharma theory.
                        Rather than emphasizing the unique characteristics and properties of
                        phenomena, the Buddha unifies them all within the single category of
                        emptiness. Throughout the text the terms <distinct>Dharma</distinct> and
                            <distinct>phenomena</distinct> are translations of the same Tibetan term
                            <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">chos</foreign> (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharma</foreign>), which carries both of
                        these meanings in addition to several other meanings that are also implied
                        in this text, such as “awakened qualities,” “truths,” and “trainings.” This
                        text, like much of Buddhist literature in fact, plays repeatedly with the
                        multivalence of dharma(s) to impart a sense of the circularity and mutual
                        implications of the “truths” that buddhas realize about the nature of
                        “phenomena,” the “qualities” achieved through this realization, the
                        “teachings” they give to enable others to realize it, and the “trainings”
                        that these teachings stipulate, leading back, once again, to the discovery
                        of such “truths.” In this regard it is also helpful to keep in mind that the
                        dharmas in Abhidharma theory represent the “bare facts” or ontological
                        building blocks of existence—phenomena the existence of which this text
                        heavily critiques and questions.</p>

                    <p tid="11">Over the course of the sūtra, which is divided into twelve chapters,
                        the Buddha presents the following topics: the five aggregates, the eighteen
                        elements, the twelve sense sources, the twelve links of dependent
                        origination, the four applications of mindfulness, the five powers, the
                        eight aspects of the path of the noble ones, the phenomena of the world and
                        the transcendent, and conditioned and unconditioned phenomena. These
                        subjects provide an important explanatory framework for the functioning of
                        existence and the path to awakening from the Abhidharma point of view.
                        Although some explanation of each topic is given, the sūtra clearly assumes
                        the reader’s familiarity with Abhidharma theory. Moreover, rather than
                        offering a traditional explanation of these topics, the Buddha consistently
                        explains their lack of identifying marks (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">animitta</foreign>), meaning
                        that despite their conventional designations, the phenomena in question do
                        not in actuality have any true or real referents. The Buddha states that
                        these topics are normally taught purely for the expedient purpose of guiding
                        childish ordinary beings (i.e., not the followers of the Great Vehicle)
                        along the path; however, on the ultimate level, the individual
                        characteristics that these phenomena seem to possess due to the
                        interdependent process of causation cannot be found. These subjects are
                        taught merely to provide students with useful classifications that
                        ultimately must lead them beyond such ontological categories. By contrast,
                        this sūtra’s theme is the absence of marks of all phenomena, one of the
                        three <distinct>gateways of liberation</distinct>, which also include
                        emptiness and the absence of wishes. As such, the sūtra represents a clear
                        critique of the traditional vehicle of the hearers and a forceful
                        affirmation of the superiority of the perspective of the Great Vehicle.</p>

                        humans, and a blessed buddha. Lokadhara, the blessed one King of Lofty
                        Wisdom had an immeasurable saṅgha of hearers and an immeasurable saṅgha of
                        bodhisattvas. This was due to the causes and conditions of this Blessed
                        One’s past aspirations. Even the words <distinct>three lower
                            realms</distinct> were unheard of in the blessed one King of Lofty
                        Wisdom’s buddha realm. No one there had experienced any suffering; all in
                        all, everyone there had such an abundance of happiness and joy that they
                        were mostly free of desire, as the five obscurations were eliminated. These

                        Wisdom was one quadrillion eons. The Thus-Gone One acted as the king of the

                        called the Blessed One their <distinct>Dharma King</distinct>. The blessed
                        one King of Lofty Wisdom taught the bodhisattvas a discourse from the

                        purificatory wisdom strength, they generated such strength of diligence that
                        for the rest of their lives, they did not develop the intent to sit; did not
                        develop notions about clothing; did not develop notions about themselves, other
                        beings, men, or women; and did not eat too much food. Rather, they only exerted
                        themselves in this purificatory wisdom strength. When these five hundred
                        bodhisattvas who had exerted themselves so diligently passed away, they were

                        born there, they exerted themselves in this teaching, and before long they
                        remembered their past lives and gained sharp faculties. In that buddha realm

                        <p tid="86">“It is inappropriate for us to emulate childish ordinary beings,
                            <ref cRef="F.21.a" type="folio"/> for we should arouse diligence and earnestly cultivate the
                            factors of awakening. It is appropriate for us to investigate the
                            aggregate of form accurately. When bodhisattvas contemplate the
                            aggregates accurately, they understand them to be like water bubbles.
                            How do they understand them to be like water bubbles? A water bubble
                            does not exist—for it simply occurs due to many conditions and cannot be
                            grasped or held. It is without solidity or a core. For these reasons,
                            water bubbles lack any characteristics of bubbles. Just as the absence
                            of a real bubble can be called a <distinct>water bubble</distinct>, so
                            it is with the aggregate of form, for the aggregate of form lacks the
                            characteristics of an aggregate. When bodhisattvas contemplate this,
                            they reflect as follows: ‘Childish ordinary beings fail to understand
                            the unreal nature of form accurately; they do not understand the
                            impermanence of form accurately; and they do not understand the
                            characteristic of form accurately. However, we have entered the correct
                            path, so we shall not cling to unreal forms. Why is this? Form does not
                            have any characteristic to grasp at, for it is just a mere label,
                            lacking any true characteristics. Thus, because form lacks a true
                            characteristic and has no name, it is called <distinct>form</distinct>.
                            Furthermore, form has the characteristic of being destructible, yet the
                            wise understand it as lacking marks. We must become skilled in
                            cultivating the practice that form has no marks—we should not cling to
                            the marks of form. If a person clings to the marks of form, they are
                            called <distinct>one who clings to form</distinct>. We should become
                            highly skilled in understanding the marks of form. When bodhisattvas
                            understand this accurately, they know how to discern form accurately.
                            <ref cRef="F.21.b" type="folio"/> At that point, they know that the aggregate of form arises from
                            the imputations of childish ordinary beings. The fact that phenomena
                            arise from imputation means that they are unborn. Since all imputations
                            are rooted in and based on the mistaken and false understanding of
                            childish ordinary beings, beings give rise to such
                                <distinct>forms</distinct> and become bound by those forms.
                            Tormented by form, they are pained by suffering and wander throughout
                            saṃsāra. Blinded by ignorance and delusion, they cling to form and
                            cannot let it go; thereby, they regard form as permanent, solid, and
                            having a core. Through this, childish ordinary beings are bound by the
                            fetters of form and wander constantly through the realms of hell-beings,
                            animals, anguished spirits, gods, and humans. They relish the experience
                            of form, for they do not consider the many problems inherent in form. We
                            should not emulate childish ordinary beings; rather, we should cultivate
                            discernment regarding what pertains to form.’</p>

                        <p tid="87">“When cultivating discernment of form, one should view form’s
                            nature as being like a dream. In a dream, the forms one sees arise from
                            imputed perceptions, feelings, and concepts, which arouse sights,
                            sounds, feelings, perceptions, and dependent origination. One then
                            perceives these as self and other. One sees them as earth, water, fire,
                            and wind. One sees them as mountains, lakes, forests, and so on. In this
                            fashion, the marks of the forms in a dream have no definite reality;
                            rather, they come about based on imputed perceptions. The marks of the
                            aggregate of form are produced in the same way; they arise from the
                            causes and conditions of previous actions and do not have a defined

                            Beings, however, grasp and cling to this incorrectly observed form and

                            there, for it is simply clinging. Such clinging is false and arises from
                            false imputations.’ When bodhisattvas think such, they will also think,

                            feelings, and feelings that are neither pleasurable nor painful. When

                            existence. Since formations cannot be observed in the past, cannot be
                            observed in the future, and cannot be observed in-between, they do not
                            remain. Thus, formations arise and cease moment-by-moment.</p>

                        <p tid="103">“Lokadhara, in this fashion bodhisattvas accurately understand
                            the aggregate of formation to be emptiness, inapprehensible, lacking a
                            concrete nature, and not even remotely observable. Considering this,
                            they will correctly reason in the following way with regard to the
                            aggregate of formation: ‘Childish ordinary beings are bound by phenomena
                            that have no essence, by the aggregate of formation, and by their
                            attachment. They generate formations with their body, speech, and mind,
                            and they generate the formations of self and possessions. By generating
                            such action, they are bound by the aggregate of formation and fail to
                            recognize the very aggregate of formation to be ignorance and delusion.
                            Under the power of such mistaken perceptions, beings grasp and cling to
                            formations. <ref cRef="F.27.a" type="folio"/> Since such people become attached and cling to the
                            aggregate of formation in this way, they sometimes generate pleasurable
                            formations, sometimes generate painful formations, and sometimes
                            generate formations that are neither pleasurable nor painful. When
                            generating formations concerning pleasure, such people attain a body
                            that is pleasurable. When generating formations concerning pain, such
                            people attain a body that is painful. When generating formations
                            concerning what is neither pleasurable nor painful, such people attain a
                            body that is neither pleasurable nor painful. When they attain a body
                            that is pleasurable, such people develop desire for it. When they attain
                            a body that is painful, such people develop aversion for it. When they
                            attain a body that is neither pleasurable or painful, such people
                            develop delusion regarding it. Falling under the power of desire,
                            aversion, and delusion, they fail to see the flaws of formations, and so
                            they fail to purify physical, verbal, and mental formations. In failing
                            to purify physical, verbal, and mental formations, they descend into
                            impure paths: those of hell-beings, animals, and anguished spirits. Even
                            if they manage to briefly gain freedom from such states and are born as
                            gods or humans, they remain very attached to physical, verbal, and
                            mental formations; they are still quite attached to the aggregate of
                            formation. Bodhisattva great beings accurately understand this. We too
                            should not emulate childish ordinary beings. Rather, we should train to
                            purify physical, verbal, and mental formations and not become attached
                            to the aggregate of formation. Having thoroughly investigated the flaws
                            of the aggregate of formation, we should seek the path, which brings
                            emancipation from the aggregate of formation.’</p>

                            Bodhisattva great beings contemplate the aggregate of consciousness as a
                            nonaggregate. They contemplate the aggregate of consciousness as a heap
                            of error. They contemplate how the aggregate of consciousness is a heap
                            of falsehood. Why is this so? Lokadhara, the aggregate of consciousness
                            arises from mistaken perception. Because beings have been bound by the
                            condition of false perception, they have previously created actions, due
                            to which the aggregate of consciousness now manifests. Because it also
                            depends upon current conditions, it is based on many causes and
                            conditions. Therefore, the aggregate of consciousness arises from
                            consciousness that is based on nonexistent and false imputations. It is
                            called <distinct>consciousness</distinct> because it is cognizant. It
                            exists adventitiously, based upon a confused conceptual mind. Because it
                            knows, it is called <distinct>consciousness</distinct>. It is called the
                                <distinct>aggregate of consciousness</distinct> because it is
                            conscious of myriad entities, because it initiates mental actions,
                            because it thinks, because it generates marks from many conditions, and
                            because it generates thinking in myriad forms. It is called the
                                <distinct>aggregate of consciousness</distinct> because
                            consciousness causes the forms perceived by consciousness to arise and
                            it manifests the actions of mind, and because it is fond of thinking. It
                            is called mind, mentality, and consciousness.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-060-003-106" index="15"> “Mind, mentality, and

                            of consciousness as existent, and they grasp and cling to the present
                            aggregate of consciousness as existent. Childish ordinary beings become
                            attached to things they see, hear, feel, and cognize as the aggregate of
                            consciousness and thus construe them as being existent. Such people
                            grasp and cling to things they see, hear, feel, and cognize. Bound by
                            the aggregate of consciousness, they highly cherish what they cognize.
                            Under the collective power of mind, mentality, and consciousness, they
                            wander throughout saṃsāra, from this world to the next, and from there
                            to here. Bound by the aggregate of consciousness, they fail to
                            accurately understand the aggregate of consciousness. Since the
                            aggregate of consciousness is false, then all things heard, seen, felt,
                            and cognized have arisen from a mistaken cause, such that there is no
                            accurate consciousness of them. <ref cRef="F.29.b" type="folio"/> In this way, as such people
                            fail to accurately apprehend, at times a virtuous consciousness will
                            arise, at times a nonvirtuous consciousness will arise, and at times a
                            consciousness that is neither virtuous nor nonvirtuous will arise.
                            Although such people always follow after consciousness, they do not
                            recognize the origin of consciousness or the true characteristics of

                            characteristic of being unborn. Why is this? Lokadhara, the aggregate of
                            consciousness is without birth, marks, or existence. The aggregate of
                            consciousness’s characteristic of being born is false; thus it is
                            subsumed within the characteristic of being unborn. Lokadhara, the

                            existence. The characteristics of the aggregate of consciousness arise
                            from many causes and conditions. Lokadhara, when bodhisattva great
                            beings contemplate dependently originated phenomena in this manner, they
                            realize the aggregate of consciousness to be a nonaggregate. Having

                            understand and realize everything designated as consciousness. Once
                            bodhisattvas understand how to disengage from the aggregate of
                            consciousness, they will overcome all apprehensions and objects of
                            knowledge. Lokadhara, this is how bodhisattva great beings understand
                            the aggregate of consciousness. When they understand the aggregate of
                            consciousness to be unborn, uncreated, unarisen, imperceptible, and
                            ungraspable, they see that it arises from many conditions and appears
                            due to the gathering of many conditions. Although it comes into

                            cognized, it is primordially empty. When contemplating the aggregate of
                            consciousness in this manner, they understand the aggregate of
                            consciousness to be uncreated and unarisen. They do not cling to it or

                            cease. In terms of the embryonic stage, the five aggregates for
                            appropriation are synonymously labeled <distinct>a human

                            can properly understand the subtle characteristics of arising and
                            ceasing of the five aggregates for appropriation while in the womb,

                            transcends all worldly insight. <ref cRef="F.32.b" type="folio"/> Bodhisattva great beings gain
                            the acceptance that phenomena are unborn and enter the domain of the

                            not dependent on other factors. Having naturally discovered wisdom,

                            construed to be desired, whether outer or inner, is appropriated;
                            existence is appropriated; as are things seen, heard, felt, cognized; as

                            consciousness. Beings grasp and crave for the coarse marks of
                            name-and-form, and appropriate them. They appropriate form, conjoin
                            themselves with form, and are bound by form. Moreover, they appropriate
                            the four remaining formless aggregates, conceptualizing and labeling

                            five aggregates. Thereby they fail to understand the nature of the five
                            aggregates, and they do not understand that emptiness is the

                            teachings of the Buddha, they will be liberated from the suffering of
                            hell-beings, animals, and anguished spirits. <ref cRef="F.35.a" type="folio"/> Lokadhara, the
                            Blessed Buddha does not debate with others. Because he has ceased all
                            debate, he is called <distinct>Buddha</distinct>, and he teaches to all
                            beings the genuine Dharma, namely this: ‘All that you have previously
                            appropriated was mistaken. Due to being mistaken, all beings cling to
                            and depend upon the five aggregates, and thereby they repeatedly cycle
                            throughout the world.’ In this way, people who cling to and depend upon
                            the five aggregates will develop and cling to myriad wrong views. They
                            cling to and depend upon various terms and words. They cling to and
                            depend upon sorrow, lamentation, and suffering. Thus, people are
                            afflicted with various wrong views and are thus harmed by many forms of
                            suffering; but still, their views never become their protector, refuge,
                            base, or support, for only the blessed buddhas can protect and offer
                            refuge. Childish ordinary beings are small-minded and have limited
                            understanding. They are attached to the five sense pleasures and cling
                            to the five aggregates, which are rife with problems. Childish ordinary
                            beings argue with those who protect, offer refuge, provide support, and
                            deliver from all suffering. Lokadhara, I have raised my hand. I am not
                            the teacher of those who view in terms of the five aggregates, view the
                            five aggregates in terms of marks, or who become attached to the five
                            aggregates. They are not my students. They are not my ordained. They are
                            not my followers. They do not take refuge in me. Such people have set
                            out on the path to the lower realms and entered the incorrect path. They
                            do not follow the truth. They are mistaken. They fail to understand what
                            the Buddha knows and teaches. They fail to understand what the Buddha
                            knows and teaches about the five aggregates. <ref cRef="F.35.b" type="folio"/> They fail to
                            understand what the Buddha teaches concerning the ultimate. Thus, by not
                            following the Buddha’s teachings, they should not receive veneration and
                            offerings. I do not permit them to be ordained, much less to receive the
                            honor of veneration and offerings from others. Why is this? Because such
                            people are included in the ranks of the non-Buddhists. Such people, who
                            produce marks concerning the five aggregates, are known as those who are

                            walls that were twelve leagues in circumference. They were fashioned
                            from the four precious substances. There were seven layers of moats and
                            fences that were covered with a net of various precious substances. The

                            four precious substances: gold, beryl, crystal, and coral. There were
                            five hundred parks in each city wherein the trees were made of the seven
                            precious substances. Each and every tree was adorned with precious
                            fabrics. In each park were five hundred jeweled ponds filled with water
                            of the eight qualities. Lokadhara, King Bringer of Benefit had eighty

                            beings learned in the eighteen elements? When bodhisattva great beings
                            practice correct contemplation of the eighteen elements, they think,
                            ‘The eye element cannot be observed to be the eye element. There is also
                            no <distinct>I</distinct> or <distinct>mine</distinct> in the eye
                            element. It is impermanent, insubstantial, and empty of inherent nature.
                            Therefore, what is imputed as the characteristic of the eye element
                            cannot be observed in the eye element. The eye element is untrue and
                            totally nonexistent, for it is born from false thinking. The eye element
                            lacks true characteristics, as the space element is the eye element. For
                            instance, just as the space element lacks true characteristics and is
                            not an entity, the eye element also lacks true characteristics and is
                            not an entity. Why is this? <ref cRef="F.38.b" type="folio"/> Because no real entity can be found
                            in the eye element, the eye element does not exist in any location or
                            direction. It does not exist internally, externally, or somewhere
                            in-between. The eye element lacks true characteristics and is not an
                            entity. Thus, no entity of the eye element can be apprehended, for it
                            arises from many causes and conditions. The eye element is neither past,
                            nor present, nor future, and there is no intrinsic nature of the eye to
                            observe in the eye element. The eye element depends upon the ripening of
                            the results of past actions and current conditions, whereupon the eye
                            element is imputed. The eye element is a nonelement. No eye element can
                            be observed in the eye element. The so-called eye element refers to the
                            domain of consciousness. The <distinct>eye element</distinct> manifests
                            when three factors come together: a clear eye faculty, an apparent form,
                            and the involvement of the mind faculty. The eye element lacks anything
                            that can be called a <distinct>real eye element</distinct>, and the wise
                            understand the eye element to be the absence of the eye element.’ ”</p>

                            any true characteristics, it is called the <distinct>form
                                element</distinct>. If form is insubstantial, lacking even concepts
                            of it, what need is there to mention the so-called form element? Because
                            the so-called form element is not an entity, the characteristic of form
                            does not exist within form, outside of form, or somewhere in-between.
                            Rather, it is imputed. Form appears due to the combination of a location
                            where forms can appear, the presence of an uncorrupted eye faculty,
                            <ref cRef="F.39.a" type="folio"/> and the involvement of the mind consciousness. This is called
                            the <distinct>characteristic of form</distinct>. It is similar to a
                            reflection in a mirror. If the mirror is unblemished, the characteristic
                            of form will appear in it. But form in fact has no true characteristics;
                            the reflection of a form appears in the mirror even as there is no
                            person there. Further, even if there is a mirror outside, the
                            characteristic of form arises from within. Similarly, when an
                            uncorrupted eye faculty is present in a location where forms are
                            visible, much like the reflection in a mirror, the resulting
                            apprehension can be labeled the<distinct> characteristic of
                                form</distinct>. Form is devoid of elements, shapes, and true
                            characteristics. These are the so-called characteristics of form.
                            Because the characteristics of form are devoid of self, they are called
                            the <distinct>characteristics of form</distinct>. Because they are
                            perceived according to the individual in question, they are called the
                                <distinct>characteristics of form</distinct>. Any person who
                            understands the characteristics of form also understands the
                            characteristics of the absence of form. If one understands the
                            characteristics of form as an unborn element, one will also understand
                            the characteristics of form to be an uncreated element. Why is this? The
                            characteristics of form are neither past, nor present, nor future. The
                            demonstrated lack of inherent characteristics, the demonstrated
                            characteristic of falsity, and the demonstrated imputed characteristics

                            The wise do not observe the eye-consciousness element as the
                            eye-consciousness element. Since the eye-consciousness element cannot be
                            observed as the eye-consciousness element, <ref cRef="F.40.a" type="folio"/> it cannot be found
                            to be an entity. Why is this? The eye-consciousness element lacks true
                            characteristics. The eye-consciousness element is nothing more than a
                            mere imputation. The expression <distinct>element</distinct> is merely
                            an expression that means <distinct>non-appropriation</distinct>. When
                            there is something to be seen, the characteristic of the eye
                            consciousness arises from the function of the eye consciousness and
                            mind. This is called <distinct>eye consciousness</distinct>. Knowledge
                            of conditional characteristics arises from the gathering of three
                            things: the eye element, the form element, and the eye-consciousness
                            element. Although they are devoid of the substance of an element, it is
                            due to the categories of the eye element, the form element, and the
                            eye-consciousness element that beings can enter the genuine path. Yet in
                            this, there is not truly an eye element, a form element, or an
                            eye-consciousness element. All the thus-gone ones skillfully explain how
                            to understand, see, and discern characteristics. Those who understand
                            and realize this teaching of characteristics will understand the three
                            realms to be without elements. Why is this? Because the realms lack the
                            characteristics of elements, and the elements cannot be observed as the
                            characteristics of the realms. The ear element, sound element, and
                            ear-consciousness element; the nose element, odor element, and
                            nose-consciousness element; the tongue element, taste element, and
                            tongue-consciousness element; and the body element, tactile element, and
                            body-consciousness element should also be understood in this way.”</p>

                            stimulated by the wind, a sprout will gradually grow. The sprout has not
                            arisen from the seed, and the seed is not the same as the sprout. Once
                            the sprout arises, the seed perishes. Yet, the seed is not other than
                            the sprout, and the sprout is not other than the seed. Just as the seed

                            The mental-object element is an indeterminate element. Because the
                            mental-object element cannot be observed as inherently existent, it also
                            cannot be observed to be any definite thing. Still, the <distinct>mental
                                object element</distinct> is described and taught in order to bring
                            understanding to beings who see mistakenly and who are bound by falsity.
                            The mental-object element is explained in order to establish ordinary
                            beings with an understanding of the absence of elements. Why is this?
                            The mental-object element has no mental-object element, for the
                            so-called mental-object element arises from a gathering of many
                            conditions. Phenomena that arise from a gathering of many conditions
                            have no intrinsic nature. Because causes and conditions have no
                            intrinsic nature, causes and conditions arise from a stream of mistaken
                            perception that is itself a gathering of many factors. The Thus-Gone One
                            thus teaches the mental-object element in order to ripen beings, using
                            conventional language to illustrate the absence of elements. Even though
                            the mental-object element does not exist internally, externally, or
                            somewhere in-between, in order to cause beings to understand and see
                            virtuous and nonvirtuous phenomena, he explains with recourse to the
                                <distinct>mental-object element</distinct> the absence of all

                            taught to ultimately be emptiness. Why is this? The mental-object
                            element is totally nonexistent, because there are no actual marks of
                            existence in the mental-object element. For instance, just as space has
                            no true characteristics, but is still called <distinct>space</distinct>,
                            the mental-object element likewise has no real marks. The mental-object
                            element is taught in order to destroy the marks of mental objects, for
                            the mental-object element is a nonelement. Why is this? The

                            multiple. The mental-object element does not have many marks of the
                            mental-object element, nor does it have even a few. Through the skillful
                            means of demonstrating elements, the mental-object element is described
                            as an <distinct>element</distinct>. Those practitioners who understand
                            and realize the mental-object element see and understand it to be a
                            nonelement. There are no conceptual marks related to the mental-object
                            element throughout the three realms. But because beings imagine there to
                            be mental objects, due to a combination of many causes and conditions,
                            the <distinct>mental-object element</distinct> is taught. The
                            mental-object element is thus explained to show how mental objects are
                            differentiated and have no definite characteristics.</p>

                            no birth, because the mental-object element is primordially unborn. Why
                            is this? Because the mental-object element is devoid of elements.
                            Moreover, because the mental-object element is formed, it does not
                            exist. Moreover, because it is not formed, not dispersed, not assembled,

                            they contemplate them? They think as follows: ‘There is no desire realm
                            in the desire realm. There is no form realm in the form realm. There is
                            no formless realm in the formless realm. However, by using realms to
                            demonstrate those phenomena that are devoid of a realm, the desire realm
                            is shown to those who prefer to enter the desire realm, the form realm
                            is shown to those who prefer to enter the form realm, and the formless
                            realm is shown to those who prefer to enter the formless realm. The
                            absence of realms is indicated and articulated by using realms. The wise
                            understand the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm to
                            be utterly nonexistent realms. The wise do not observe the desire realm,
                            the form realm, or the formless realm. By understanding that the three
                            realms are devoid of inherent existence and fixed qualities, but arise
                            from many causes and conditions, the wise thus understand the three
                            realms to be nonrealms. There are no realms, but the three realms
                            manifest due to falsity and mistaken perception. Why is this? Since the
                            wise do not observe the three realms, the three realms cannot be
                            observed or described as belonging to the past, present, or future. The

                            perception. The Thus-Gone One distinguishes between and explains them in

                            that beings can understand the meaning of nonrealm; for in truth, they

                            way, they understand others’ elements and their own elements to be the
                            element of space, for they understand them to be the nonexistent
                            mental-object element, the element of nonexistence, and the unborn
                            element. Why is this? Their own elements and others’ elements are not
                            different or distinct from the element of space. All such elements
                            emerge from space, but since they are born from many conditions, they
                            are known as <distinct>elements</distinct>, as there is no fixed
                            characteristic of elements among them. Why is this? It is because space
                            has no definitive element. Given that all characteristics are included
                            in the element of space, this is the meaning of the absence of realms.
                            Just as space has no elements, phenomena too are ultimately without
                            marks and have the characteristic of nonexistence. All elements are free
                            from elements. Since there is no element in an element,
                                <distinct>elements</distinct> do not exist internally, externally,
                            or somewhere in-between. There is no element within an element. That
                            absence is not included among characteristics and does not depend on an
                            element. All elements are devoid of a locus. All elements are unborn.
                            The wise do not observe elements arising, ceasing, or abiding in the
                            elements. All elements are unborn, unarisen, nonabiding, and
                            primordially unobservable. The wise do not become attached to elements,
                            which are mere labels. They do not become attached to, grasp at, or
                            conceptualize them. <ref cRef="F.44.a" type="folio"/> Therefore, the wise see and understand all
                            elements to be unborn elements. Since all elements are unborn, they are
                            unceasing; thus, on the ultimate level, no element can be observed.
                            Relatively, mental-object elements are distinguished and discussed, but
                            on the ultimate level there is nothing at all that can be described as
                            an <distinct>element</distinct>. Thus do the wise understand and realize
                            the definitive meaning of all elements.</p>

                            are bodhisattva great beings knowledgeable about the twelve sense
                            sources? When discerning the twelve sense sources, they think, ‘The eye
                            sense source cannot be observed in the eye. In the eye, there is no
                            definitive eye sense source. The eye sense source cannot be observed to
                            be an entity.’ Why is this? The eye sense source is born from many
                            causes and conditions and arises through mistaken perception. It depends
                            upon form, because it observes form. When the two meet,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-060-003-177" index="38"> The eye and form.</note>
                            the condition of form brings the condition of the eye sense source into
                            existence. Because the form and eye sense sources are mutually
                            dependent, they are collectively called <distinct>the eye’s
                                form</distinct>. Regarding the so-called <distinct>eye
                            </distinct>and <distinct>form</distinct>, form is the gateway through
                            which the eye sense source is generated, and the eye also generates and
                            illuminates the form sense source. Therefore, with regard to the sense
                            sources, the <distinct>eye sense source</distinct> is so-called because
                            it is labeled a <distinct>sense source gateway</distinct> via the
                            condition of form and the <distinct>form sense source</distinct> is
                            so-called because it is seen by the eye. While I teach that they do
                            exist relatively, the eye does not exist in form, form does not exist in
                            the eye, the eye does not exist in the eye, and form does not exist in
                            form. The <distinct>eye sense source</distinct> is thus labeled because
                            observation of form arises from many conditions. Additionally, the
                                <distinct>form sense source</distinct> is thus labeled because the
                            eye consciousness and the characteristic of sight arise through
                            dependent origination.</p>

                        <p tid="170">“How is it that, contrary to what is mistakenly claimed on the
                            relative level, ultimately, the eye sense source and the form sense
                            source are both taught to be unobservable? When the wise seek the sense
                            sources, they do not see them as truly existent. Childish ordinary
                            beings with mistaken perception speak of the eye sense source and the
                            form sense source as two entities. I have taught that the eye sense
                            source and the form sense source <ref cRef="F.46.a" type="folio"/> are false sense sources. In
                            order to bring about an accurate understanding of the true
                            characteristics of phenomena, I have said that the sense sources arise
                            due to dependent origination, in association with delusion; and thus,
                            the characteristic of sense sources cannot be truly observed therein.
                            Why is this? The eye and form sense sources do not exist internally,
                            externally, or somewhere in-between. The eye and form sense sources are
                            not past, present, or future. However, since form is perceived due to a
                            gathering of causes and conditions in the present moment, it is called
                            the <distinct>eye sense source</distinct>; this accords with what is
                            experienced by childish ordinary beings. By understanding that the sense
                            sources are false, nonexistent, and arisen from mistaken imputation, the
                            wise see and understand that the sense sources are not sense sources.
                            They do not speak of the characteristics of the sense sources, and they
                            understand that the sense sources have no fixed characteristics, yet the
                            wise teach them to be dependently originated. The Thus-Gone One has said
                            that these sense sources are known and understood; namely,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-060-003-179" index="39"> Sentence parsed according to the

                            that the sense sources are false, nonexistent, dependent upon causes and
                            conditions, and arisen from mistaken formations. The sense sources are
                            uncreated and devoid of agent. The eye sense source cannot be known or
                            conceived in relation to the form sense source, nor can the form sense
                            source be known or conceived in relation to the eye sense source; both
                            are devoid of marks. By virtue of the characteristic of being void in
                            reality, the sense sources are beyond investigation and description.
                            Since the characteristic of the sense sources arises in dependence,
                            childish beings mistakenly apprehend them, while the noble ones
                            correctly understand and know them. They know that the eye and form
                            sense sources are characterized as being unborn, unceasing, and without
                            coming or going. <ref cRef="F.46.b" type="folio"/> Thus, the eye does not perceive the eye, the
                            eye does not conceptualize the eye, form does not perceive form, and
                            form does not conceptualize form. Why is this? Because both are empty.
                            Because both are void, the characteristic of the eye cannot be known via
                            the eye, and the characteristic of form cannot be known via form. Both
                            eye and form lack characteristics and qualities. Since they lack true
                            characteristics, the eye is not created by the eye, the eye cannot be
                            understood by the eye, form is not created by form, and form cannot be
                            understood by form. Because both are nonexistent, the eye does not
                            think, ‘I am the eye,’ and form does not think, ‘I am form.’ The
                            identity of both eye and form is essentially an illusion, and so eye and
                            form are also synonyms for falsity. Bodhisattvas likewise discern and
                            contemplate ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, and body and
                            texture in the same manner as the eye and form sense sources.”</p>

                            contemplate the mind sense source? When bodhisattva great beings discern
                            and contemplate the mind sense source, they think, ‘The mind sense
                            source is unobservable. There are no true characteristics of a sense
                            source in the mind. The mind sense source is insubstantial.’ Why is
                            this? The mind sense source arises from mistaken perception, through the
                            process of dependent origination. Since it depends upon the
                            mental-object sense source, it performs its function based on the
                            meeting of the two.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-060-003-181" index="40"> Read according to Stok, Yongle,
                                Kangxi, Choné, and the Chinese.</note> The mind sense source occurs
                            because of the condition of the mental-object sense source. It is
                            discerned through the condition of the mental-object sense source, and
                            its characteristic is twofold. The mental-object sense source finds its
                            locus in dependence upon the mind. Mind is the gateway of the arising
                            and development of mental objects, and the mental-object sense source is
                            likewise the gateway of the mind. Therefore, <ref cRef="F.47.a" type="folio"/> it is termed
                                the<distinct> mental-object sense source</distinct>. The
                                <distinct>mind sense source</distinct> is named as such due to it
                            being the gateway of the mental-object sense source. The
                                <distinct>mental-object sense source</distinct> is taught in order
                            to demonstrate and bring about knowledge of the gateway of the mind’s
                            characteristics. Although the relative truth is expressed correctly, the
                            mind does not rely upon mental objects, and mental objects do not rely
                            upon the mind. Yet, the mind sense source is so-called because it
                            dependently originates, and mental objects are its conditions; while the
                            mental-object sense source is so-called because it demonstrates
                            dependent origination and the characteristics of the mind. These are
                            explained according to delusional perception on the relative level,
                            whereas on the ultimate level, the mind sense source and mental-object
                            sense source are said to be unobservable. Upon investigation, the wise

                            mental-object sense sources are false and nonexistent. Since the

                            follows: the sense sources are false, nonexistent, arisen from mistaken
                            formations, and dependent upon causes and conditions; the mind sense
                            source and mental-object sense source are uncreated, devoid of action,
                            and devoid of agent; the mental-object sense source cannot be known or
                            conceived by the mind sense source; and the mind sense source cannot be

                            this? It is due to the absence of them both. By virtue of thus being
                            devoid of two characteristics, no divisions can be made between them.
                            Even though these sense sources are dependently originated, they are
                            taught according to the mistaken thinking of childish ordinary beings.

                            come, and does not go. The mind cannot be understood by the mind or
                            conceptualized to be the mind. Mental objects cannot be understood by
                            mental objects or conceptualized by mental objects. This is because both
                            of them are empty. Because both are void, the mind cannot understand the
                            characteristics of mind, and mental objects cannot understand the
                            characteristics of mental objects. Since both of them have nonexistent
                            characteristics, they have no actual qualities whatsoever. Mind cannot
                            either create or destroy mind. Mental objects cannot either create or
                            destroy mental objects. Because neither exists, the mind sense source
                            does not think, ‘I am the mind sense source,’ and the mental object
                            sense source does not think, ‘I am the mental object sense source.’ Both
                            are empty and thus illusory; yet they are distinguished and labeled in

                            In this regard, the eye is the gateway of form, because it generates
                            both desire and aversion. Form is also the gateway of the eye, because
                            it also generates both desire and aversion. The same is true of the ear,

                        Bodhisattva great beings discern and contemplate the twelve links of
                        dependent origination as follows: <distinct>Ignorance</distinct> is so
                        designated because of nonexistence. Ignorance is so designated because it
                        lacks qualities. Ignorance is so designated because it cannot understand
                        knowledge. How is ignorance unable to understand knowledge? Ignorance is
                        called <distinct>ignorance</distinct> because it has no fixed qualities to
                        observe. For what reason does the condition of ignorance give rise to
                        formations? All phenomena<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-060-003-191" index="42"> The Chinese reads <foreign xml:lang="zh" type="term">行</foreign>, “formations”
                            here.</note> are nonexistent, but childish ordinary beings form them,
                        thus it is said that ignorance causes formations. Because consciousness
                        arises from formations, it depends upon the condition of formations.
                        Name-and-form are two characteristics, and therefore name-and-form are
                        created by the condition of consciousness. The six sense sources are based
                        upon the condition of name-and-form, because the six sense sources arise
                        from name-and-form. Contact is based upon the condition of the six sense
                        sources, because contact arises from the six sense sources. Feeling is based
                        upon the condition of contact, because feeling arises from contact. Craving
                        is based upon the condition of feeling, because craving arises from feeling.
                        Grasping is based upon the condition of craving, because grasping arises
                        from craving. Becoming is based upon the condition of grasping, because
                        becoming arises from grasping. Birth is based upon the condition of
                        becoming, because birth arises from becoming. Based upon the condition of
                        birth, there arises aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, and the great mass of
                        suffering. In this way aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, and the great mass
                        of suffering are so designated because of birth. In this manner, the great
                        mass of suffering arises. This process is all-subsuming: with a mistaken
                        perception, one contravenes knowledge and accumulates a mass of ignorance.
                        This generates desire for another existence, and based on one’s preferences
                        and attachments, one seeks birth in all such places—this is the aggregate of
                        existence. <ref cRef="F.49.b" type="folio"/>

                        abyss of ignorance. Preceded by ignorance, the entire process of the twelve
                        links of dependent origination manifests. When bodhisattvas investigate the
                        true characteristic of ignorance in this manner, they understand ignorance
                        itself to be emptiness, and thus its point of origin to be unobservable. Why
                        is this? Since ignorance is nonexistent, the point of origin is nonexistent.

                            cannot find even a single hair that is clean and pleasing. This body is

                            What are origination and appropriation in this context? That the body

                            falsity, like something created by a machine. Because it occurs from the
                            causes and conditions of past actions, it is inappropriate to generate
                            the perception of the body as <distinct>I</distinct> or

                            lives.’ When bodhisattvas contemplate accurately in this fashion, they
                            do not observe the body as coming together or separating. <ref cRef="F.55.b" type="folio"/> They
                            do not see the body as coming from somewhere, going somewhere, or
                            abiding anywhere. They do not think that this body exists in the past,
                            present, or future. Thus, they do not rely on the body or life-force,

                            <distinct>mine</distinct>. They discard grasping to the body. Such
                            bodhisattvas realize this body to be emptiness, selfless, and unowned.
                            Because they do not observe this body as <distinct>I</distinct> or
                                <distinct>mine</distinct>, they do not observe it as having physical

                            characteristics of the body, they have no expectations of engaging the
                            body, so there is no way for the body to be produced or arise. What does
                                <distinct>engagement</distinct> mean in this case? It is that the
                            body lacks creation or arising. Because this body has the characteristic
                            of being uncreated and unarisen, it is born of many causes and
                            conditions. The body comes into being through the gathering of causes

                            mistaken, empty, and insubstantial. The body is born of such causes and
                            conditions. Because such causes and conditions themselves are unborn and
                            without marks, when one is contemplating the body in this way, one will
                            understand that the body has the characteristic of being unborn. Having

                            Why is this? Because the mind has no real nature or true

                            wrong and mistaken actions. They understand all actions to be false,
                            nonexistent, unconditioned, and unarisen. Why is this? Because all
                            action lacks true characteristics, and because all action has ceased, it
                            is known as <distinct>right action</distinct>. Right action is not
                            conceptualizing actions as right or wrong. By understanding the sameness
                            of action, one does not think of it in terms of right or wrong.
                            Therefore, it is right action. Right action means nonattachment to the
                            three realms; it means accurate knowledge and understanding. Since
                            actions are sameness within the true nature, they are not conceptualized

                            accurately to be right action in this way, they do not perceive or see

                            profit-seeking is eliminated, the absence of thoughts, then the absence

                            livelihood. In not conceptualizing right livelihood as wrong or right
                            livelihood, one gains pure and right livelihood in all respects.
                            Therefore, this is the attainment of pure and right livelihood.
                            Furthermore, since all forms of livelihood are unborn, there is no right
                            or wrong. A person who knows this achieves pure livelihood, is steadfast
                            on the right path, and is free of concepts. When abiding in such right
                            livelihood, one does not take up right livelihood or abandon wrong
                            livelihood. Therefore, one is abiding in right livelihood. At such time,
                            one is not abiding in what is right or what is wrong. One has attained
                            the livelihood of purity and sameness. Since one is free of any marks of
                            livelihood, one is free of concepts, one does not conceive of anything,
                            and one does not think in terms of livelihood or non-livelihood. This is

                            <ref cRef="F.65.b" type="folio"/> That being so, right effort involves no creation, production,

                            Bodhisattvas understand diligence to be the lack of diligence, for

                            mindfulness? Bodhisattva great beings understand all forms of
                            mindfulness to be wrong mindfulness. The applications of mindfulness are
                            wrong mindfulness. Why is this? All forms of mindfulness are wrong
                            mindfulness. If one generates mindfulness based on observing an object,
                            that is wrong mindfulness. <distinct>Right mindfulness</distinct> is the
                            absence of thought and mindfulness. Why is this? Because all forms of
                            mindfulness arise from the condition of mistakenly observing in a wrong
                            manner. Therefore, any basis that engenders mindfulness is false. Right
                            mindfulness does not generate or inhibit any object of observation.
                            <ref cRef="F.66.a" type="folio"/> When one observes no object with mindfulness, one is said to be
                            steadfast in right mindfulness, in that there is no basis for wrong
                            mindfulness to arise. In this way, since one knows and understands that
                            all phenomena are false, there is no mindfulness of true phenomena.
                            Therefore, this is known as observing right mindfulness. Right
                            mindfulness does not discern phenomena in terms of wrong mindfulness and
                            right mindfulness. By knowing and understanding that all forms of
                            mindfulness lack the marks of mindfulness, bodhisattvas continuously
                            practice the six mental states of equanimity. This, therefore, is
                            abiding in right mindfulness. Because they are free from attachment and
                            clinging, they are without mindfulness and thinking. All forms of
                            mindfulness with regard to phenomena are understood to be sameness. By
                            seeing and understanding all forms of mindfulness accurately, they do
                            not appropriate or discard mindfulness or non-mindfulness. Therefore,
                            they observe right mindfulness. With this mindfulness they do not
                            discern in terms of sameness and difference. They neither perceive nor
                            observe mindfulness nor non-mindfulness. Without such observations,
                            bodhisattvas understand all forms of mindfulness to be non-mindfulness,
                            and they do not distinguish between mindfulness and non-mindfulness.
                            Because they abide in right mindfulness in this way, they are
                            indescribable and inexpressible. They eliminate all means of verbal
                            description and are free from all means of verbal description. By
                            understanding all means of verbal description accurately, they do not
                            draw distinctions between self and other. Therefore, this is abiding in

                            any phenomenon as absorption—[such as] by perceiving absorption to have
                            marks, or by entering the joy of absorption—they understand the falsity

                            attachment, which is not present in absorption. Regarding the marks that
                            result from engaging in observation, bodhisattvas are devoid of such
                            false marks. They have no such expectations, do not form any such
                            thoughts, and do not have any such concepts. This is absorption. If they
                            have eliminated attachment and clinging, they will not conceptualize
                            self or other. Having eliminated all attachment to joy, they do not
                            appropriate the experience of absorption and prevent themselves from
                            entering absorption. <distinct>Right absorption</distinct> is when the
                            mind does not dwell on anything at all. Furthermore, right absorption
                            entails not abiding in any states of absorption; it entails realizing
                            the intrinsic nature of phenomena accurately, while being free from
                            concepts. Thereby, one will become skilled in the characteristics of
                            absorption, and one’s mind will not be attached to anything at all. It
                            is called <distinct>right absorption</distinct> because it eliminates
                            all concepts of self and other, because it does not conceptualize
                            anything that is spoken, and because it disrupts all concepts.
                            Furthermore, it is called <distinct>right absorption</distinct> because
                            it does not entertain any notions of right or wrong absorption, because
                            it overcomes all notions, because it disrupts all notions, and because
                            it stops all notions. Furthermore, it is called right absorption because
                            it does not generate concepts of right or wrong, and because it does not
                            discern in terms of right or wrong. Why is this? By understanding all
                            practices as absorption and by abiding in right absorption, bodhisattvas
                            are not bound by absorption or the marks of absorption. Transcending the
                            marks of absorption is abiding in right absorption. Furthermore, right
                            absorption is free from concepts about any phenomenon, <ref cRef="F.67.a" type="folio"/> and it
                            is free from concepts of right or wrong with regard to phenomena, which
                            are sameness. Right absorption is the sameness of all phenomena. Right
                            absorption transcends all forms of absorption and all the conditioned
                            phenomena of the three realms. Still, it accurately sees and understands
                            all who cycle among the five classes of beings.”</p>

                            <distinct>Transcendence</distinct> is a primordial and genuine
                        disengagement from worldly phenomena. Why is this? The wise do not observe
                        either worldly phenomena or transcendent phenomena, for they do not observe
                        a locus of worldly and transcendent phenomena. For them, there is nothing
                        that can be imputed as the world or transcendence, for transcendence is
                        mentioned only because of the world, and the true characteristic of the
                        world itself is transcendence. Why is this? The world cannot be observed to
                        have any true characteristics. The characteristic of both the world and
                        transcendence has always been emptiness, because worldly phenomena lack any
                        true characteristics. The world has always had the characteristic of total
                        pacification. By understanding that worldly and transcendent phenomena in
                        this manner cannot be observed, bodhisattvas are not attached to worldly
                        phenomena or transcendence. They have no quarrel with the world, because
                        they do not depend upon or become attached to worldly or transcendent
                        phenomena. Why is this? The wise understand and realize the world to have
                        the characteristic of falsity. By seeing the world as false, they do not
                        conceptualize the world or transcendence. Why is this? Lokadhara, the
                            <distinct>world</distinct> means the five aggregates for appropriation.
                        <ref cRef="F.68.a" type="folio"/> All worldly phenomena are included in this category. Yet, if
                        investigated by the wise, the aggregates do not exist. They do not observe
                        the aggregates as aggregates, or the nature of the aggregates. The
                        aggregates cannot be observed as a locus of coming, as a locus of staying,
                        or as a locus of going. Because the five aggregates, as well as the twelve
                        sense sources and the eighteen elements, cannot be observed or analyzed, and
                        because they are without name, nature, characteristic, or action, they are
                        transcendence.</p>

                        of the world and transcendence, transcendent phenomena are not joined
                        together with worldly phenomena, and transcendent phenomena are also never
                        separate from worldly phenomena. This is how such people see transcendent
                        phenomena as being inseparable from the world, and how they see worldly
                        phenomena as inseparable from transcendent phenomena. Such people do not
                        observe two different forms of conduct, worldly and transcendent. Why is
                        this? Lokadhara, the true characteristic of the world is transcendence. The
                        characteristic of the world cannot be observed in the world, and worldly
                        phenomena cannot be observed in worldly phenomena. Because they are totally
                        nonexistent in this way, realizing and understanding this is transcendence.
                        Lokadhara, given that the world is not different from transcendence, the
                        Blessed Buddha does not appear in the world, and the Thus-Gone One does not
                        teach that worldly phenomena cannot be observed—all worldly phenomena can be
                        accurately seen and understood, because they are unborn. <ref cRef="F.68.b" type="folio"/> Lokadhara,
                        not observing or engaging the world is transcendence. Therefore, understand
                        this point: accurately understanding the world and realizing that it cannot
                        be observed is transcendence. Therefore, the Blessed Buddha appeared in the
                        world and declared, ‘Transcendence means to accurately see and understand
                        how all worldly and transcendent phenomena are indivisible and nondual.’
                        Lokadhara, in this manner the world is incredibly profound and difficult to
                        fathom. Dwelling on worldly phenomena, observing worldly phenomena, hoping
                        for transcendent phenomena, perceiving relative terminology to characterize
                        the ultimate, and dwelling on dualistic phenomena will not lead one to
                        actualize or understand this Dharma. Why is this? Such people fail to
                        understand the world and transcendence, perceiving them as two different
                        things. Lokadhara, if one perceives two different things, one will not know
                        and understand the world and transcendence. Lokadhara, this is how
                        bodhisattva great beings are highly skilled regarding the phenomena of the
                        world and transcendence, and these are the means they obtain with regard to

                        through the condition of duality, they are labeled as conditioned phenomena.
                        Conditioned phenomena are uncreated and free from a creator. Since they are
                        naturally arising, they cannot be generated. Thus, they are called
                        conditioned phenomena. Conditioned phenomena do not exist internally,
                        externally, or somewhere in-between; they are not one or many. They arise
                        from false imputation. They are nonexistent, since they have arisen through
                        ignorance. Though they can be perceived due to formations, they are
                        uncreated and nonarising. Therefore, they are called
                            <distinct>conditioned</distinct>. Conditioned means being bound by
                        marks, and the conditioned is taught for the sake of childish ordinary
                        beings who are attached to mistaken perceptions. The wise, full of
                        understanding and knowledge, do not observe them as conditioned phenomena or
                        something understood to be conditioned phenomena. They are called
                        conditioned phenomena because the wise do not categorize them. Why is this?
                        How do the wise know and understand the features of the conditioned? The
                        wise view all conditioned phenomena as being false, insubstantial, and
                        without bondage. They see that they cannot be categorized. When they
                        contemplate this, they are not attached to conditioned phenomena, and they
                        do not appropriate conditioned phenomena. Why is this? Lokadhara, it is not
                        the case that unconditioned phenomena exist separate from conditioned
                        phenomena, or that conditioned phenomena exist separate from unconditioned

                        is the unconditioned. Why is this? There is nothing conditioned within the

                        that mistaken beings can see and understand the characteristics of the

                        marks, it would not be unconditioned. It is when one teaches in terms of

                        ceasing, and not remaining or transitioning. Lokadhara, when someone knows
                        and understands conditioned and unconditioned phenomena, for that person
                        there is no arising, ceasing, or remaining and transitioning. Therefore,

                        occurring of origination. If phenomena have no origination, they do not
                        occur. If origination does not arise, it does not reverse course, and there
                        is also no remaining or transitioning. Lokadhara, this is accurately seeing
                        and understanding the reality of the conditioned. One who accurately sees
                        and understands this will not fall into the categories of arising, ceasing,
                        and remaining and transitioning. Regarding conditioned and unconditioned
                        phenomena, bodhisattvas think, ‘I do not consider conditioned phenomena to
                        be joined together with unconditioned phenomena, or unconditioned phenomena
                        to be joined together with conditioned phenomena.’ They also think, ‘The
                        true characteristic of conditioned phenomena is the unconditioned itself.’
                        In this way they go beyond thinking. Not conceptualizing in terms of
                        conditioned and unconditioned phenomena is itself unconditioned phenomenon.
                        If one conceptualizes the conditioned and unconditioned, one cannot
                        understand and know the unconditioned. If one eliminates all conceptuality,
                        one understands and knows the unconditioned to be reality. They understand
                        the characteristic of observation, they eliminate all forms of observation,
                        and they do not conceptualize in terms of categories or absence of
                        categories. Lokadhara, these are bodhisattva great beings’ means with regard
                        to conditioned and unconditioned phenomena. <ref cRef="F.70.b" type="folio"/> By not observing either

                        Ratnaprabha. He became tremendously diligent when he heard the teachings on
                        the practices of the five aggregates, the eighteen elements, the twelve

                        was two hundred thousand years, he never generated any attitude of
                        negativity. Thus, he did not give rise to attachment, aggression, or
                        ignorance, nor did he have any concern for profit, fame, food, drink,
                        clothing, or his begging bowl. Rather, he generated great diligence in order
                        to engage in the practice of this teaching. Lokadhara, the bodhisattva great
                        being Ratnaprabha observed pure conduct within the teachings of the blessed
                        Majestic Mount Meru of Gold from the Jambū River for his entire life. As he

                        After passing away young, he was once again born into that buddha realm,
                        where he practiced pure conduct. He then took birth five hundred times per

                        omniscient wisdom rapidly, must, during the final period of five hundred
                        years after I have entered parinirvāṇa, be diligent and generate a strong resolve. Then
                        they must generate great interest, great diligence, and great carefulness,

                        bodhisattvas have not only made this pledge in this one life. Ānanda, I
                        recall that these bodhisattvas have previously pledged, in countless,
                        innumerable buddha realms, to sustain the teachings of those buddhas
                        throughout the three times. Thereby, they have served the purpose of

                        all your suffering in these great hells.’ That being might then physically
                        accept, for thousands of years, all the hellish suffering of the beings that
                        had thus been freed from the great hell realms. Tell me Ānanda? Would that

                        are conditioned phenomena, and so they would not bring about disenchantment,

                        brought to beings by these bodhisattvas bring them unsurpassed happiness.
                        They make the wise develop interest in pursuing the awakening of buddhahood;
                        they perform the deeds of the buddhas; they cause the hearers and solitary
                        buddhas—who have not yet entered the genuine abode—to attain that level; and
                        they bring benefit and joy to bodhisattvas by teaching and instructing them
                        through the Dharma teachings of buddhahood. Ānanda, bodhisattvas remain in
                        the world teaching and instructing, thus bringing benefit and joy to others,
                        in order to ensure the continuity of the lineage of the Buddha, and to
                        protect and sustain the lineage of omniscient wisdom. Ānanda, when these
                        beings previously engaged in bodhisattva conduct, they ensured the

                        millions of eons. Why is this? Ānanda, when these bodhisattvas were engaged
                        in bodhisattva conduct in the past, they steered countless buddhas toward
                        the awakening of buddhahood. In all their lives, these bodhisattvas

                        and perfect awakening of millions of buddhas. They also steered countless

                        through the power of teaching and training them, they all perfected the
                        qualities of buddhahood and fully awakened to unsurpassed and perfect
