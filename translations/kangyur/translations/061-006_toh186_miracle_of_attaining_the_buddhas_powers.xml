                    First, he magically transports his entire audience and retinue to Vārāṇasī.
                    Secondly, having incited Avalokiteśvara and Vajrapāṇi to use their own
                    miraculous powers to gather there all the beings who must be led to awakening,
                    he makes the whole world appear as a pure realm like Sukhāvatī. He explains that
                    a tathāgata’s various powers are like a doctor’s skills, and teaches, with
                    Mañjuśrī’s help in a series of dialogues with other protagonists, on how the
                    tathāgatas manifest to beings, displaying his supernatural powers a third time
                    by making many other buddhas appear all around him. The meaning of the
                    Tathāgata’s miracles are gradually disclosed to the audience, as well as some
                    other essential points including the merit to be gained by honoring the
                    teachings. </p>

                        the Buddha is dwelling together with a retinue of bodhisattvas including
                        Avalokiteśvara, Vajrapāṇi, Maitreya, and Mañjuśrī, as well as great hearers
                        like Subhūti, Śāriputra, and Maudgalyāyana. After Śakra and Brahmā pay their
                        respects, the Tathāgata magically transports himself together with his
                        entire assembly to a grove in Vārāṇasī, where he manifests his supernatural
                        powers.</p>

                    <p tid="5">The Buddha, upon entering into the state of state of concentration
                        known as <distinct><!--type="concentration"-->the garlands of the
                            buddhas</distinct>, asks Avalokiteśvara and Vajrapāṇi to summon
                        miraculously all degenerate beings of the Sahā world system who must be led
                        to awakening. Entering into the same state of concentration, Avalokiteśvara
                        and Vajrapāṇi manifest light rays and inspirational verses to invite those
                        beings to the mango grove. Once they arrive, the Tathāgata displays his
                        supernatural powers by exerting his sovereign power over the whole world,
                        turning it into a place similar to the pure realm of Sukhāvatī. With
                        Mañjuśrī’s help, he teaches on how the tathāgatas manifest to beings in a
                        series of dialogues with other protagonists. He explains that a tathāgata is
                        like a doctor who knows the various diseases of beings and the methods to
                        cure them. The Buddha finally displays his supernatural powers a third time
                        by making many other buddhas appear all around him. The sūtra ends with a
                        condensed summary of Buddhadharma.</p>

                        <emph>The necessity for miracles</emph>. At the beginning of the text, it is
                        stated that sentient beings who could fall into negative forms of existence
                        should be converted to the path in order to lead them to unsurpassable
                        awakening. This can only occur, though, through the display of miracles. </p>

                    <p tid="8">
                        <emph>The description of miracles</emph>. In this sūtra, the miracles of the
                        Buddha are presented in three different ways: as magical transformations, as
                        the ability to know another’s mind, and as the capacity to destroy
                        defilements by expounding the Dharma. First the Buddha performs supernatural
                        actions that transform the immediate physical surroundings. Then he explains
                        that beings should be helped according to their dispositions, inclinations,
                        and capacities. Since the Tathāgata is able to know beings’ minds through
                        his supernatural powers, he is able to assist them through various skillful
                        means (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">upāya</foreign>, <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">thabs</foreign>) corresponding to their
                        circumstances. Vasubandhu explains this sequence in great detail in the
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhidharmakośa</title>: the Buddha first
                        ravishes the minds of beings he wishes to set on the path through the
                        display of his extraordinary powers. Knowing their dispositions,
                        inclinations, and capacities, he then imparts methods that will ultimately
                        lead them to unsurpassable, truly perfect awakening. The use of such
                        miracles by the Buddha as skillful means is a recurring theme of Mahāyāna
                        sūtras, as can be seen, for example, in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Śūraṃgama­samādhi­sūtra</title> (Lamotte 2003: 233) where there is a
                        passage that mirrors the storyline of the present sūtra.</p>

                        <emph>The “magical show” as an analogy for the nature of reality</emph>. The
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Buddha­balā­dhāna­prātihārya­vikurvāṇa­nirdeśa</title> makes the
                        important point that conditioned phenomena are like a “show” or an illusion,
                        as clearly explained by Mañjuśrī to the gods. Just like a reflection in a
                        mirror, the Tathāgata neither comes nor goes. Things neither arise nor
                        cease. Yet the Tathāgata appears in the world for the sake of beings. For
                        him, however, there is no birth, no old age, and no death. The sūtra
                        explains that since all conditioned phenomena are like illusions, the
                        extraordinary activities of a tathāgata, such as teaching and leading beings
                        to awakening, are not limited by time and space. His teaching remains even
                        if he manifested the extinction of suffering eons ago. As an object of
                        veneration, he is a means to reach awakening by accumulating merit. His
                        purpose and meaning are not constrained by notions of his being present or
                        absent. The same idea occurs in a sūtra found in the Ratnakūṭa, <title xml:lang="en">The Prophecy for the Magician Bhadra</title> (Toh.
                        65)<!--Reference Toh 0065-->, in which the Tathāgata displays similar
                        miracles (Chang 1983: 4–13) and in which it is stated that the Buddha can
                        perform magic because he knows that all phenomena are illusory. Action
                            (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">karma</foreign>) is explained as
                        being the great conjurer that magically creates beings and material objects.
                        Thus, the basis of the Tathāgata’s supernatural powers is considered to be
                        his realization that all phenomena are like magic and illusions. </p>

                        explains that there is no birth, old age, and death. However, one’s state of
                        life is dependent on the perception conditioned by the body, since beings
                        are fixated on the physical basis of their existence. These perceptions
                        trigger actions. On the basis of these actions, beings will experience
                        suffering again and again throughout all their future rebirths. This endless
                        cycle of arisings and cessations is what is called <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">saṃsāra</foreign>. The scales of a balance are used as

                        with no major variations. A glimpse of what might have been the source text
                        for the Tibetan translation of the sūtra is afforded by some Sanskrit
                        fragments in the collection of Gilgit manuscripts. The Gilgit manuscripts
                        are among the oldest manuscripts in the world, dating back to the 5th and
                        6th centuries A.D., and include famous works from the Buddhist canon such as
                        the <title xml:lang="en">Lotus Sūtra</title>. The language of these
                        manuscripts is a form of Sanskrit with Prakrit vocabulary and inflections.

                    <p tid="18">Another good illustration of the difficulty of translating compounds
                        is the title of the sūtra itself, <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Buddha­balādhāna­prātihārya­vikurvāṇa</title>, which Schopen does not
                        translate in his study of the Sanskrit text. Although the Sanskrit term
                            <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">balādhāna</foreign> is translated
                        in the Mahāvyutpatti as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">stobs skyed
                            pa</foreign>, different transliterations are found in the various
                        Kangyur editions. For example, the Degé Kangyur reads <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">balavadhana</foreign>, the Stok Palace
                        reads <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">balādhana</foreign>, the
                        Narthang reads <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">baladhana</foreign>,
                        and so forth. The Pedurma (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe sdur ma</title>,
                        comparative edition, see <ptr target="#bibliography">bibliography</ptr>)
                        settles for <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">balavardhana</foreign>.
                        In the present case, we chose to follow Schopen, who opts for <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">balādhāna</foreign> (1978: 319). Edgerton,
                        in his <title xml:lang="en">Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Grammar and
                            Dictionary</title>, offers a detailed explanation of this term, which he
                        understands as “the attainment of (usually some particular) <term type="ignore">power</term>,” such as the <term type="ignore">powers</term> of a tathāgata (1953: 398a). As for the rest of the
                        compound, we have translated <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prātihārya</foreign> as “miracle” and <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vikurvāṇa</foreign> as “extraordinary transformation.”
                        In the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Śūraṃgama­samādhi­sūtra</title> (Lamotte
                        2003: 233), <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prātihāryabala</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vikurvāṇabala</foreign> are often used as
                        synonyms. Lamotte reads them as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">karmadhāraya</foreign> compounds (in the way of adjective+noun)
                        respectively meaning “wondrous <term type="ignore">powers</term>” and
                        “prodigious <term type="ignore">powers</term>.” Burnouf, on his part,
                        understands <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ṛddhi­prātihārya</foreign> as “supernatural transformation” (2010:
                        189). La Vallée Poussin translates <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prātihārya</foreign> as “magical <term type="ignore">powers</term>” in
                        v. VII.47–48 of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhidharmakośa</title> (and

                        In this context, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prātihārya</foreign>
                        is used by a buddha to convert beings through the manifestation of
                        miraculous powers, the ability to know others’ minds, and the capacity to
                        teach, all of which correspond very much to the subject matter of our sūtra.
                        In this context, the third <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prātihārya</foreign> is deemed to be superior since it cannot be
                        attained by means of magic formulae (La Vallée Poussin 1988–90: 1166–68 and
                        1209–1210). For these reasons, we have not read <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prāti­hārya­vikurvāṇa</foreign> as a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dvandva</foreign> in this context, as we
                        were originally tempted to do. It is probably a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">karmadhāraya</foreign> (noun+noun) and possibly a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tatpuruṣa</foreign>. In the Tibetan
                            <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">cho ’phrul rnam par ’phrul
                            pa</foreign>, the two terms stand in apposition, indicating rather a
                            <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">karmadhāraya</foreign>. The
                        complete title of the sūtra can therefore be translated as “The Teaching on
                        the Extraordinary Transformation that is the Miracle of Attaining the
                        Buddha’s Powers,” and indeed the message of the sūtra is that the ultimate
                        miracle is to attain the state of buddhahood. Supernatural powers are only a
                        means to lead beings to awakening. </p>

                    <p tid="19">Another translation issue concerns the mention in the sūtra of a
                        grove (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">shing a mra srung ba’i tshal
                            / a mra srung ba mo’i tshal</foreign>) located in Vāraṇasī. Although
                        there is no extant Sanskrit fragment for this passage, Schopen translated
                        the phrase <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">a mra srung ba mo’i
                            tshal</foreign> from the Tibetan as “the grove of Āmrapālī” (see Schopen
                        1978: 323 fragment [1288]), taking it as a reference to the grove offered to
                        the Buddha by the courtesan Āmrapāli in which several events and teachings
                        recorded in the canonical texts took place. This translation is problematic
                        here, however, because Āmrapālī’s grove was located in Vaiśālī and not
                        Vāraṇasī. There are several reasons for thinking that these phrases do not
                        refer to Āmrapālī’s grove. In the narratives of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinaya</title> texts—the only instances in the Kangyur in which
                        Āmrapālī is a protagonist in her own right as opposed to mentions of her
                        grove—her name is rendered in Tibetan as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">a mra skyong ma</foreign>, while the phrase a <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mra srung ba</foreign>, which is often
                        taken as an alternative rendering, is in fact only used in the sūtra section
                        of the Kangyur, and only within the phrase a <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mra srung ba’i tshal</foreign>, i.e. referring to a grove.
                        There are, it is true, several sūtras explicitly located in Vaiśālī in which
                            <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">a mra srung ba’i tshal</foreign>
                        can be reasonably taken as referring to Āmrapālī’s grove. In this text,
                        however, we are faced not only with the anomalous location, but also with
                        the variant phrases <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">shing a mra srung
                            ba’i tshal</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">a mra
                            srung ba mo’i tshal</foreign>, both of which occur only here and nowhere
                        else in the entire Kangyur. A literal translation of the syntactic
                        construction in this text, <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">shing a
                            mra srung ba’i tshal</foreign> (F.143.b) would be “grove of the
                        caretaker of mango trees,” and our understanding is that the term <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">a mra srung ba</foreign> (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">āmrapāla</foreign> / <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">āmrapālī</foreign>) is simply a generic name with this
                        meaning, not a proper noun. In a word, the translation of <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">a mra srung ba’i tshal</foreign> as
                        “Āmrapālī’s grove” is technically wrong, although it is semantically correct
                        when the grove is located in Vaiśālī. Other possible hypotheses to explain
                        the anomaly would be that at some point in the transmission of the text a
                        geographical or nominal inaccuracy has been introduced; or else that the
                        translocation of Āmrapālī’s grove to Vāraṇasī is intended to be understood
                        as part of the Buddha’s miraculous display. </p>

                        were thinking and said to them, “Gods, do not think like that, do not say
                        such things. Do not be depressed. Many are the skillful means of the
                        tathāgatas. They teach the Dharma to beings of diverse inclinations by means
                        of their sovereign power, and the power of their roots of virtue, which
                        consists of various methods, insights, and states of concentration. Gods,
                        since I have seen the supernatural powers and miracles of extraordinary

                        know. So surely the Tathāgata will indeed wish to expound and spread the

                        parinirvāṇa, because there is no parinirvāṇa of the tathāgatas, nor are
                        their lives ever exhausted. The tathāgatas remain for immeasurable millions
                        of eons, for utterly inexpressible eons. But through their skillful means
                        they display their parinirvāṇa to beings, as well as the disappearance of
                        the noble Dharma. Just as the Tathāgata sees the various beings of an impure
                        nature who are to be converted by means of parinirvāṇa or by relics, who
                        have no faith in the Tathāgata, and who are irreverent toward the master, so
                        in each such case the Tathāgata displays his parinirvāṇa. But in fact, the
                        Tathāgata neither comes nor goes. When the roots of virtue of beings have
                        fully matured, <ref cRef="F.149.a" type="folio"/> and they long to look upon the

                            Kangyurs we consulted are not helpful here. Schopen suggests reading the
                            long Sanskrit compound °<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">saddharmedharaṇa­pūjanā</foreign> (1978: 332 §1296) as a dative:
                                °<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pūjanān nānā-</foreign>.
                            This emendation is justified by the fact that the loss of a final dental
                            followed by the same consonant is frequent in the Gilgit manuscripts
                            (1978: 336, n9). We have chosen to follow Schopen’s suggestion. However,
                            it should be added that another problem is involved with Schopen’s
                            reading: the verb <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">mokṣayanti</foreign> has no object in the emended Sanskrit
                            sentence. Schopen therefore also has to add the logical object satvān to
                            the sentence on top of his emendation of the compound °<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">saddharmedharaṇa­pūjanā</foreign>. An
                            alternative reading based on the principle of lectio difficilior would
                            be to accept Schopen’s emendation °<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">saddharmedharaṇa­pūjanān</foreign> but to read it as a
                            bahuvrīhi (accusative plural) instead of a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tatpuruṣa</foreign> (dative singular). The preceding
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">satvānām</foreign> could be
                            read in this case as a partitive genitive: “those who have veneration,
                            etc. (i.e., °<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pūjanān</foreign> =
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bahuvrīhi</foreign> acc.
                            plu.) among sentient beings (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">satvānām</foreign> = partitive genitive).” The complete sentence
                            would read: “Moreover, gods, although a thousand years, an eon, or ten
                            million eons may have elapsed since the tathāgatas attained parinirvāṇa,
                            on account of their former vows, they liberate from all the hells,
                            animal births, the world of Yama, downfalls into inopportune existences,
                            unfortunate destinies, and bad rebirths those who among beings worship

                        need is there to mention those who worship the tathāgatas in person by
                        offering them flowers, incense, perfume, garlands, salves, clothes, and
                        aromatic powders? Gods, even though one thousand years, an eon, or even ten
                        million eons may have elapsed since the Bhagavān Buddha entered parinirvāṇa,
                        if some beings throw a flower in the sky, after calling the Tathāgata by his
                        name seven times and saying ‘Homage to the Buddha,’ they will all bring an
                        end to their suffering. But, let alone throwing a flower in the sky, if
                        someone, whoever they might be, faithfully emulating the Tathāgata, strives
                        to maintain even a single precept in order to honor the Tathāgata, or
                        strives to focus on worshipping the Tathāgata even for a single day, or a
                        single night, or a single moment, this person will put an end to suffering
                        and gradually, fully, and completely awaken to unsurpassable, truly perfect
                        enlightenment. If even those who, in order to honor the Tathāgata, laugh,
                        have fun, joke like fools, play games, or make a stūpa from sand will all
                        put an end to suffering and fully and completely awaken to unsurpassable,
                        truly perfect enlightenment, what need is there to mention those who have
                        built relic stūpas or relic images and, understanding that compassion toward
                        all beings is the most important thing, think, ‘I shall liberate all beings
                        from suffering’? And what need is there to mention those who, having
                        produced the thought directed toward unsurpassable, truly perfect awakening,
                            <ref cRef="F.150.a" type="folio"/> make offerings of divine flowers and incense,
                        garlands, salves, aromatic powders, cymbals, umbrellas, and royal banners?
                        Those who have thus made offerings to all the tathāgatas will be free from
                        birth, old age, sickness, and death, as well as from misery, lamentation,
                        suffering, unhappiness, and afflictions. And as long as they have not
                        completely and fully awakened to unsurpassable, truly perfect awakening,
                        they will be reborn in pleasant forms of existence. Gods, thus can one
                        discern the aspiration of the tathāgatas of the past and be in perfect
