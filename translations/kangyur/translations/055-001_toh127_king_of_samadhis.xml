                <p tid="1">This sūtra, much quoted in later Buddhist writings for its profound
                    statements especially on the nature of emptiness, relates a long teaching given
                    by the Buddha mainly in response to questions put by a young layman,
                    Candraprabha. The samādhi that is the subject of the sūtra, in spite of its
                    name, primarily consists of various aspects of conduct, motivation, and the
                    understanding of emptiness; it is also a way of referring to the sūtra itself.
                    The teaching given in the sūtra is the instruction to be dedicated to the
                    possession and promulgation of the samādhi, and to the necessary conduct of a
                    bodhisattva, which is exemplified by a number of accounts from the Buddha’s
                    previous lives. Most of the teaching takes place on Vulture Peak Mountain, with
                    an interlude recounting the Buddha’s invitation and visit to Candraprabha’s home
                    in Rājagṛha, where he continues to teach Candraprabha before returning to
                    Vulture Peak Mountain. In one subsequent chapter the Buddha responds to a
                    request by Ānanda, and the text concludes with a commitment by Ānanda to
                    maintain this teaching in the future. </p>

                        and prophecies for the future. Its teaching on emptiness is much quoted by
                        such Mādhyamaka masters as Candrakīrti and Śāntideva, as well as in later

                        meditation, motivation, and realization. The sūtra enumerates over three
                        hundred of the samādhi’s qualities. One of the samādhi’s main descriptive
                        epithets is given in the long form of the title itself as “the revealed<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-055-001-5" index="1"> According to the BHS

                        However, far from being a systematic textbook on the features of any one
                        practice or doctrine, the sūtra has a complex, convoluted structure and
                        includes long narrative passages. These not only relate the Buddha’s
                        interactions with Candraprabha, the main interlocutor, but also tell lengthy
                        stories in mixed prose and verse from the Buddha’s past lives—in his own
                        words—exemplifying the points he teaches. Interspersed in these narratives,
                        often in the form of verse teachings given by past tathāgatas, are some of
                        the profound statements on the nature of phenomena, and on the essential
                        points of the path, for which the sūtra is justly celebrated. </p>

                        work first appeared in writing; indeed, the sūtra is very likely a
                        compilation of earlier shorter works. None of the complete extant Sanskrit
                        manuscripts can be dated to earlier than the sixth century. There is,
                        however, a reference to it in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sūtrasamuccaya</title>, a work attributed to Nāgārjuna (second or third
                        century) although the attribution is not universally accepted. There is even
                        a claim that the <title xml:lang="en">King of Samādhis Sūtra</title> was
                        translated into Chinese in 148 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, but this, too,
                        is disputed. The mention of a <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Samādhirāja</title>

                        Narendrayaśas (517–589) was a much-traveled Indian monk from Orissa who
                        arrived in China in 556. This Chinese version is widely known under an
                        alternative title, <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Candra­pradīpa­samādhi­sūtra</title> (<title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra of
                            the Samādhi of the Lamp of the Moon</title>, Taishō 639); this title is
                        closely related to the alternative title used in some Indian commentaries
                        (see below). Narendrayaśas’s translation is divided into ten chapters, in
                        contrast to the forty of the Tibetan. There are fragments of three Sanskrit
                        manuscripts from central Asia, dated to the fifth or sixth centuries, that
                        correspond to this version, but no complete manuscript has survived. </p>

                            many other activities, he studied and collected Sanskrit Buddhist texts.
                            Haraprasad Shastri (1853–1931) was an Indian Sanskrit scholar and

                            represents the Hodgson and Shastri manuscripts, which Dutt refers to,

                        appears to be classical Sanskrit in terms of spelling and case endings, but
                        the vocabulary includes words that are only found in BHS, or words that

                        been claimed that it represents a sūtra version of Gampopa’s Mahāmudrā
                        teaching—but not explicitly so, and indeed the reader will not find any such
                        doctrinal elements that set its viewpoint particularly apart from that of
                        the <title xml:lang="en">Perfection of Wisdom</title> sūtras.</p>

                    <p tid="24">The sūtra portrays a form of Buddhism that emphasized mendicancy,
                        living at the foot of trees in forests, and so on, in opposition to less
                        austere Buddhist ways of life. It considers nirvāṇa impossible to attain for
                        householders, and likens nirvāṇa to a flame being extinguished, bringing any
                        activity to an end. In it, the Buddha emphasizes again and again the vast
                        number of eons during which he and other tathāgatas practiced before
                        attaining enlightenment.</p>

                    <p tid="25">It contains prophecies describing the very time when the sūtra
                        itself is being disseminated in India, saying it will be rejected and
                        denounced by other monks. As well as its strong promotion of mendicancy,
                        insisting that a bhikṣu should remain in the forest and have no possessions,
                        it condemns the corruption of bhikṣus who accumulate possessions and visit
                        laypeople’s homes to teach them there. Its strict adherence to the forest
                        lifestyle, and its condemnation of bhikṣus who do not follow it, would not
                        have found wide favor in some of the Buddhist establishments of that time.
                        The sūtra also addresses the known problem of that time of destitute people
                        who joined the ranks of Buddhist monks in order to receive material support
                        for themselves, without having any genuine dedication to or understanding of
                        the teaching.</p>

                    <p tid="26">This is one example of how the sūtra shows evidence of the
                        conditions prevailing at the time and place it was promulgated. Another—one
                        of its less appealing aspects for our present age, but one that is typical
                        of many early Mahāyāna sūtras—is its attitude toward women: the bodhisattva
                        is always male, as is explicit in the Sanskrit (although in this translation
                        frequent use has been made of the plural to render bodhisattvas’ male gender
                        less obvious). Women often appear as property that is given away, and the
                        noble kings have harems as well as slaves, though the Tibetan did not have
                        the term to translate <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">antapuraḥ</foreign> (harem) and used the more palatable “retinue of
                        queens.” However, women are still seen as capable of being devotees of the
                        path of the sūtra, and in particular there is the tale of Princess
                        Jñānāvatī, who cuts off the flesh from her thigh so as to heal her sick
                        bhikṣu teacher. But in every such case this means that the woman will gain a
                        male rebirth so that she may be able to continue on the path to
                        enlightenment.</p>

                    <p tid="27">The sūtra also mentions the sacrificial offering of burning a hand
                        (which is, however, then miraculously reconstituted). This passage, along
                        with similar accounts in other sūtras, has inspired the Tibetan tradition of
                        burning a finger as an offering.</p>

                    <p tid="28">The sūtra has several references linking it with South India. It
                        contains references to South Indian music, and the nominative -<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">u</foreign> ending is a characteristic of South India.
                        More significantly, in the post-Gilgit additional verses there is a special
                        emphasis given to Rishi Ananta, who was highly revered in the south.</p>

                        appeared. This being an early Mahāyāna sūtra, there is no mention in the

                        nirmāṇakāya, but only dharmakāya and rūpakāya; the doctrine of three kāyas
                        came to prominence later. Nor is there any real mention of the
                        tathāgatagarbha, or buddha nature, another notion developed in later
                        works.</p>

                    <p tid="30">Although there is mention in both the Gilgit and Chinese versions of
                        Buddha Amitābha and his realm Sukhāvatī, Amitābha’s accompanying
                        bodhisattvas Avalokiteśvara and Mahāstāmaprapta are noticeable by their
                        absence, indicating that the sūtra dates back to a time before their rise to
                        prominence, and possibly to a time even before the appearance of the longer
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sukhāvatīsūtra</title>. However, as might be
                        expected, both bodhisattvas do appear in the additional verses of the later
                        Sanskrit versions, and therefore the Tibetan, too. As a pair, however, they
                        still have equal status, as they frequently do in Mahāyāna sūtras before the
                        rise of Avalokiteśvara to preeminence by the fourth or fifth century. </p>

                        version, as the Perfection of Wisdom tradition, as well as the early

                    <p tid="32">A particular feature that the sūtra shares with quite a large number
                        of other Mahāyāna sūtras, such as the <title xml:lang="en">White Lotus of

                        focus of a bodhisattva’s practice, stating that the bodhisattva should
                        recite it, promulgate it, and so on. </p>

                    <p tid="33">Given the significant differences between the versions of this sūtra
                        in Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan, an English translation could never
                        represent all versions equally, and necessarily involves a selective
                        approach based on stated principles. In this translation of the <title xml:lang="en">King of Samādhis</title>, we have chosen to stay as close
                        as possible to the Tibetan of the Kangyur, which has more content than both
                        the Chinese translation and the Gilgit manuscript. However, we have compared
                        the Tibetan closely to the Chinese and Gilgit versions, along with the two
                        longer Nepalese Sanskrit manuscripts identified in this translation as
                        Shastri and Hodgson (see above). Discrepancies between the versions are
                        recorded in the notes. </p>

                    <p tid="34">Where there are significant discrepancies, the Tibetan has been
                        favored in the translation wherever possible, as it probably represents a
                        particular Sanskrit version that has not survived. In some instances,
                        however, adhering to the Tibetan would have caused problems regarding the
                        meaning of the text, and here the Sanskrit reading has been preferred.
                        Consulting the other versions has also been indispensable in clearing up
                        ambiguities, variations in the Tibetan between the different Kangyurs, and
                        the occasional error in the Tibetan, the results of scribal corruption or
                        adopting the wrong meaning of a word, such as the classical Sanskrit meaning
                        instead of the BHS meaning. Also of great help has been clarification from
                        the Chinese translation that Ling-Lung Chen has been able to provide. In one
                        case, the Chinese preserves an uncorrupted version of a passage in which
                        “nature” was later replaced by “past,” resulting in a peculiar set of verses
                        with a peculiar meaning.</p>

                                his subjects make extensive offerings to him. However, the king
                                realizes that his subjects have made the offerings with the hope for
                                material benefits in future lives. Buddha Ghoṣadatta recites verses
                                on how it is necessary to abandon one’s home and all material
                                possessions. King Mahābala becomes a bhikṣu, and in subsequent
                                lifetimes serves two hundred million buddhas and hears the teaching
                                of this sūtra from them all. He eventually becomes a buddha named
                                Jñānaśūra. Mahābala’s subjects, who also became bhikṣus, all become
                                buddhas named Dṛḍhaśūra.</p>

                            <p tid="44">The Buddha tells Candraprabha that a bodhisattva needs to
                                attain three kinds of patience. The first patience is to maintain
                                the Dharma by not arguing, and so on; to know that everything is an
                                illusion; to know the sūtras; to have no doubt; to have no anger
                                toward tīrthikas; to speak truthfully; never to abandon the path to
                                buddhahood; and to master worldly skills. The second patience is
                                having undisturbed śamatha and vipaśyanā, being in meditation during
                                all activity, attaining the five higher cognitions, having
                                miraculous powers, and remembering every word that is taught. With
                                the third patience the bodhisattva can see all other worlds, has a
                                golden body, teaches millions of beings, receives the prophecy of
                                his buddhahood, and being aware of emptiness he remains unaffected
                                by praise or blame, loss or gain.</p>

                            <p tid="45">The Buddha tells Candraprabha that the bodhisattva has to
                                attain the wisdom of the nonexistence of phenomena so that he will
                                have no desire. He adds that in the past there was a buddha named
                                Abhāva­samudgata, who at birth levitated and declared the
                                nonexistence of all phenomena, following which all the sounds in the
                                world made the same declaration. Later, a prince named
                                Mahā­karuṇā­cintin became one of his bhikṣus, received the teaching
                                of this sūtra, and thereby after twenty eons became a buddha named
                                Suvicintitārtha.</p>

                                attained buddhahood as a result of practicing the teaching of this
                                sūtra. He says that the patience of the Dharma is attained through
                                realizing that everything is like a dream or an illusion, so that
                                there is no desire, anger, or ignorance. He teaches that one should
                                avoid association with fools, and with those who have become bhikṣus
                                as a source of livelihood. He teaches that one should not only give
                                the teachings but also practice and realize them.</p>

                                Buddha places his hand on Candraprabha’s head and Candraprabha
                                instantly realizes quintillions of samādhis. Candraprabha praises
                                the Buddha and invites him to come for his midday meal at his home.
                                The Buddha assents by remaining silent. Candraprabha then has the
                                road to his home cleaned and divinely adorned. Throughout the night,
                                he prepares a sumptuous meal. He then adorns the city and his own
                                home. Accompanied by bodhisattvas and citizens he goes to Vulture
                                Peak Mountain to invite the Buddha to his home. The Buddha proceeds
                                there accompanied by a multitude of deities. The ground shakes as he
                                takes his first step into the city. Everyone in the world becomes
                                happy and deities make vast offerings.</p>

                                home. When the Buddha has finished eating, Candraprabha praises him,
                                aspires to become a buddha, and requests teaching that will enable
                                him to accomplish that. The Buddha states that only one quality is
                                necessary, which is the knowledge of the insubstantial nature of
                                phenomena. He also describes the vast merit and good results that
                                come from knowing even one verse of this sūtra. Candraprabha aspires
                                to be a keeper of this sūtra in the future. The Buddha prophesies to
                                many millions of beings who are present that they will attain
                                buddhahood after more than four million eons have passed.</p>

                                Then the Buddha prophesies that in the future there will be bhikṣus

                                Vulture Peak Mountain in order to prepare offerings to the Buddha.
                                When he arrives there he transforms it into a flat, divinely adorned
                                ground with a throne in its center. Then he returns to
                                Candraprabha’s home and describes what he has created. The Buddha
                                returns to the mountain and sits on the throne. Candraprabha and
                                millions of others also come to the mountain and Candraprabha
                                requests a teaching. The Buddha describes four qualities necessary
                                for attaining the samādhi of this sūtra: the first is calmness and
                                self-restraint, the second is correct conduct, the third is fear of
                                the three realms, and the fourth is devotion to the Dharma and
                                benefiting others. Then in verse the Buddha describes a succession
                                of buddhas within two eons of the distant past. He states that
                                whoever hears their names will quickly attain this samādhi. Then he
                                recounts that they were followed by a buddha named Narendraghoṣa. At
                                that time the Buddha was a king named Śirībala, who with five
                                hundred sons received this samādhi teaching from Narendraghoṣa. He
                                and his sons all became bhikṣus. Śirībala was then reborn as the son
                                of King Dṛḍhabala. The prince, remembering millions of previous
                                lives, asks if the Buddha Narendraghoṣa is still alive, and
                                describes and praises his teaching of this samādhi. King Dṛḍhabala
                                brings his son, along with millions of other people, to that buddha,
                                hears the teaching, and becomes a bhikṣu. Sixty eons later King
                                Dṛḍhabala becomes Buddha Padmottara, and all his subjects who became
                                bhikṣus all eventually become buddhas who all have the same name:
                                Ananta­jñānanottara. The five hundred sons became the five hundred
                                students of Śākyamuni who would in future times teach this sūtra.
                                King Dṛḍhabala and his queen also became the Buddha’s parents:

                                samādhi in the future. The Buddha says that only bhikṣus with pure
                                mendicancy will have faith in it. Those who reject it will have
                                incalculable bad karma. Candraprabha vows to promulgate the sūtra in
                                a future life and endure the abuse of those with no faith in it.
                                Eight hundred others also vow to uphold the sūtra and eight hundred
                                million deities vow to protect them. The Buddha gives his blessing,
                                the world shakes, and the Buddha prophesies the buddhahood of the
                                millions of beings who have listened to the sūtra.</p>

                            <p tid="56">The Buddha teaches Candraprabha that it is through this
                                samādhi that the inconceivable Dharma is attained. Candraprabha,
                                listening to the teaching, attains that samādhi. A thousand million
                                worlds shake as a result. A multitude of devas rejoice that they
                                have also heard this teaching. The gandharva Pañcaśikha with five
                                hundred other gandharvas fly down to Vulture Peak Mountain and play
                                music as an offering. The Buddha causes the teaching of the
                                inconceivable Dharma to come from the sound of their music. The
                                teaching describes the unreality of existence and the benefits of
                                nonattachment and equanimity. </p>

                                on accumulating merit and avoiding the influence of bad companions.
                                The verses describe how in the distant past, a king came across two
                                renunciants in the forest and was inspired by them. However, bhikṣus
                                who disliked their ascetic lifestyle and views urged the king to
                                kill or banish them. A goddess who looked after the king’s benefit
                                countered their influence. They succeeded in influencing the king’s
                                brother and he led an army to the forest. The deities of the forest
                                massacred them and all involved in the plot were reborn in hell. The
                                Buddha explains that the two monks were Buddha Dīpaṃkara and
                                himself, the king was Maitreya, and Candraprabha was the
                                goddess.</p>

                                Candraprabha not to have attachment to body or life. Those who avoid
                                such attachment will attain buddhahood. Those who do have these
                                attachments will commit bad actions and go to hell after death.</p>

                                identified as his rūpakāya or form body, but as the dharmakāya, the
                                “Dharma body,” which is indescribable and unquantifiable. Even
                                though someone sees the physical presence of a buddha, that is a
                                manifestation of the dharmakāya, and it is the dharmakāya that is
                                the Buddha’s true body, which cannot be perceived as having any
                                features or actions. </p>

                            <p tid="61">The Buddha teaches Candraprabha that through this sūtra a
                                bodhisattva can gain four kinds of discernment: discernment of
                                phenomena, of meaning, of definitions, and of confident speech. He
                                then gives a long explanation of the discernment of phenomena, in
                                which successive qualities are explained in relation to four
                                aspects: the composite teaching, the composite, the kleśas, and
                                purification. For each of these there is an inconceivable number of
                                each quality. The second, third, and fourth discernments are
                                explained in single brief sentences. The concluding verses state
                                that the Buddha has innumerable qualities, and exhort the teaching
                                of this sūtra.</p>

                            <p tid="62">The Buddha teaches Candraprabha in greater depth on the
                                discernment of phenomena, emphasizing that there is no difference
                                between the nature of phenomena and enlightenment, and specifying
                                that there is no difference between the nature of the skandhas and
                                enlightenment. Then in verse he teaches the emptiness of phenomena
                                and nirvāṇa, and that his true body is not his “form body,” the
                                rūpakāya, but his dharmakāya, and therefore the only one who has
                                truly seen a buddha is one who has seen the dharmakāya, who has seen
                                emptiness. There follows a condemnation of bhikṣus of the future who
                                will be concerned with gain and honors, and will teach and become
                                involved with laypeople, and are destined for the hells. However,
                                there should be no anger toward them; they should be treated with
                                respect. There is also advice on humility and circumspection in
                                giving teachings, as to who should be taught and what kind of
                                teaching should be given. There is also an exhortation to make
                                offerings, but also that the merit gained from this sūtra is far
                                more vast than the most extensive offerings.</p>

                                good actions and the benefits of mendicancy, and concludes by saying
                                that being careful is the root of all of these.</p>

                                four perfections: patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom. They
                                are followed by the benefits of becoming very learned in the Dharma,
                                giving the Dharma to others, maintaining the knowledge of emptiness,
                                maintaining detachment in meditation, remaining in solitude, and
                                following a mendicant lifestyle and begging for alms. The Buddha

                                will attain the treasure of wisdom because he remembers the teaching
                                and knows how to give it to others. Finally, he will attain the

                            <label>Chapter 33: The Benefits of Possessing the Sūtra</label>
                            <p tid="70">The Buddha teaches that dedication to this sūtra will bring
                                the higher cognitions of all phenomena. This is then explained
                                through almost three hundred verses in the Tibetan version. He
                                teaches that the higher cognitions are gained by having no
                                attachment, either to samādhi or worldly things, and by having no
                                pride. The higher cognitions are the realization that there is no
                                substance to anything, even the Buddha’s words. This realization of
                                emptiness brings buddhahood, which does not exist on the <term type="ignore">level</term> of words. Buddhahood has no form; it
                                is the dharmakāya. It transcends every kind of conceptual
                                identification. Those without this understanding believe they have
                                made spiritual progress but still have desire, particularly for
                                women. </p>
                            <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-001-77"/>
                            <p tid="71">Those who have the realization manifest pure realms. While
                                communicating with words, they transcend thought and concepts, have
                                miraculous powers, and do not age. Ordinary humans who delight in
                                this sūtra will proceed to enlightenment and will meet Buddha
                                Maitreya. Maintaining this sūtra in the degenerate age is the
                                greatest offering to the buddhas. Women who have faith in a single
                                verse from it will never be reborn as women. The bodhisattvas who
                                realize this samādhi will have inconceivable qualities and attain
                                buddhahood at Bodhgaya. </p>

                            <p tid="72">Other bodhisattvas will come to hear them teaching and those
                                bodhisattvas will adorn the world, transforming it into a pure
                                realm. Lotuses and birds throughout countless realms will emit the
                                words of the Dharma. The bodhisattva who practices this sūtra has
                                immaculate conduct and at death will go to Sukhāvatī, and in the
                                degenerate age will be the protector of the Dharma.</p>

                            <label>Chapter 34: Kṣemadatta</label>
                            <p tid="73">The Buddha teaches that the bodhisattva who wishes to attain
                                this sūtra’s samādhi and enlightenment should make extensive
                                offerings to a living buddha or to a stūpa containing his relics,
                                and relates a story as an example. The story is about a king named
                                Śrīghoṣa who made extensive offerings to millions of stūpas
                                containing the relics of Buddha Ghoṣadatta—presumably the same
                                buddha who appears in chapter 5. One night he offers millions of
                                lamps to the stūpas. On seeing this, a young bodhisattva named
                                Kṣemadatta makes a lamp out of his hand by wrapping it in cloth and
                                dousing it in sesame oil. The light from this lamp eclipses all the
                                other light offerings, and the hand is burned away. The king and his
                                queens leap from their high palace roof to go and see this, but are
                                not hurt thanks to intervention by deities. The king approaches
                                Kṣemadatta, admires him, and expresses sorrow for the loss of his
                                hand. Kṣemadatta recites a verse on emptiness, and because of the
                                truth of his words, his hand grows back and there are other
                                miracles. The Buddha then states that he was Kṣemadatta and that
                                Maitreya was King Śrīghoṣa.</p>

                            <p tid="74">The Buddha instructs Candraprabha on four kinds of
                                dedication of merit from acts of generosity. He then states that a
                                bodhisattva should give even his own flesh to heal a teacher of the
                                Dharma from illness. He then tells the story of how, eons ago,
                                Princess Jñānāvatī followed the instructions given to her in a
                                dream, which were to use her own flesh and blood to treat her sick
                                Dharma teacher. He was miraculously cured, and she was miraculously
                                unharmed, despite having cut off her own flesh. The Buddha states
                                that he was that princess in a previous lifetime, her father the
                                king was Maitreya, and the Dharma teacher became Buddha
                                Dīpaṃkara.</p>

                            <label>Chapter 36: Supuṣpacandra</label>
                            <p tid="75">In this chapter, one of the longest in the sūtra, there is
                                no mention of Candraprabha. Instead, Ānanda requests teaching from
                                the Buddha, and the Buddha states that a bodhisattva must have
                                equanimity and not cease in his progress to enlightenment, no matter
                                what suffering he endures. The Buddha gives the example of
                                Supuṣpacandra. In an eon long ago, Buddha
                                Ratna­padma­candra­viśuddhābhyud­gata­rāja attained enlightenment,
                                liberated countless beings, and passed into nirvāṇa all in one day.
                                During the last five hundred years of his teaching, all bodhisattvas
                                had been exiled to Samantabhadra Forest. Supuṣpacandra was with them
                                as their teacher, but saw that the time had come to teach other
                                beings, even if it cost him his life. In the story, he leaves alone
                                and eventually reaches the capital, where, in the course of a week,
                                he establishes countless beings on the path to enlightenment,
                                including King Śūradatta’s harem of eighty thousand queens, and all
                                his thousand sons. On the seventh day, when the king is in a large
                                procession heading to a park, he witnesses the devotion of the
                                populace, and his own family, to a bhikṣu who is standing by the
                                road. Consumed with jealousy, he orders his executioner to slay the
                                bhikṣu. The executioner cuts him up into eight pieces. When the king
                                is returning to his capital after a week he sees that the body parts
                                have not decayed. Also the townspeople and the bodhisattvas of the
                                forest have come and discovered the death. Filled with remorse, the
                                king arranges a cremation and the building of a stūpa for the
                                relics, and for thousands of years makes offerings, confesses his
                                crime, and keeps perfect discipline. Nevertheless, he is reborn in
                                hell and for millions of eons experiences various mutilations and
                                sufferings as a result of his action. The Buddha then states that
                                King Śūradatta was one of his own previous lives, and Supuṣpacandra
                                subsequently became Buddha Padmottara.</p>

                                possessing and reciting this sūtra, even one verse of it, has
                                greater merit than eons of generosity, and that it contains an
                                incalculable number of teachings. Then the qualities are described
                                of the bhikṣu bodhisattva who has this sūtra, concluding by saying
                                that many eons would not suffice to describe them all.</p>

                            <p tid="77">The Buddha says to Candraprabha that a bodhisattva should
                                dedicate himself to ending the kleśas, gaining merit, and generating
                                roots of goodness out of an aspiration for buddhahood. Then in verse
                                he tells the story of how, many eons ago, there was a buddha named
                                Gaṇeśvara. The king Varapuṣpasa listened to his teachings on
                                emptiness and with his five hundred sons became ordained. In a later
                                time, after Gaṇeśvara’s nirvāṇa, there was a prince named Puṇyamatin
                                who was a student of a bhikṣu named Yaśaḥprabha, who had a great
                                following. Other bhikṣus, who were jealous of him, tried to kill
                                him. But because of the power of the truth of his teachings, their
                                weapons changed to flowers. The Buddha explains that at that time,
                                he was Yaśaḥprabha, Maitreya was Puṇyamatin, and King Varapuṣpasa
                                later became Buddha Padmottara. The Buddha subsequently extols the
                                virtues of patience. Then Śākyamuni gives teachings on how to
                                practice the path to buddhahood.</p>

                            <p tid="78">The Buddha teaches to Candraprabha all the various
                                qualities, manners, and results of restraining the body. He tells
                                the story of how, many eons ago, at the time of Buddha
                                Jñānaprabhāsa, there lived King Viveśacintin, who received from him
                                this teaching on physical restraint, given in verse form. The king
                                became a bhikṣu, and the Buddha states that the king was one of his
                                own previous lives. The Buddha then gives a description of the
                                restraint of the speech and the mind—its conduct, wisdom, and
                                results.</p>

                                samādhi that were given in chapter 1. There are some variances,
                                particularly of omission, but the qualities are said by the Buddha
                                to number three hundred. </p>

                        Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha together with a great bhikṣu saṅgha of a full
                        hundred thousand bhikṣus, and together with eighty quintillion<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-055-001-89" index="8"> This number depends
                            on whether <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niyuta</foreign> is
                            taken to mean “one million,” as in Classical Sanskrit, or “a hundred
                            thousand million,” as is found in BHS. The Tibetan has chosen the latter
                            meaning, translating it as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">khrag
                                khrig</foreign>. Therefore the resulting number in Tibetan is “ten
                            million [times] a hundred thousand million times eighty,” i.e., eighty
                            million million million (eighty quintillion in the American or short
                            scale system) (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">bye ba khrag

                            translation of the commentary by Mañjuśrīkīrti, however, has <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">khrag khrig phrag brgyad
                                bcu</foreign>: “a hundred thousand million times eighty,” which
                            would be eight million million, i.e., eight trillion. The Vaidya
                            Sanskrit edition has <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">niyuta­śata­sahasrena aśītyā</foreign> which would be literally “a

                            eighty,” which comes to eight hundred thousand million million, i.e.,
                            eight hundred thousand trillion. However if <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niyuta</foreign> is taken as only one million, this
                            would be eight million million, i.e., eight trillion, which would agree
                            with the resulting number in Mañjuśrīkīrti’s commentary. The Dutt

                            the right time, and teaching the Dharma correctly.” In this translation,

                            (“beautiful faculties”). The commentary states that this means seeing

                            incorrect, and teaching others according to their aspirations. However,
                            both the commentary and the definition in chapter 40 have subsumed the

                                attain miraculous powers. He succeeded and was famous for being able

                                The common English name is “needle bush,” because of its numerous

                                According to the Sanskrit, which has the adjective “little,” and
                                also the account in the Vinaya, which states that as a monk in the
                                time of Buddha Kāśyapa he cut down the thorny bush at the entrance
                                of his cave because it always snagged his robes. Cutting down bushes
                                or even grass is contrary to the bhikṣu rules. Therefore he was
                                reborn as a nāga with a tree growing out of his head. This caused
                                him pain whenever the wind blew. In Chinese the word <foreign xml:lang="zh" type="term">小</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Zh-Ltn" type="term">xiao</foreign>), as an adjective,
                                means “little,” as in the Sanskrit. As a verb it means “belittle” or
                                “make something small.” The main verb used is <foreign xml:lang="zh" type="term">壞</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Zh-Ltn" type="term">huai</foreign>), i.e., “to destroy or damage,” rather than “to
                                cut down.” These two verbs together, <foreign xml:lang="zh" type="quote">壞小</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Zh-Ltn" type="quote">huai xiao</foreign>), could be interpreted as
                                “cutting the bush to make it small,” or “cutting the bush in
                                contempt.” </note>

                                that contains the hells, in which case it is equivalent to the

                                the hells. More commonly it is the name of the outer ring of
                                mountains at the edge of the flat disk that is the world, with
                                Sumeru in the center. This is also equated with Vaḍaba, the heat of
                                which evaporates the ocean so that it does not overflow. Jambudvīpa,
                                the world of humans is in this sea to Sumeru’s south. However, it is

                            <term type="definition">A gandharva who was very prominent in early
                                Buddhism and is featured on early stupa reliefs playing a lute and
                                singing. He would come to Buddha Śākyamuni, who was not portrayed as
                                omniscient, to inform him of what was occuring in the paradises. He
                                also accompanies Indra on a visit to the Buddha and plays music to
                                bring the Buddha out of his meditation. He performs the same role in
                                the Mahāyāna sūtra The White Lotus of Compassion. He was portrayed
                                as living on a five-peaked mountain, and appears to be the basis for
                                Mañjuśrī, first known as Mañjughoṣa (Beautiful Voice) with <term type="ignore">Pañcaśikha</term> still being one of Mañjuśrī’s
                                alternate names. In this sūtra he is clearly distinct from
                                Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī.</term>

                                are listed as either five or six. The first five are: clairvoyance
                                (divine sight), divine hearing, knowing how to manifest miracles,
                                remembering previous lives, knowing what is in the minds of others.
                                A sixth, knowing that all defects have been eliminated, is often
                                added. The first five are attained through dhyāna, and are sometimes
                                described as worldly, as they can be attained to some extent by
                                non-Buddhist yogis; while the sixth is supramundane and attained
                                only by realization—by bodhisattvas, or according to some accounts
                                only by buddhas.</term>

                                probably meaning “flower on the front” or “face with a flower.” It
                                was made by metallurgists, presumably from gold. The Tibetan has a

                                flower—possibly a face within a flower as is seen on ancient stūpa
