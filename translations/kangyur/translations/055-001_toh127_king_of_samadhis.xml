                <p tid="1">This sūtra, much quoted in later Buddhist writings for its profound statements especially on the nature
                    of emptiness, relates a long teaching given by the Buddha mainly in response to questions put by a young
                    layman, Candraprabha. The samādhi that is the subject of the sūtra, in spite of its name, primarily consists
                    of various aspects of conduct, motivation, and the understanding of emptiness; it is also a way of referring
                    to the sūtra itself. The teaching given in the sūtra is the instruction to be dedicated to the possession and
                    promulgation of the samādhi, and to the necessary conduct of a bodhisattva, which is exemplified by a number
                    of accounts from the Buddha’s previous lives. Most of the teaching takes place on Vulture Peak Mountain, with
                    an interlude recounting the Buddha’s invitation and visit to Candraprabha’s home in Rājagṛha, where he
                    continues to teach Candraprabha before returning to Vulture Peak Mountain. In one subsequent chapter the
                    Buddha responds to a request by Ānanda, and the text concludes with a commitment by Ānanda to maintain this
                    teaching in the future. </p>

                            Sūtra,</title> is one of the earlier Mahāyāna sūtras to appear in India. It contains teachings on
                        emptiness, bodhisattva conduct, and mendicancy, as well as tales of previous lifetimes and prophecies for
                        the future. Its teaching on emptiness is much quoted by such Mādhyamaka masters as Candrakīrti and
                        Śāntideva, as well as in later Buddhist literature. </p>

                    <p tid="4">The <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">samādhi</foreign> of the title does not simply refer to
                        meditation, but is used to designate both the sūtra itself and an entire range of Buddhist practices for
                        conduct, meditation, motivation, and realization. The sūtra enumerates over three hundred of the samādhi’s
                        qualities. One of the samādhi’s main descriptive epithets is given in the long form of the title itself as
                        “the revealed<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-055-001-5" index="1"> According to the BHS <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vipañcita</foreign>.

                        However, far from being a systematic textbook on the features of any one practice or doctrine, the sūtra
                        has a complex, convoluted structure and includes long narrative passages. These not only relate the
                        Buddha’s interactions with Candraprabha, the main interlocutor, but also tell lengthy stories in mixed
                        prose and verse from the Buddha’s past lives—in his own words—exemplifying the points he teaches.
                        Interspersed in these narratives, often in the form of verse teachings given by past tathāgatas, are some
                        of the profound statements on the nature of phenomena, and on the essential points of the path, for which
                        the sūtra is justly celebrated. </p>

                    <p tid="5">As is the case for most sūtras, it is impossible to be sure when this work first appeared in
                        writing; indeed, the sūtra is very likely a compilation of earlier shorter works. None of the complete
                        extant Sanskrit manuscripts can be dated to earlier than the sixth century. There is, however, a reference
                        to it in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sūtrasamuccaya</title>, a work attributed to Nāgārjuna (second or
                        third century) although the attribution is not universally accepted. There is even a claim that the <title xml:lang="en">King of Samādhis Sūtra</title> was translated into Chinese in 148 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, but this, too,
                        is disputed. The mention of a <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Samādhirāja</title> in Asaṅga’s fourth century
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­yāna­saṃgraha</title> may be a reference to the sūtra.</p>

                    <p tid="6">At least two shorter independent works that may have existed earlier appear to have been
                        incorporated into the <title xml:lang="en">King of Samādhis Sūtra</title>. One is a text entitled <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­prajñā­samādhi­sūtra</title> (<title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra of the Samādhi of
                            Great Wisdom</title>) or <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mañjuśrī­bodhi­sattva­cāryā</title> (<title xml:lang="en">The Bodhisattva Conduct of Mañjuśrī</title>). It is a teaching on the six perfections
                        that must have existed as early as the fifth century, as it was translated into Chinese by Shih Sien-kung
                        (420–479). It corresponds to chapters 27–29 of the <title xml:lang="en">King of Samādhis Sūtra</title> in
                        the Tibetan version, except that the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­prajñā­samādhi­sūtra</title> has
                        Mañjuśrī as the recipient of the teaching instead of Candraprabha (both bodhisattvas have the title
                        Kumārabhūta). </p>

                            Sūtra</title>, which also appears to have originally been an independent text; its interlocutor is

                    <p tid="9">The entire sūtra was translated into Chinese by Narendrayaśas in 557. Narendrayaśas (517–589) was a
                        much-traveled Indian monk from Orissa who arrived in China in 556. This Chinese version is widely known
                        under an alternative title, <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Candra­pradīpa­samādhi­sūtra</title> (<title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra of the Samādhi of the Lamp of the Moon</title>, Taishō 639); this title is
                        closely related to the alternative title used in some Indian commentaries (see below). Narendrayaśas’s
                        translation is divided into ten chapters, in contrast to the forty of the Tibetan. There are fragments of
                        three Sanskrit manuscripts from central Asia, dated to the fifth or sixth centuries, that correspond to
                        this version, but no complete manuscript has survived. </p>

                        no longer extant, but longer than the one translated into Chinese. The Tibetan was translated during the
                        reign of King Ralpachen (815–838) by Śīlendrabodhi and Chönyi Tsultrim (who used the Sanskrit version of
                        his name, Dharmatāśīla).</p>

                    <p tid="11">The earliest complete Indian manuscript to have survived is the one discovered in 1938 in the
                        ruins of a library near Gilgit. It is dated, from the calligraphy of its Gupta script, to the sixth
                        century. It has some additional verses that do not appear in the Chinese version, but is significantly
                        shorter than the Tibetan translation, with fewer verses and prose passages. Much closer to the Tibetan is
                        a group of twelve later Sanskrit manuscripts found in Nepal, including the one referred to here as the
                        Hodgson manuscript; another group of Nepalese manuscripts contain additional material usually not found in
                        the Tibetan, and includes the one referred to here as the Shastri manuscript.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-055-001-14" index="3"> Brian Houghton Hodgson (1801–1894) was a linguist, ethnologist,
                            naturalist, and diplomat who lived in Nepal from 1824 to 1844, becoming British Resident; among his
                            many other activities, he studied and collected Sanskrit Buddhist texts. Haraprasad Shastri
                            (1853–1931) was an Indian Sanskrit scholar and historian who visited Nepal several times, also
                            collecting and publishing manuscripts. Both scholars were associated with the Asiatic Society in
                            Kolkata. The Sanskrit edition of the sūtra published by Dutt (as one of a series centered on the
                            Gilgit manuscripts; see bibliography) is not only based on the Gilgit manuscript, but also represents
                            the Hodgson and Shastri manuscripts, which Dutt refers to, respectively, as manuscripts A and
                            B.</note>

                        Hybrid Sanskrit (BHS). The prose is in what appears to be classical Sanskrit in terms of spelling and case
                        endings, but the vocabulary includes words that are only found in BHS, or words that exist in classical
                        Sanskrit but have a different meaning in BHS. </p>

                        referred to as having thirty-eight chapters, but a closer look reveals that there are two additional
                        untitled final chapters. The Tibetan, unlike the Sanskrit versions, does not make a final chapter from the
                        conclusion, and does not divide its chapter 39 on the restraint of the body, speech, and mind into three
                        chapters, but it does make a short chapter 22 from what, in the Sanskrit, constitutes the end of chapter 21.</p>

                        and follow a life of extreme mendicancy followed. Nevertheless, more than two hundred years after it had

                        the sūtra is revered in the Kagyu tradition, the monastic lineage of which was founded by Gampopa, is
                        perhaps that Gampopa’s Kadampa teacher Potowa is said to have identified him as the rebirth of
                        Candraprabha, the interlocutor of the <title xml:lang="en">King of Samādhis</title>. Gampopa used the name

                        in his colophons, and later teachers sometimes referred to him by that name. Since Gampopa himself is
                        nevertheless not known to have been a promulgator of the sūtra, in order to conform to the prophecy it has
                        been claimed that it represents a sūtra version of Gampopa’s Mahāmudrā teaching—but not explicitly so, and
                        indeed the reader will not find any such doctrinal elements that set its viewpoint particularly apart from

                        to attain for householders, and likens nirvāṇa to a flame being extinguished, bringing any activity to an
                        end. In it, the Buddha emphasizes again and again the vast number of eons during which he and other
                        tathāgatas practiced before attaining enlightenment.</p>

                        mendicancy, insisting that a bhikṣu should remain in the forest and have no possessions, it condemns the
                        corruption of bhikṣus who accumulate possessions and visit laypeople’s homes to teach them there. Its
                        strict adherence to the forest lifestyle, and its condemnation of bhikṣus who do not follow it, would not
                        have found wide favor in some of the Buddhist establishments of that time. The sūtra also addresses the
                        known problem of that time of destitute people who joined the ranks of Buddhist monks in order to receive
                        material support for themselves, without having any genuine dedication to or understanding of the

                        place it was promulgated. Another—one of its less appealing aspects for our present age, but one that is
                        typical of many early Mahāyāna sūtras—is its attitude toward women: the bodhisattva is always male, as is
                        explicit in the Sanskrit (although in this translation frequent use has been made of the plural
                        to render bodhisattvas’ male gender less obvious). Women often appear as property
                        that is given away, and the noble kings have harems as well as slaves, though the Tibetan did not have the
                        term to translate <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">antapuraḥ</foreign> (harem) and used the more
                        palatable “retinue of queens.” However, women are still seen as capable of being devotees of the path of
                        the sūtra, and in particular there is the tale of Princess Jñānāvatī, who cuts off the flesh from her
                        thigh so as to heal her sick bhikṣu teacher. But in every such case this means that the woman will gain a
                        male rebirth so that she may be able to continue on the path to enlightenment.</p>

                        Mahāyāna sūtras before the rise of Avalokiteśvara to preeminence by the fourth or fifth century. </p>

                        Tibetan, an English translation could never represent all versions equally, and necessarily involves a
                        selective approach based on stated principles. In this translation of the <title xml:lang="en">King of
                            Samādhis</title>, we have chosen to stay as close as possible to the Tibetan of the Kangyur, which has
                        more content than both the Chinese translation and the Gilgit manuscript. However, we have compared the
                        Tibetan closely to the Chinese and Gilgit versions, along with the two longer Nepalese Sanskrit
                        manuscripts identified in this translation as Shastri and Hodgson (see above). Discrepancies between the
                        versions are recorded in the notes. </p>

                        wherever possible, as it probably represents a particular Sanskrit version that has not survived. In some
                        instances, however, adhering to the Tibetan would have caused problems regarding the meaning of the text,
                        and here the Sanskrit reading has been preferred. Consulting the other versions has also been
                        indispensable in clearing up ambiguities, variations in the Tibetan between the different Kangyurs, and
                        the occasional error in the Tibetan, the results of scribal corruption or adopting the wrong meaning of a
                        word, such as the classical Sanskrit meaning instead of the BHS meaning. Also of great help has been
                        clarification from the Chinese translation that Ling-Lung Chen has been able to provide. In one case, the
                        Chinese preserves an uncorrupted version of a passage in which “nature” was later replaced by “past,”
                        resulting in a peculiar set of verses with a peculiar meaning.</p>

                                his home. He then describes how in the past there was a buddha named Ghoṣadatta. A king named

                            <p tid="44">The Buddha tells Candraprabha that a bodhisattva needs to attain three kinds of patience.
                                The first patience is to maintain the Dharma by not arguing, and so on; to know that everything is
                                an illusion; to know the sūtras; to have no doubt; to have no anger toward tīrthikas; to speak
                                truthfully; never to abandon the path to buddhahood; and to master worldly skills. The second
                                patience is having undisturbed śamatha and vipaśyanā, being in meditation during all activity,
                                attaining the five higher cognitions, having miraculous powers, and remembering every word that is
                                taught. With the third patience the bodhisattva can see all other worlds, has a golden body,
                                teaches millions of beings, receives the prophecy of his buddhahood, and being aware of emptiness
                                he remains unaffected by praise or blame, loss or gain.</p>

                                nonexistence of phenomena so that he will have no desire. He adds that in the past there was a
                                buddha named Abhāva­samudgata, who at birth levitated and declared the nonexistence of all
                                phenomena, following which all the sounds in the world made the same declaration. Later, a prince
                                named Mahā­karuṇā­cintin became one of his bhikṣus, received the teaching of this sūtra, and

                                realizing that everything is like a dream or an illusion, so that there is no desire, anger, or
                                ignorance. He teaches that one should avoid association with fools, and with those who have become
                                bhikṣus as a source of livelihood. He teaches that one should not only give the teachings but also
                                practice and realize them.</p>

                                Throughout the night, he prepares a sumptuous meal. He then adorns the city and his own home.
                                Accompanied by bodhisattvas and citizens he goes to Vulture Peak Mountain to invite the Buddha to

                                takes his first step into the city. Everyone in the world becomes happy and deities make vast

                                will enable him to accomplish that. The Buddha states that only one quality is necessary, which is
                                the knowledge of the insubstantial nature of phenomena. He also describes the vast merit and good
                                results that come from knowing even one verse of this sūtra. Candraprabha aspires to be a keeper
                                of this sūtra in the future. The Buddha prophesies to many millions of beings who are present that

                                from all bondage and masters all the skills of words and teaching.</p>

                                taught him the samādhi and he was cured. Then the Buddha prophesies that in the future there will

                            <p tid="54">The bodhisattva Maitreya tells the Buddha he is going to Vulture Peak Mountain in order to
                                prepare offerings to the Buddha. When he arrives there he transforms it into a flat, divinely
                                adorned ground with a throne in its center. Then he returns to Candraprabha’s home and describes
                                what he has created. The Buddha returns to the mountain and sits on the throne. Candraprabha and
                                millions of others also come to the mountain and Candraprabha requests a teaching. The Buddha
                                describes four qualities necessary for attaining the samādhi of this sūtra: the first is calmness
                                and self-restraint, the second is correct conduct, the third is fear of the three realms, and the
                                fourth is devotion to the Dharma and benefiting others. Then in verse the Buddha describes a
                                succession of buddhas within two eons of the distant past. He states that whoever hears their
                                names will quickly attain this samādhi. Then he recounts that they were followed by a buddha named
                                Narendraghoṣa. At that time the Buddha was a king named Śirībala, who with five hundred sons
                                received this samādhi teaching from Narendraghoṣa. He and his sons all became bhikṣus. Śirībala
                                was then reborn as the son of King Dṛḍhabala. The prince, remembering millions of previous lives,
                                asks if the Buddha Narendraghoṣa is still alive, and describes and praises his teaching of this
                                samādhi. King Dṛḍhabala brings his son, along with millions of other people, to that buddha, hears
                                the teaching, and becomes a bhikṣu. Sixty eons later King Dṛḍhabala becomes Buddha Padmottara, and
                                all his subjects who became bhikṣus all eventually become buddhas who all have the same name:
                                Ananta­jñānanottara. The five hundred sons became the five hundred students of Śākyamuni who would
                                in future times teach this sūtra. King Dṛḍhabala and his queen also became the Buddha’s parents:
                                Śuddhodana and Māyādevī.</p>

                            <p tid="55">The Buddha tells Candraprabha that a bodhisattva who possesses this samādhi has four
                                qualities: unsurpassable merit, being invincible to adversaries, unlimited wisdom, and an unending
                                eloquence. Candraprabha asks the Buddha who will listen to this samādhi in the future. The Buddha
                                says that only bhikṣus with pure mendicancy will have faith in it. Those who reject it will have
                                incalculable bad karma. Candraprabha vows to promulgate the sūtra in a future life and endure the
                                abuse of those with no faith in it. Eight hundred others also vow to uphold the sūtra and eight
                                hundred million deities vow to protect them. The Buddha gives his blessing, the world shakes, and
                                the Buddha prophesies the buddhahood of the millions of beings who have listened to the sūtra.</p>

                                Dharma is attained. Candraprabha, listening to the teaching, attains that samādhi. A thousand
                                million worlds shake as a result. A multitude of devas rejoice that they have also heard this
                                teaching. The gandharva Pañcaśikha with five hundred other gandharvas fly down to Vulture Peak
                                Mountain and play music as an offering. The Buddha causes the teaching of the inconceivable Dharma
                                to come from the sound of their music. The teaching describes the unreality of existence and the
                                benefits of nonattachment and equanimity. </p>

                                avoiding the influence of bad companions. The verses describe how in the distant past, a king came
                                across two renunciants in the forest and was inspired by them. However, bhikṣus who disliked their
                                ascetic lifestyle and views urged the king to kill or banish them. A goddess who looked after the
                                king’s benefit countered their influence. They succeeded in influencing the king’s brother and he
                                led an army to the forest. The deities of the forest massacred them and all involved in the plot
                                were reborn in hell. The Buddha explains that the two monks were Buddha Dīpaṃkara and himself, the
                                king was Maitreya, and Candraprabha was the goddess.</p>

                                attachments will commit bad actions and go to hell after death.</p>

                                form body, but as the dharmakāya, the “Dharma body,” which is indescribable and unquantifiable.
                                Even though someone sees the physical presence of a buddha, that is a manifestation of the
                                dharmakāya, and it is the dharmakāya that is the Buddha’s true body, which cannot be perceived as
                                having any features or actions. </p>

                                of discernment: discernment of phenomena, of meaning, of definitions, and of confident speech. He
                                then gives a long explanation of the discernment of phenomena, in which successive qualities are
                                explained in relation to four aspects: the composite teaching, the composite, the kleśas, and
                                purification. For each of these there is an inconceivable number of each quality. The second,
                                third, and fourth discernments are explained in single brief sentences. The concluding verses
                                state that the Buddha has innumerable qualities, and exhort the teaching of this sūtra.</p>

                            <p tid="62">The Buddha teaches Candraprabha in greater depth on the discernment of phenomena,
                                emphasizing that there is no difference between the nature of phenomena and enlightenment, and
                                specifying that there is no difference between the nature of the skandhas and enlightenment. Then
                                in verse he teaches the emptiness of phenomena and nirvāṇa, and that his true body is not his
                                “form body,” the rūpakāya, but his dharmakāya, and therefore the only one who has truly seen a
                                buddha is one who has seen the dharmakāya, who has seen emptiness. There follows a condemnation of
                                bhikṣus of the future who will be concerned with gain and honors, and will teach and become
                                involved with laypeople, and are destined for the hells. However, there should be no anger toward
                                them; they should be treated with respect. There is also advice on humility and circumspection in
                                giving teachings, as to who should be taught and what kind of teaching should be given. There is
                                also an exhortation to make offerings, but also that the merit gained from this sūtra is far more
                                vast than the most extensive offerings.</p>

                                diligence, meditation, and wisdom. They are followed by the benefits of becoming very learned in
                                the Dharma, giving the Dharma to others, maintaining the knowledge of emptiness, maintaining
                                detachment in meditation, remaining in solitude, and following a mendicant lifestyle and begging
                                for alms. The Buddha concludes by stating that such a bodhisattva will obtain, through the
                                supernatural higher cognitions, the treasure of the buddhas because he will be able to see them
                                all. And he will attain the treasure of the Dharma because he can hear the buddhas teaching. He
                                will attain the treasure of wisdom because he remembers the teaching and knows how to give it to
                                others. Finally, he will attain the treasure of knowing the past, present, and future of
                                beings.</p>

                            <p tid="67">The Buddha tells Candraprabha that he should be dedicated to this sūtra and live alone in
                                the forest. In the verse he tells how, in the distant past, there was a buddha named Tejaguṇarāja
                                and at that time Buddha Śākyamuni was a world ruler named Dṛdhadatta. When he heard the teaching
                                of the <title xml:lang="en">King of Samādhis Sūtra</title>, he and the entire population of the
                                world became bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs who were supported by the devas. The Buddha describes the
                                nature of degenerate Dharma teachers in future times, who do not practice mendicancy. He
                                prescribes making images of the Buddha, making offerings to him, and aspiring to the teaching of
                                this sūtra. The Buddha then describes the various great qualities that those who possess this
                                sūtra will have.</p>

                                their various languages should be dedicated to this sūtra. In eleven verses, he describes various
                                benefits, and particularly the qualities of speech, that will be gained.</p>

                            <p tid="69">The Buddha teaches that a bodhisattva who wishes to know the nature of phenomena should be
                                dedicated to this sūtra. He describes in verse the compassion, patience, ability to remember and
                                teach, generosity, and diligence that is the nature of the bodhisattva who realizes the nature of
                                phenomena, which is peace and emptiness. He states that this is the path he followed, and
                                encourages all to follow his example. He states that those who reject the path to enlightenment
                                spend eons in the hells, but those who teach and protect this sūtra in future times will quickly
                                attain enlightenment.</p>

                            <label>Chapter 33: The Benefits of Possessing the Sūtra</label>
                            <p tid="70">The Buddha teaches that dedication to this sūtra will bring the higher cognitions of all
                                phenomena. This is then explained through almost three hundred verses in the Tibetan version. He
                                teaches that the higher cognitions are gained by having no attachment, either to samādhi or
                                worldly things, and by having no pride. The higher cognitions are the realization that there is no
                                substance to anything, even the Buddha’s words. This realization of emptiness brings buddhahood,
                                which does not exist on the <term type="ignore">level</term> of words. Buddhahood has no form; it is the dharmakāya. It
                                transcends every kind of conceptual identification. Those without this understanding believe they
                                have made spiritual progress but still have desire, particularly for women. </p>
                            <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-001-77"/>
                            <p tid="71">Those who have the realization manifest pure realms. While communicating with words, they
                                transcend thought and concepts, have miraculous powers, and do not age. Ordinary humans who
                                delight in this sūtra will proceed to enlightenment and will meet Buddha Maitreya. Maintaining
                                this sūtra in the degenerate age is the greatest offering to the buddhas. Women who have faith in
                                a single verse from it will never be reborn as women. The bodhisattvas who realize this samādhi
                                will have inconceivable qualities and attain buddhahood at Bodhgaya. </p>

                                world, transforming it into a pure realm. Lotuses and birds throughout countless realms will emit
                                the words of the Dharma. The bodhisattva who practices this sūtra has immaculate conduct and at
                                death will go to Sukhāvatī, and in the degenerate age will be the protector of the Dharma.</p>

                            <p tid="73">The Buddha teaches that the bodhisattva who wishes to attain this sūtra’s samādhi and
                                enlightenment should make extensive offerings to a living buddha or to a stūpa containing his
                                relics, and relates a story as an example. The story is about a king named Śrīghoṣa who made
                                extensive offerings to millions of stūpas containing the relics of Buddha Ghoṣadatta—presumably
                                the same buddha who appears in chapter 5. One night he offers millions of lamps to the stūpas. On
                                seeing this, a young bodhisattva named Kṣemadatta makes a lamp out of his hand by wrapping it in
                                cloth and dousing it in sesame oil. The light from this lamp eclipses all the other light
                                offerings, and the hand is burned away. The king and his queens leap from their high palace roof
                                to go and see this, but are not hurt thanks to intervention by deities. The king approaches
                                Kṣemadatta, admires him, and expresses sorrow for the loss of his hand. Kṣemadatta recites a verse
                                on emptiness, and because of the truth of his words, his hand grows back and there are other
                                miracles. The Buddha then states that he was Kṣemadatta and that Maitreya was King Śrīghoṣa.</p>

                            <p tid="74">The Buddha instructs Candraprabha on four kinds of dedication of merit from acts of
                                generosity. He then states that a bodhisattva should give even his own flesh to heal a teacher of
                                the Dharma from illness. He then tells the story of how, eons ago, Princess Jñānāvatī followed the
                                instructions given to her in a dream, which were to use her own flesh and blood to treat her sick

                                off her own flesh. The Buddha states that he was that princess in a previous lifetime, her father
                                the king was Maitreya, and the Dharma teacher became Buddha Dīpaṃkara.</p>

                            <label>Chapter 36: Supuṣpacandra</label>
                            <p tid="75">In this chapter, one of the longest in the sūtra, there is no mention of Candraprabha.
                                Instead, Ānanda requests teaching from the Buddha, and the Buddha states that a bodhisattva must
                                have equanimity and not cease in his progress to enlightenment, no matter what suffering he
                                endures. The Buddha gives the example of Supuṣpacandra. In an eon long ago, Buddha
                                Ratna­padma­candra­viśuddhābhyud­gata­rāja attained enlightenment, liberated countless beings, and
                                passed into nirvāṇa all in one day. During the last five hundred years of his teaching, all
                                bodhisattvas had been exiled to Samantabhadra Forest. Supuṣpacandra was with them as their
                                teacher, but saw that the time had come to teach other beings, even if it cost him his life. In
                                the story, he leaves alone and eventually reaches the capital, where, in the course of a week, he
                                establishes countless beings on the path to enlightenment, including King Śūradatta’s harem of
                                eighty thousand queens, and all his thousand sons. On the seventh day, when the king is in a large
                                procession heading to a park, he witnesses the devotion of the populace, and his own family, to a
                                bhikṣu who is standing by the road. Consumed with jealousy, he orders his executioner to slay the
                                bhikṣu. The executioner cuts him up into eight pieces. When the king is returning to his capital
                                after a week he sees that the body parts have not decayed. Also the townspeople and the
                                bodhisattvas of the forest have come and discovered the death. Filled with remorse, the king
                                arranges a cremation and the building of a stūpa for the relics, and for thousands of years makes
                                offerings, confesses his crime, and keeps perfect discipline. Nevertheless, he is reborn in hell
                                and for millions of eons experiences various mutilations and sufferings as a result of his action.
                                The Buddha then states that King Śūradatta was one of his own previous lives, and Supuṣpacandra
                                subsequently became Buddha Padmottara.</p>

                                then recites verses, stating that possessing and reciting this sūtra, even one verse of it, has
                                greater merit than eons of generosity, and that it contains an incalculable number of teachings.
                                Then the qualities are described of the bhikṣu bodhisattva who has this sūtra, concluding by
                                saying that many eons would not suffice to describe them all.</p>

                            <p tid="77">The Buddha says to Candraprabha that a bodhisattva should dedicate himself to ending the
                                kleśas, gaining merit, and generating roots of goodness out of an aspiration for buddhahood. Then
                                in verse he tells the story of how, many eons ago, there was a buddha named Gaṇeśvara. The king
                                Varapuṣpasa listened to his teachings on emptiness and with his five hundred sons became ordained.
                                In a later time, after Gaṇeśvara’s nirvāṇa, there was a prince named Puṇyamatin who was a student
                                of a bhikṣu named Yaśaḥprabha, who had a great following. Other bhikṣus, who were jealous of him,
                                tried to kill him. But because of the power of the truth of his teachings, their weapons changed
                                to flowers. The Buddha explains that at that time, he was Yaśaḥprabha, Maitreya was Puṇyamatin,
                                and King Varapuṣpasa later became Buddha Padmottara. The Buddha subsequently extols the virtues of
                                patience. Then Śākyamuni gives teachings on how to practice the path to buddhahood.</p>

                                and the mind—its conduct, wisdom, and results.</p>

                    <p tid="82">Thus have I heard at one time: The Bhagavān was residing at Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha
                        together with a great bhikṣu saṅgha of a full hundred thousand bhikṣus, and together with eighty
                            quintillion<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-055-001-89" index="8"> This number depends on whether
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niyuta</foreign> is taken to mean “one million,” as in
                            Classical Sanskrit, or “a hundred thousand million,” as is found in BHS. The Tibetan has chosen the
                            latter meaning, translating it as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">khrag khrig</foreign>.
                            Therefore the resulting number in Tibetan is “ten million [times] a hundred thousand million times
                            eighty,” i.e., eighty million million million (eighty quintillion in the American or short scale
                            system) (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">bye ba khrag khrig phrag brgyad bcu</foreign>,
                            apparently translating <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">koṭiniyutena aśityā</foreign>). The
                            translation of the commentary by Mañjuśrīkīrti, however, has <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">khrag khrig phrag brgyad bcu</foreign>: “a hundred thousand million times eighty,” which would be
                            eight million million, i.e., eight trillion. The Vaidya Sanskrit edition has <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">niyuta­śata­sahasrena aśītyā</foreign> which would be literally “a
                            hundred thousand million [times] a hundred [times] a thousand times eighty,” which comes to eight
                            hundred thousand million million, i.e., eight hundred thousand trillion. However if <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niyuta</foreign> is taken as only one million, this would be eight
                            million million, i.e., eight trillion, which would agree with the resulting number in Mañjuśrīkīrti’s
                            commentary. The Dutt edition of the Gilgit manuscript has <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">aśityā ca bodhisattva-niyutaiḥ</foreign> and accordingly the translation of Gómez et al. is
                            “eighty million,” where <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niyuta</foreign> has presumably been
                            given the value of one million. The Chinese simply transliterates as <foreign xml:lang="Zh-Ltn" type="term">na-yo-ta</foreign>. The Chinese tradition gives numerous, widely differing

                                Kāśyapa he cut down the thorny bush at the entrance of his cave because it always snagged his

                                said to be the entrance to the hells. More commonly it is the name of the outer ring of mountains
                                at the edge of the flat disk that is the world, with Sumeru in the center. This is also equated
                                with Vaḍaba, the heat of which evaporates the ocean so that it does not overflow. Jambudvīpa, the
                                world of humans is in this sea to Sumeru’s south. However, it is also used to mean the entire

                                stupa reliefs playing a lute and singing. He would come to Buddha Śākyamuni, who was not portrayed
                                as omniscient, to inform him of what was occuring in the paradises. He also accompanies Indra on a
                                visit to the Buddha and plays music to bring the Buddha out of his meditation. He performs the
                                same role in the Mahāyāna sūtra The White Lotus of Compassion. He was portrayed as living on a
                                five-peaked mountain, and appears to be the basis for Mañjuśrī, first known as Mañjughoṣa
