                    <p tid="5">The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāraṇḍavyūha </title>is an early Mantrayāna sūtra that is the source
                        of the mantra <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ maṇipadme hūṁ</mantra>. The sūtra is thus of
                        particular importance, as this mantra now holds a central role in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition,
                        especially throughout the lay population. This sūtra also records Avalokiteśvara’s transformation into the
                        principal figure of the Buddhist pantheon, greater than all other buddhas, let alone bodhisattvas. In this
                        sūtra, Avalokiteśvara is a resident of Sukhavātī and acts as a messenger and gift bearer for Amitābha,
                        even though he is also described as superior to all buddhas and therefore paradoxically has both a
                        subservient and dominant status. </p>

                        around the fifth century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. In terms of place, the text indicates familiarity with the cesspits of
                        Vārāṇasī, and assumes the reader’s knowledge of Candradvīpa, the southern part of Bengal where the Ganges
                        Delta is situated. In the Tibetan version, the merchants who wish to sail to Laṅka ask whether the winds
                        are blowing toward the land of the Greeks. This appears to locate their port of departure on the northwest
                        coast of India. In terms of time, the text is located within a culture where the Mahābhārata and the
                        Purāṇas had a dominant place in Indian culture, particularly the Skandha Pūraṇa, probably during the Gupta
                        period of the third to fifth century.</p>

                    <p tid="7">The earliest surviving manuscript is comprised of fragmentary pages from two manuscripts discovered
                        within a Gilgit stūpa in the 1940s. It was written in a hybrid of Middle Indic and Sanskrit, now called
                        Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, which was frequently used in sūtras. Adhelheid Mette, who has published these
                        fragments, suggests that it was composed in the fourth or fifth century;<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-051-004-499" index="1">Mette (2005).</note> the script in which it is written had fallen out of
                        use by the early seventh century, and the fragments show variations between the two manuscripts that are
                        the result of the texts having gone through generations of copying. Other existing Sanskrit manuscripts
                        (see below) date from a century or more later than the ninth century Tibetan translation.</p>

                        Chinese again. However, this is a case of misidentification. The sūtra they translated was the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratna­karaṇḍa­vyūha</title>. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāraṇḍavyūha
                        </title>itself was not translated into Chinese until 983 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, considerably later than the Tibetan

                        Avalokiteśvara’s qualities given in the sūtra is that he terrifies Vajrapāṇi! Vajrapāṇi would soon join
                        Mañjuśrī and Avalokiteśvara to form the principal trinity of bodhisattvas in the early tantra

                        The origin of the popular four-armed version of Avalokiteśvara appears within the sūtra as the goddess who

                        collections of scriptures. These <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">siddhas</foreign> are also

                    <p tid="21">Another word for basket is <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">piṭaka</foreign>, which forms

                        seem to mean “precious casket,” but the contents of that sūtra validate the Tibetan translation as <title xml:lang="en">The Basket of the [Three] Jewels </title>(<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dkon mchog gi za ma

                        describes how the sūtra was composed within the context of familiarity with, and under the influence of,
                        Purāṇic literature, in particular the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Skandapurāṇa</title>. In this sūtra,
                        Avalokiteśvara has taken on various attributes and characteristics of Śiva, to the extent that one passage
                        could be misread as describing Avalokiteśvara to be the creator of the universe. Even so, he is still
                        being described as the creator of its deities, including Śiva and Viṣṇu. In particular, Avalokiteśvara’s
                        mantra is evidence of the influence of Śiva’s five-syllable mantra, <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ namaḥ śivāya</mantra> (“<mantra xml:lang="mixed">
                            <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Oṁ</foreign>—Homage to Śiva!</mantra>”), which is found in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Skandapurāṇa</title>

                    <p tid="30">The sūtra itself is rarely read in Tibet, other than in the annual ritual chanting of the Kangyur,
                        and as mentioned above it has been eclipsed by the eleventh-century <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Maṇi
                            Kabum</title>. There is no evidence of it having had any significant impact on religious life in Tibet
                        in the preceding centuries. In spite of the eventual importance of the <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ maṇipadme hūṁ</mantra> mantra, the sūtra is still primarily known only through
                        select quotations. One reason for this is that very little of the teaching and meditation practice of the
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Maṇi Kabum</title> is to be found in the sūtra. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-051-004-25"/>
                    <p tid="31">Another reason is the difficulty involved in reading the sūtra due to its structure of narratives
                        within narratives. After a buddha is initially introduced, he is subsequently only referred to as
                        “Bhagavat,” and it is easy for readers to lose track of which level of the narrative they are reading.
                        Although the speakers’ names were not repeated in the original, we have added them in here for clarity. We
                        have not marked these insertions with square brackets, again for the sake of readability. </p>

                    <p tid="32">Another problem with the sūtra is that although it is a compilation of narratives, the sūtra does
                        not always use its source material in a skillful manner. The Sanskrit original itself does not compare
                        well with the clarity and style of writing found in other sūtras. There are abrupt transitions,
                        inconsistency in the use of pronouns, and the contents of one part of the narrative appear to be in
                        contradiction with those of another. For example, the Buddha tells the tale of the merchants being rescued
                        from the land of the rākṣasīs in the first person, but there are sporadic lapses into what must have been
                        the original third person of the narrative. The asura king Bali’s account of his downfall likewise
                        transitions from a first- to a third-person account. In common with many other Mahāyāna sūtras but perhaps
                        more frequently than most of them, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāraṇḍavyūha</title> refers to itself
                        within its own narrative as a sūtra that is being taught, requested, or longed for, but appears to
                        describe itself as being comprised of verses, almost as if the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāraṇḍavyūha</title> is a different sūtra that is simply being referred to in this sūtra. </p>

                    <p tid="33">The sūtra assumes that the reader is familiar with the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahābhārata
                        </title>and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Rāmāyaṇa</title>, the two great epics of Indian literature, and
                        the story of Viṣṇu’s avatar as a dwarf deceiving Bali, the lord of the asuras. Tibetan readers, however,
                        would be unfamiliar with personages referred to in passing in the text, such as Śukra, who is both the
                        deity of the planet Venus and counselor for the king of the asuras. Viṣṇu is usually referred to as
                        Nārāyaṇa in the sūtra, but in the passage where he rescues the Pāṇḍavas and other kṣatriyas of <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahābhārata</title> fame, he is referred to as Daśarathaputra (“son of Daśaratha”),
                        which is actually the name of Rāma, another of Viṣṇu’s avatars. This may be because the story of the dwarf
                        avatar also appears in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Rāmāyaṇa</title> when it is told to Rāma, that is,
                        Daśarathaputra. </p>

                        original Sanskrit manuscript or later copies of the Tibetan) that affect the narrative or meaning. The
                        omissions are particularly evident when there are lists of qualities or meditations that are more easily
                        left out in the process of copying manuscripts. On the other hand, there are also instances of members of

                    <p tid="38">The most egregious flaw in both the Tibetan and Chinese translations, and one which has already
                        attracted scholarly attention, occurred on rendering the obscure term <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ratikara</foreign>, which literally means “that which creates joy,” and is also the
                        name of one of the apsarases that are in the audience for this sūtra. The later Nepalese version used
                        instead <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dvīpa</foreign>, the common word for “lamp,” but
                        both the Chinese and Tibetan translators, even with the assistance of Sanskrit scholars, were
                        understandably stumped by this odd word, particularly as the <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ratikara</foreign> laughs and speaks. Both Yeshé Dé and T’ien Hsi-tsai chose to make it refer to the
                        rākṣasī wife speaking in her sleep, as she is the only other person in the room and is the merchant’s
                        paramour. This entailed interpolating the word “sleeping” into the translation. However, the
                        result makes little narrative sense, whereas the unlikely meaning of lamp, which we therefore preferred
                        (see <!--2.7-->

                        preserved in the Tibetan translation. The Degé edition and the version in the critical edition of the
                        Kangyur were therefore our principal sources. </p>
                    <p tid="40">Sanskrit manuscripts do not necessarily reflect the original form of a text, even though they are
                        in the original language, because they may have their own accretion of omissions and additions that have
                        occurred in the centuries following the time a Tibetan or Chinese translation was made. There has not yet
                        been a critical edition from all available Sanskrit manuscripts, but we consulted three Sanskrit editions,
                        the most important being a palm-leaf manuscript from the Cambridge University Library, which was written
                        in the beginning of the second millennium before the development of the Devanāgarī script. It is notable
                        for being closer to the Tibetan. Of easier access but less representative of the original text are the
                        Sāmaśrami edition of 1872 and the 1962 Vaidya edition that is based closely on Sāmaśrami. The Sāmaśrami is
                        available on the Online Sanskrit Texts Project of the Theosophical Network, and the Vaidya is openly
                        available on the internet. To complete the translation of some difficult passages, we also referred to the
                        Gilgit manuscript fragments, though they were not readily accessible. Silfung Chen’s online English
                        translation from the Chinese proved interesting in its correspondences with these editions. </p>

                    <p tid="41">Nevertheless, as noted above, there were a number of points where we relied on the Sanskrit to
                        fill in missing elements, words, members of a list, and sometimes whole sentences, although it is possible
                        that some of the latter may have been later additions to improve the flow and clarity of the sūtra’s
                        sometimes clumsy narrative. Where our translation favors the Sanskrit over the Tibetan, annotations
                        indicate that this is the case. </p>
                    <p tid="42">An important objective was readability, so the syntax does not necessarily reflect that of the
                        Tibetan or Sanskrit versions. For example, an active construction may be used instead of a passive
                        construction found in the original. The inconsistencies of first and third person have been resolved, and,
                        as noted above, names are repeated when otherwise the reader might lose track of who is speaking or to
                        whom the text is referring. Hopefully this will make reading the sūtra in English far less challenging
                        than attempting to do so in Tibetan or Sanskrit. Readers will find the variant readings in Tibetan and
                        Sanskrit in the notes if they wish. </p>

                        of iron. Avalokiteśvara teaches the asuras the inconceivable merit that comes from making offerings to a
                        buddha. Bali, the king of the asuras, tells Avalokiteśvara that he had in the past made an offering to the
                        wrong recipient. He had imprisoned all the kṣatriyas, but Viṣṇu secretly freed them and came to him in the
                        form of a dwarf asking for two steps of land. Bali offered him three, but Viṣṇu took on his divine form
                        and covered the whole world in two steps. He then banished Bali to the underworld where he now dwells for
                        having failed to fulfill his promise.</p>
                    <p tid="48">Avalokiteśvara then describes to him the suffering in hells that awaits those who have not made
                        offerings to the Buddha. </p>
                    <p tid="49">Avalokiteśvara then radiates light rays to where Viśvabhū and his pupils are residing in Jetavana
                        Monastery. Bodhisattva Gaganagañja asks Viśvabhū where the lights came from. Viśvabhū states that the
                        lights are a sign that Avalokiteśvara is coming. However, Avalokiteśvara first goes to a land of darkness
                        to teach the yakṣas and rākṣasas about the merit that comes from this sūtra.</p>

                        poor deva. The deva goes into his empty palace to give him whatever he has, but finds it full of jewels
                        and food that he then offers to the brahmin. Avalokiteśvara in the form of the brahmin tells the deva that
                        he is a bodhisattva from Jetavana Monastery.</p>
                    <p tid="51">Avalokiteśvara then descends to Siṃhala Island, the land of the rākṣasīs, in the form of a
                        handsome man. He agrees to be their husband if they follow his instructions, which they do, giving up
                        killing.</p>
                    <p tid="52">Avalokiteśvara then travels to Vārāṇasī, where in the form of a bee he buzzes the prayer of homage
                        to the Three Jewels to the insects in a large cesspit, liberating them.</p>
                    <p tid="53">Avalokiteśvara then goes to Magadhā, where starving beings have been eating each other for twenty
                        years, and he causes a rain of food to fall. One of the people, a man who is hundreds of thousands of
                        years old, realizes that only Avalokiteśvara could have caused this miracle, and tells the others of the
                        benefits of making offerings to him.</p>
                    <p tid="54">Avalokiteśvara then goes to Buddha Viśvabhū. Bodhisattva Gaganagañja meets him, Viśvabhū teaches
                        the six perfections, and the audience disperses. This is the end of part one.</p>

                            Otherwise it could seem to be the description of a conclusion of a section of the book. The uncommon

Neither the Cambridge manuscript nor the

                            here and elsewhere a number of additional divisions into chapters, which they call <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prakaraṇa</foreign>. The text from which the Chinese translation was

                            Avalokiteśvara’s toe. This strange final sentence of the Maheśvara episode, therefore, in which the

                                an important status during the Buddha’s lifetime and only developed his own significant following
                                in the early years of the common era. Vaishnavism developed the theory of ten emanations, or
                                avatars, the ninth being the Buddha. His emanation as a dwarf plays an important role in this
                                sūtra. The Sanskrit etymology of the name is uncertain, but it was already in use in the Vedas,
                                where he is a minor deity, and has been glossed as “one who enters (everywhere).” </term>
