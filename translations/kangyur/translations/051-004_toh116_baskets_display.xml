                    culminates in a description of the extreme rarity of his mantra, which, on the Buddha’s instructions,

                    <p tid="5">The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāraṇḍavyūha </title>is an early Mantrayāna sūtra that is the source
                        of the mantra <foreign type="mantra" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ maṇipadme hūṁ</foreign>. The sūtra is thus of
                        particular importance, as this mantra now holds a central role in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition,
                        especially throughout the lay population. This sūtra also records Avalokiteśvara’s transformation into the
                        principal figure of the Buddhist pantheon, greater than all other buddhas, let alone bodhisattvas. In this
                        sūtra, Avalokiteśvara is a resident of Sukhavātī and acts as a messenger and gift bearer for Amitābha,
                        even though he is also described as superior to all buddhas and therefore paradoxically has both a
                        subservient and dominant status. </p>

                    <p tid="6"> The appearance in writing of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāraṇḍavyūha </title>probably dates to
                        around the fifth century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. In terms of place, the text indicates familiarity with the cesspits of
                        Vārāṇasī, and assumes the reader’s knowledge of Candradvīpa, the southern part of Bengal where the Ganges
                        Delta is situated. In the Tibetan version, the merchants who wish to sail to Laṅka ask whether the winds
                        are blowing toward the land of the Greeks. This appears to locate their port of departure on the northwest
                        coast of India. In terms of time, the text is located within a culture where the Mahābhārata and the
                        Purāṇas had a dominant place in Indian culture, particularly the Skandha Pūraṇa, probably during the Gupta
                        period of the third to fifth century.</p>

                    <p tid="7">The earliest surviving manuscript is comprised of fragmentary pages from two manuscripts discovered
                        within a Gilgit stūpa in the 1940s. It was written in a hybrid of Middle Indic and Sanskrit, now called
                        Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, which was frequently used in sūtras. Adhelheid Mette, who has published these
                        fragments, suggests that it was composed in the fourth or fifth century;<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-051-004-499" index="1">Mette (2005).</note> the script in which it is written had fallen out of
                        use by the early seventh century, and the fragments show variations between the two manuscripts that are
                        the result of the texts having gone through generations of copying. Other existing Sanskrit manuscripts
                        (see below) date from a century or more later than the ninth century Tibetan translation.</p>

                            (1999).</note> in 270 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi> Dharmarakṣa of Dunhuang translated the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāraṇḍavyūha</title> into Chinese. Then, between 435 and 443 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, Gunabhadra translated it into
                        Chinese again. However, this is a case of misidentification. The sūtra they translated was the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratna­karaṇḍa­vyūha</title>. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāraṇḍavyūha
                        </title>itself was not translated into Chinese until 983 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, considerably later than the Tibetan

                        Avalokiteśvara’s qualities given in the sūtra is that he terrifies Vajrapāṇi! Vajrapāṇi would soon join
                        Mañjuśrī and Avalokiteśvara to form the principal trinity of bodhisattvas in the early tantra

                        The origin of the popular four-armed version of Avalokiteśvara appears within the sūtra as the goddess who
                        is the embodiment of the six-syllable mantra, referred to throughout as a <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vidyā</foreign> (which is a feminine noun) or often as <distinct>the queen of

The <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">karaṇḍa</foreign> is frequently portrayed in the background of portraits of Indian <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">siddhas</foreign> as a large pot-bellied basket with a lid, containing
                        collections of scriptures. These <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">siddhas</foreign> are also
                        portrayed making the hand gesture representing the basket, the <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">karaṇḍamudrā </foreign>(“basket gesture”). There is even a layperson’s hairstyle named <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">karaṇḍa­makuṭa </foreign>(“basket crest”), where the hair is arranged on
                        top of the head in the shape of a tall, rounded basket with a lid. </p>
                    <p tid="21">Another word for basket is <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">piṭaka</foreign>, which forms
                        the basis of the most common metaphor for the Buddha’s teachings, “the three baskets” or <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">tripiṭaka</foreign>, which contain the Vinaya, Sūtra, and the
                            Abhidharma or its predecessor the Mātṛkā. However, there are many instances in Tibetan
                        literature where <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">za ma tog</foreign>, the translation of <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">karaṇḍa</foreign>, means something more solid and smaller than a

                        Lhathothori. The name of the earlier <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratna­karaṇḍa­sūtra</title> could at first
                        seem to mean “precious casket,” but the contents of that sūtra validate the Tibetan translation as <title xml:lang="en">The Basket of the [Three] Jewels </title>(<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dkon mchog gi za ma

                        is more likely to be lost than added, as errors generally replace the uncommon with the common. The
                        enhanced vowel is used in Sanskrit to denote affiliation, origin, and ancestry. In the case of <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kāraṇḍa</foreign>, the word usually means “ducks”; they live among the

                        primarily because of the way <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">karaṇḍa</foreign> is used in the sūtra
                        itself. This term occurs only within the description of the Avīci hell. The Vaidya edition has <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">visphurad ratnakaraṇḍavat</foreign>, which means “raging [flame] like a

                        referring to the distinctive shape of the reed basket, wider at its middle. This shape is still associated

                        and even “chapter.” The sūtra is therefore a display from a basket, or the presentation of its

                        being described as the creator of its deities, including Śiva and Viṣṇu. In particular, Avalokiteśvara’s

                    <p tid="30">The sūtra itself is rarely read in Tibet, other than in the annual ritual chanting of the Kangyur,
                        and as mentioned above it has been eclipsed by the eleventh-century <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Maṇi
                            Kabum</title>. There is no evidence of it having had any significant impact on religious life in Tibet
                        in the preceding centuries. In spite of the eventual importance of the <foreign type="mantra" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ maṇipadme hūṁ </foreign>mantra, the sūtra is still primarily known only through
                        select quotations. One reason for this is that very little of the teaching and meditation practice of the
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Maṇi Kabum</title> is to be found in the sūtra. </p>

                    <p tid="31">Another reason is the difficulty involved in reading the sūtra due to its structure of narratives
                        within narratives. After a buddha is initially introduced, he is subsequently only referred to as
                        “Bhagavat,” and it is easy for readers to lose track of which level of the narrative they are reading.
                        Although the speakers’ names were not repeated in the original, we have added them in here for clarity. We
                        have not marked these insertions with square brackets, again for the sake of readability. </p>

                    <p tid="32">Another problem with the sūtra is that although it is a compilation of narratives, the sūtra does
                        not always use its source material in a skillful manner. The Sanskrit original itself does not compare
                        well with the clarity and style of writing found in other sūtras. There are abrupt transitions,
                        inconsistency in the use of pronouns, and the contents of one part of the narrative appear to be in
                        contradiction with those of another. For example, the Buddha tells the tale of the merchants being rescued
                        from the land of the rākṣasīs in the first person, but there are sporadic lapses into what must have been
                        the original third person of the narrative. The asura king Bali’s account of his downfall likewise
                        transitions from a first- to a third-person account. In common with many other Mahāyāna sūtras but perhaps
                        more frequently than most of them, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāraṇḍavyūha</title> refers to itself
                        within its own narrative as a sūtra that is being taught, requested, or longed for, but appears to
                        describe itself as being comprised of verses, almost as if the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāraṇḍavyūha</title> is a different sūtra that is simply being referred to in this sūtra. </p>

                    <p tid="33">The sūtra assumes that the reader is familiar with the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahābhārata
                        </title>and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Rāmāyaṇa</title>, the two great epics of Indian literature, and
                        the story of Viṣṇu’s avatar as a dwarf deceiving Bali, the lord of the asuras. Tibetan readers, however,
                        would be unfamiliar with personages referred to in passing in the text, such as Śukra, who is both the
                        deity of the planet Venus and counselor for the king of the asuras. Viṣṇu is usually referred to as
                        Nārāyaṇa in the sūtra, but in the passage where he rescues the Pāṇḍavas and other kṣatriyas of <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahābhārata</title> fame, he is referred to as Daśarathaputra (“son of Daśaratha”),
                        which is actually the name of Rāma, another of Viṣṇu’s avatars. This may be because the story of the dwarf
                        avatar also appears in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Rāmāyaṇa</title> when it is told to Rāma, that is,

                        omissions are particularly evident when there are lists of qualities or meditations that are more easily
                        left out in the process of copying manuscripts. On the other hand, there are also instances of members of

                        attracted scholarly attention, occurred on rendering the obscure term <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ratikara</foreign>, which literally means “that which creates joy,” and is also the
                        name of one of the apsarases that are in the audience for this sūtra. The later Nepalese version used
                        instead <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dvīpa</foreign>, the common word for “lamp,” but
                        both the Chinese and Tibetan translators, even with the assistance of Sanskrit scholars, were
                        understandably stumped by this odd word, particularly as the <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ratikara</foreign> laughs and speaks. Both Yeshé Dé and T’ien Hsi-tsai chose to make it refer to the

                        paramour. This entailed interpolating the word “sleeping” into the translation. However, the
                        result makes little narrative sense, whereas the unlikely meaning of lamp, which we therefore preferred

                        preserved in the Tibetan translation. The Degé edition and the version in the critical edition of the
                        Kangyur were therefore our principal sources. </p>
                    <p tid="40">Sanskrit manuscripts do not necessarily reflect the original form of a text, even though they are
                        in the original language, because they may have their own accretion of omissions and additions that have
                        occurred in the centuries following the time a Tibetan or Chinese translation was made. There has not yet
                        been a critical edition from all available Sanskrit manuscripts, but we consulted three Sanskrit editions,
                        the most important being a palm-leaf manuscript from the Cambridge University Library, which was written
                        in the beginning of the second millennium before the development of the Devanāgarī script. It is notable
                        for being closer to the Tibetan. Of easier access but less representative of the original text are the
                        Sāmaśrami edition of 1872 and the 1962 Vaidya edition that is based closely on Sāmaśrami. The Sāmaśrami is
                        available on the Online Sanskrit Texts Project of the Theosophical Network, and the Vaidya is openly
                        available on the internet. To complete the translation of some difficult passages, we also referred to the
                        Gilgit manuscript fragments, though they were not readily accessible. Silfung Chen’s online English
                        translation from the Chinese proved interesting in its correspondences with these editions. </p>

                    <p tid="41">Nevertheless, as noted above, there were a number of points where we relied on the Sanskrit to
                        fill in missing elements, words, members of a list, and sometimes whole sentences, although it is possible
                        that some of the latter may have been later additions to improve the flow and clarity of the sūtra’s
                        sometimes clumsy narrative. Where our translation favors the Sanskrit over the Tibetan, annotations
                        indicate that this is the case. </p>
                    <p tid="42">An important objective was readability, so the syntax does not necessarily reflect that of the
                        Tibetan or Sanskrit versions. For example, an active construction may be used instead of a passive
                        construction found in the original. The inconsistencies of first and third person have been resolved, and,
                        as noted above, names are repeated when otherwise the reader might lose track of who is speaking or to
                        whom the text is referring. Hopefully this will make reading the sūtra in English far less challenging
                        than attempting to do so in Tibetan or Sanskrit. Readers will find the variant readings in Tibetan and
                        Sanskrit in the notes if they wish. </p>

                        to teach the yakṣas and rākṣasas about the merit that comes from this sūtra.</p>

                        and food that he then offers to the brahmin. Avalokiteśvara in the form of the brahmin tells the deva that

                            Otherwise it could seem to be the description of a conclusion of a section of the book. The uncommon

Neither the Cambridge manuscript nor the

                            here and elsewhere a number of additional divisions into chapters, which they call <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prakaraṇa</foreign>. The text from which the Chinese translation was

                            Avalokiteśvara’s toe. This strange final sentence of the Maheśvara episode, therefore, in which the

                                an important status during the Buddha’s lifetime and only developed his own significant following
                                in the early years of the common era. Vaishnavism developed the theory of ten emanations, or
                                avatars, the ninth being the Buddha. His emanation as a dwarf plays an important role in this
                                sūtra. The Sanskrit etymology of the name is uncertain, but it was already in use in the Vedas,
                                where he is a minor deity, and has been glossed as “one who enters (everywhere).” </term>
