                <p tid="1">The Buddha’s disciple, the monk Pūrṇa, oversees
                    the construction of a temple dedicated to the Buddha in a distant southern 
                    city. When the master builder suggests that the building may be used by others 
                    in the Buddha’s absence, Pūrṇa argues that no one but an omniscient buddha may rightly
                    take up residence there. Enumerating the kinds of knowledge that are unique to a buddha’s
                    perfect awakening, Pūrṇa then delivers a lengthy exposition that also relates each of
                    these qualities to the knowledge of the four truths. Following Pūrṇa’s teaching, 
                    the master builder invites the Buddha and his followers from afar to the inauguration 
                    of the newly built structure. They arrive, flying through the sky. After the inauguration, 
                    the Buddha pauses with his monks on the shores of the ocean, where he receives the worship 
                    of numerous nāga kings, teaches and inspires them, and predicts their awakening. At 
                    Maudgalyāyana’s request, the Buddha then recounts each of the specific
                    events in his past lives that ultimately led to the unfolding of each of his
                    particular kinds of knowledge.</p>

                <p tid="2">This long sūtra thus serves as a detailed guide to the different aspects of 
                    the Buddha’s awakened wisdom, particularly those that, in many accounts 
                    of the qualities of buddhahood, are known as the ten powers or strengths. </p>

                            the Blessed One’s Extensive Wisdom That Leads to Infinite 
                            Certainty</title>,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-047-001-5" index="1">We 
                                have translated the title of this text based on the 
                                Tibetan (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bcom ldan ’das kyi ye shes rgyas 
                                    pa’i mdo sde rin po che mtha’ yas
                                pa mthar phyin pa</title>) while considering the Sanskrit title
                            provided in the Tibetan manuscripts. In the process we have attempted
                            our own emendation of the Sanskrit title, which we believe is the
                            product of a back-translation from the Tibetan. The revised Sanskrit
                            title that we suggest using for this text is: <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ananta­niṣṭhāga­bhagavajjñāna­vaipulya­sūtra­ratna</title>. In
                            arriving at this title, we have been guided by the following
                            reflections: The Tōhoku catalog lists the title, which its compilers
                            likewise attempted to revise, as <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">niṣṭhāgata­bhagavajjñāna­vaipulya­sūtra­ratnānanta</title>.
                            However, the Tōhoku title includes a footnote for <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāgata</foreign> that mentions an
                            alternative reading of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāgan</foreign>. This has led us to believe that the original
                            reading most probably was <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāga</foreign>, and not <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāgata</foreign>, since the meaning of this term is better
                            suited in this context (see further below). The difference in meaning
                            between these two terms is that <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāgata</foreign> means “arrived at certainty” (i.e.,
                            “conclusive / definitive”), whereas <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāga</foreign> can also mean “leading to certainty.”
                                The Sanskrit title given on the title page of the Degé Kangyur reads
                                <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">niṣṭhatan-bhagavat-jñāna-vaipulyan-sūtra-ratna-ānanta</title>.
                                Other Kangyurs reflect variants, although most of them are minor. Most
                                notably, a few Kangyurs (e.g. the Stok Palace as representative of the
                            Thempangma line) are missing <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ānanta</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mtha’ yas pa</foreign>). Also, although the correct form might be
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāga(ta)</foreign>, all
                            of the Tibetan editions that we consulted read <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhatan</foreign> (although <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ā &gt; a</foreign> is common and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ga</foreign> could have been elided in
                            copying). Most importantly, however, they all place this term at the
                            beginning of the title, and not at the end, where it appears in the
                            Tibetan. Given this introductory placement of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāga</foreign> in the Sanskrit title, we believe
                            that so also should <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ananta</foreign> be moved to the beginning of the title as a
                            qualifier of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāga</foreign>.
                                One could of course adopt the reading of the Stok Palace Kangyur where
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ananta</foreign> / <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mtha’ yas pa</foreign> is missing
                            altogether, which would also yield a straightforward title. However, by
                            moving <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ananta</foreign> to the
                            beginning of the title (and thus conforming to the Tibetan where
                                <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mtha’ yas pa</foreign> and
                                <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mthar phyin pa</foreign> are
                            placed next to each other in that sequence) one gets the compound
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">anantaniṣṭhāga</foreign> ,
                            which we believe is the better option. The phrase <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">anantaniṣṭhā</foreign> (or its synonym
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">atyantaniṣṭhā</foreign> )
                            actually occurs in other Buddhist texts, including the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Lalitavistara</title>, where, in a description of
                            the Dharma wheel, we find the sentence <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">akopyaṃ taccakram atyanta­niṣṭha­tvāt</foreign>,
                            meaning, “This wheel cannot be shaken, because of the infinite certitude
                            [of the Dharma].” As such, it is also <term type="ignore">possible</term> that the original Sanskrit might have read <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">atyanta­niṣṭhāga</foreign> rather than
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">anantaniṣṭhāga</foreign>.
                            With this word order, the Sanskrit title becomes plausible and makes
                            sense, both in terms of grammar and meaning. Significantly, in this way
                            we also arrive at a Sanskrit title that can actually be read as a basis
                            for the Tibetan translation, which is a feature missing from the
                            Sanskrit as it is listed in the Tibetan manuscripts as well as the
                            Tōhoku catalog. Thus, with our proposed emendations to the Sanskrit
                            title, the Sanskrit and the Tibetan titles are reconciled. </note> is
                        one of the longer works in the Kangyur, filling no less than
                        five hundred fifty Tibetan pages in the Degé Kangyur. However, in spite of its 
                        impressive size, the
                        sūtra has remained virtually unread and unstudied in the West.

The explanation takes place first in a long teaching that focuses on how these qualities make the Buddha unique compared to any other spiritual teacher, and later in the text when the Buddha himself recounts the roots of merit in his past that have allowed them to unfold in his awakened state. </p>

                        in which a sandalwood residence or temple has been constructed for the Buddha in 
                        a distant region, supervised by the monk Pūrṇa, who delivers a teaching. 
                        The Buddha is invited from afar 
                        to visit the temple, and does so by flying there with a large entourage. The 
                        excitement of the event causes a commotion among the nāgas in the nearby ocean, 
                        to which the Buddha responds by visiting them, too, and then also delivering a 
                        teaching.</p>

                        to build a temple. Its narrative also supplies reasons why the building might have been reserved for the Buddha’s use alone—a notion that is echoed in this sūtra, but in the quite different form of a detailed discourse on some of the unique qualities that set the Buddha quite apart from anyone else.

                        several nāga kings, and (3) stories of the Buddha’s past lives. Although there 
                        are no formal chapter divisions in the Tibetan text, we have divided the

                        an extensive teaching addressed by Pūrṇa to the unnamed householder who 
                        is the temple’s master builder. From the householder’s opening statement,
                        he also seems to be the sponsor, or one of the sponsors, of the building

                            Pūrṇa himself is the main instigator and patron of the building 
                            project.</note> and he is at first concerned that
                        the building will be left empty during the times when the Buddha resides
                        elsewhere. Wishing to put his gift to good use, he suggests to Pūrṇa that
                        perhaps other spiritual seekers could live in the temple whenever the Buddha
                        is absent. In reply Pūrṇa explains why that would not be proper, since no
                        other spiritual teacher possesses qualities that would warrant their
                        occupying the omniscient one’s residence. To make his case, Pūrṇa now
                        delivers an extensive teaching (which continues for more than two hundred pages) on
                        the omniscient wisdom unique to the Buddha. Pūrṇa
                        lists all the kinds of knowledge that the Buddha possesses in a format that is loosely
                        structured around the often cited “ten powers of a buddha,” as well as 
                        the other awakened insights of a buddha,
                        such as his fearlessness and correct understanding. This teaching
                        is essentially an abhidharma exposition of awakened experience. </p>

                        above schema (though with several differences in the order), he also interrupts this structure with elaborations
                        on the individual powers, which he breaks up into further subsections. At
                        times, this results in extensive topical tangents in which numerous
                        subcategories of abhidharma theory—including not only the elements and senses,

                        his attempt to relate each of the ten powers in turn—and many of their

                        cessation, and path) individually. For each type of
                        knowledge unique to the fully awakened experience, we are told that the
                        Buddha knows how it relates specifically to the knowledge of each of the
                        four truths. The Buddha thus correctly knows how to employ every single
                        one of his awakened qualities to bring the limitless
                        beings under his sphere of influence to their own awakening. </p>

                        repetition, with only minor variations as the text progresses
                        through the various lists of the Buddha’s awakened qualities and their
                        relationship to the four truths. This rather stringent and repetitive
                        language is of course reflected in the translation.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-047-001-24" index="10"> To further complicate matters,
                            the recurring phrase that Pūrṇa uses to describe how the ten powers and
                            their subdivisions relate to the Buddha’s knowledge of the four truths
                            is not entirely straightforward. The Tibetan—the structure of which is
                            repeated throughout the text—reads (we have here used “X” to mark the
                            changing topics): <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">de bzhin

                            as follows: “The Thus-Gone One correctly understands the knowledge of X.
                            He correctly understands the knowledge of the <term type="ignore">origin</term> 
                            as related to knowledge of X. He correctly
                            understands the knowledge of cessation as related to knowledge of X. He
                            correctly understands the knowledge of the path that leads to cessation
                            as related to knowledge of X.” As we read these sentences, we take
                                “<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">X shes pa</foreign>” to be
                            the object of the Buddha’s understanding of the knowledge of the
                            individual truths.</note> To a contemporary audience, such continuous
                        repetition may seem awkward and tedious, and even counterproductive
                        to religious inspiration. However, it is important to remember that in the
                        Indian Buddhist culture in which the sūtra emerged, sacred texts fulfilled
                        functions quite different from those of contemporary literature, which is largely
                        secular. Extensive repetition of key passages is integral
                        to a number of Buddhist scriptures, serving important mnemonic purposes and perhaps
                        therapeutic ones, too.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-047-001-25" index="11"> In

                            reproducing such repetitive passages (which he finds “paralysingly
                            boring”) on the grounds that such repetition is unlikely to yield
                            significant insights in readers (Griffiths 1981, p. 25). While Griffiths
                            is no doubt right that modern readers may find such extensive
                            repetition difficult to digest and hard to appreciate in terms of
                            literary value, it nevertheless seems important to present texts like this in 
                            their totality to allow readers of all kinds, specialist or not, to appreciate

                        of one of the nāga kings and Maudgalyāyana, recounts the
                        times in his past lives when specific spiritual trainings and
                        religious activities led to his developing the insights that have now fully
                        manifested in the form of his awakened knowledge. In a series of stories
                        from his past, we are introduced to the individual events that produced

Mistaken views are classified and enumerated in many different ways in different texts, but this enumeration of sixty-two mistaken views is probably derived from the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Brahmājāla Sūtra</title>, and is also found in the Prajñāpāramitā texts and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Lotus Sūtra</title>.</note> Subsequently, the

                            is called ‘Vision of One Thousand Lotuses,’ he knows the names for each

                        so far beyond even the most accomplished of other human beings as to represent an entirely
                        different order—is an important one, and we are pleased to make it available for the first time to readers in English. </p>

No place whose name has this exact Tibetan rendering is found elsewhere in the canonical texts, and it has no attested Sanskrit equivalent. There is, however, a very close match in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Gaṇḍavyūha</title> (Degé Kangyur, vol. 38, phal chen, a, F.65.b; see also Roberts, forthcoming): <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dge ba’i pha rol tu phyin pa</foreign>, Śubhapāraṃgama in Sanskrit, the southern city where the householder bodhisattva Veṣṭhila lives—although this may well be an allegorical rather than a geographical name. Intriguingly, Veṣṭhila worships at a sandalwood shrine. Whatever the case, the stated location in the present text differs from that of the temple in <title xml:lang="en">The Deeds of Pūrṇa</title>, which is built in the coastal city Sūrpāraka (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">slo ma lta bu</foreign>)—the capital of Aparānta and Pūrṇa’s native city, identified with modern Sopara, just to the north of Mumbai.</note> there was a householder,

Both spellings are found in other texts in all Kangyurs, and appear to represent alternative spellings of the same term. Csoma de Körös (p. 426) and Henri Léon Feer (p. 231) both rendered <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phywa mkhan</foreign> as “fortune teller,” a sense it may have in some contexts (although in such cases “diviner” might be a better rendering). However, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­vyutpatti</title> (3770) lists <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phya mkhan</foreign> as the Sanskrit <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">stha­pati</foreign>, which Monier Williams translates as “chief, governor, architect, master builder,
                            etc.” This seems the more likely sense given the context, and in a number of Vinaya and Prajñāpāramitā texts in the Kangyur the term (in both spellings) clearly has that meaning.</note> who had engaged venerable Pūrṇa to oversee the

                    <p tid="17">At that point, the householder master builder said to venerable
                        Pūrṇa, “Pūrṇa, although this temple has been made exclusively for the

The relationship between the master builder and Pūrṇa is not made fully clear, but the story differs in this respect from that of <title xml:lang="en">The Deeds of Pūrṇa</title>, in which Pūrṇa is the instigator of the building project and pays for it with the proceeds of his brother’s expedition (which is also the source of the sandalwood).</note>

                        understands the knowledge of the eye element. Householder, this is how the
                        Thus-Gone One correctly understands it. The eye is the ripening of subtle
                        matter derived from the primary elements conjoined with mind. Within the
                        eye, forms are perceived. Forms obstruct the eye, and it obstructs forms.
                        The eye has seen, it sees, and it will see forms. In order to perceive form,
                        the eye is always undifferentiated. The eye is also included within the
                        eighteen elements as the eye element. Among the twelve sense sources it is
                        the eye sense source. Among the twenty-two faculties it is the eye faculty.
                        That is the eye. It is the eye element; it is the eye sense source; it is
                        the eye faculty. <ref cRef="F.20.b"/> It is a gateway. It is white. It is a
                        stream, a lake, an ocean. It is an expanse. It is light. It is a water
                        source. It is a leader. It is a guide. It is a foundation. It is internal.
                        It is secret. It is a field. It is not transcendent. It is the vessel of the
                        demons. It engages with the entities of the self. It enters the empty city.
                        It is to be known in full. It is to be known completely. It is to be
                        abandoned. It is known as the eye element. To know, see, perceive, realize,
                        understand, and be skillful about this is called <distinct>knowing the eye
                            element</distinct>, and that is what the Thus-Gone One correctly

                        sounds. The ear has heard, it hears, and it will hear sounds. In order to
                        perceive sounds, the ear is always undifferentiated. The ear is also
                        included within the eighteen elements as the ear element. Among the twelve

                        order to perceive smells, the nose is undifferentiated. The nose is also

                        the Thus-Gone One correctly understands it. The tongue is the ripening of
                        subtle matter derived from the primary elements conjoined with mind. On the
                        sense source of the tongue, tastes are perceived. The tongue is obstructed
                        by taste, but it also obstructs taste. The tongue has tasted, it tastes, and
                        it will taste. In order to perceive taste, the tongue is always
                        undifferentiated. The tongue is also included within the eighteen elements
                        as the tongue element. Among the twelve sense sources it is the tongue sense

                        tongue; it is the tongue element; it is the tongue sense source. <ref cRef="F.30.b"/> It is the tongue faculty. It is a gateway. It is white.
                        It is a stream, a lake, an ocean. It is an expanse. It is light. It is a
                        water source. It is a leader. It is a guide. It is a field. It is an entity.
                        It is internal. It is secret. It is not transcendent. It is the vessel of
                        the demons. It engages with the entities of the self. It enters the empty
                        city. It is to be known in full. It is to be known completely. It is to be
                        abandoned. That is what is known as the tongue element. To know, see,

                        Thus-Gone One correctly understands it. The body is the ripening of subtle
                        matter derived from the primary elements conjoined with mind. It perceives
                        texture, and obstructs texture. The body obstructs texture, and it is also
                        obstructed by texture. The body has touched, touches, and will touch. In
                        order to perceive texture, the body is always undifferentiated. The body is
                        also included within the eighteen elements as the body element. Among the

                        is a water source. It is a leader. It is a guide. It is a field. It is a

                        permanence. Why are they wrong? Because a phenomenon that is disrupted would
                        be nothing whatsoever, and a phenomenon that passes from one life to the
                        next cannot be observed. In fact, however, birth occurs due to the

                        come together, they lead to the continuity of saṃsāra. When there are
                        disturbing emotions, karma is formed. When there is karma, there is the
                        formation of karmic ripening, but this individual experience is not created
                        by anyone. Rather, it is simply formed when such circumstances come
                        together. When a child is deaf, an ordinary person may think, ‘I have

                    <p tid="869">“Maudgalyāyana, in the past when I was training as a bodhisattva, I
                        underwent many hardships in order to understand the future. <ref cRef="F.135.b"/> While doing so, I thought, ‘By facing these hardships
                        may I in the future gain insight into unobscured wisdom.’ Long ago in
                        the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, in the distant past there
                        appeared in the world a thus-gone one named Luminous Wisdom Lamp. The thus-gone
                        Luminous Wisdom Lamp had a following of one hundred thousand hearers. Once
                        when he was teaching his hearers on the topic of the future there was in the
                        audience a monk named Always Diligent, who thought to himself, ‘How amazing!
                        In the future may I attain insight into unobscured wisdom!’ With that
                        thought in mind he tossed a large golden flower toward the thus-gone
                        Luminous Wisdom Lamp, and made a prayer: ‘How amazing—in the future may this
                        wisdom dawn in me!’ Due to that root of virtue I achieved knowledge of the
                        future. Also due to that root of virtue I came to understand dependent
                        origination. Furthermore, due to that root of virtue I achieved knowledge of
                        the <term type="ignore">origin</term> as related to knowledge of the future.
                        In general, if the causes and conditions are present, one will accomplish
                        knowledge of the <term type="ignore">origin</term> as related to knowledge
                        of the future, while such understanding will not come about if those causes
                        are absent. Due to such roots of virtue, I achieved knowledge of cessation
                        as related to knowledge of the future. With great delight I taught the
                        bodhisattva great beings, and due to the roots of virtue from such gladness
                        and utterly pure discipline, I achieved knowledge of the path leading to

                    <p tid="870">“Furthermore, Maudgalyāyana, I also created numerous roots of
                        virtue in order to achieve knowledge of the present. Long ago in limitless
                        cyclic existence, Maudgalyāyana, in the distant past there appeared in the
                        world a thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha named Limitless Sight; he was
                        learned and venerable, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman
                        who guided beings, unexcelled, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, a
                        blessed one. Once he was teaching on the topic of the present while
                        surrounded and revered by a retinue numbering into the hundreds of
                        thousands. <ref cRef="F.136.a"/> Among those present at the time was a
                        brahmin named Buddhimat, who was similar to a great sal tree. The brahmin
                        Buddhimat, who was similar to a great sal tree, heard the Blessed One teach
                        the Dharma with unlimited eloquence on the topic of the present. Moreover,
                        upon hearing it he felt unfathomable wonder at being in the Thus-Gone One’s
                        presence, and thought to himself, ‘It is amazing how the Thus-Gone One
                        teaches the Dharma with such unhindered eloquence on the topic of the
                        present. How marvelous!’ Feeling such wonder to be in the Thus-Gone One’s
                        presence, he tossed a flower made of a precious substance toward the
                        Thus-Gone One and made a prayer: ‘How amazing! May I fully awaken to
                        unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, and thereby teach the Dharma to achieve
                        such unhindered eloquence!’ Due to the ripening of that action, he did not
                        fall into degeneration for eight hundred million eons. Maudgalyāyana, in
                        case you may think that at that time the householder of the brahmin caste
                        named Buddhimat, who was similar to a great sal tree, was anyone else, do
                        not think so. In those days the householder of the brahmin caste name
                        Buddhimat, similar to a great sal tree, was me. Due to that root of virtue I
                        developed unhindered wisdom with regard to the present. I also inspired many
                        beings toward knowledge of the present, thereby creating roots of virtue
                        that led me to accomplish knowledge of the <term type="ignore">origin</term>
                        as related to knowledge of the present. Moreover, I actualized knowledge of
                        the present and then taught it genuinely, so that many other beings
                        actualized it as well. Due to the roots of virtue that came from that, I
                        actualized the knowledge of cessation as related to knowledge of the
                        present. </p>

                        involved in desire toward tastes is the idea of the unpleasant. The remedy

                        the remedies for beings no matter what they are involved with. Furthermore,
                        Viśākhamitra, there is a path, and practice related to that path, that

                        this knowledge, I served trillions of buddhas in the past. In doing so, I
                        created roots of virtue, and due to those roots of virtue I achieved

                        help in the past and ruin the help they’ve been given. Consider this story I
                        heard. A man was traveling through a forest when dark clouds formed. Lacking
                        any protection or shelter, a bear saved him and took him into his den. There
                        they survived on fruits and roots for seven days. Thinking the man must be
                        suffering from the cold, the bear cradled the man in his arms. After the
                        seven days passed and the storm cleared, they emerged from the den and the
                        bear sent the man off. However, the man disregarded the help that was given
                        to him and led a hunter to the bear so that it was killed. <ref cRef="F.139.a"/> In this way ungratefulness brings suffering in the
                        world. This shows the many different types of suffering.’</p>

                        harm the world, things that harm sentient beings and bring them suffering.

                        sickness, and the harm that comes from dying. These three things affect all
                        beings living in the world, including demons and even including Brahmā. And

                        was Devadatta. He became disturbed from using language that was inopportune
                        and inappropriate. The <term type="ignore">origin</term> of the happiness I
                        feel lies in the fact that at that time I spoke opportunely and
                        appropriately. The cause that led to the karmic ripening by which Devadatta
                        undergoes so much suffering lies in the inopportune and inappropriate
                        language he uttered.</p>

                        distant past there was a teacher known as Practicing Detachment. He was
                        someone who led sentient beings to freedom and emancipation from the harm of
                        sense pleasures and regarded that state as pure. He led numerous beings to
                        that state and when they became detached from sense pleasures, he would
                        assert that in that moment they had reached nirvāṇa. Thus he was able to
                        establish many of them fully in detachment from sense pleasures. A number of
                        them would then have the idea, ‘I am now perfectly detached from sense
                        pleasures.’ When beings had become detached from sense pleasures, they were
                        told they had achieved nirvāṇa, and that they would never take on a physical
                        form again. He established eighty million beings in this state of
                        acceptance, and they all thought they were liberated. In such a frame of
                        mind, after they died they were reborn in the realm of Brahmā. Witnessing
                        that happen, they concluded, ‘This so-called nirvāṇa is a perverted
                        doctrine. The path leading to this so-called nirvāṇa is a perverted path.
                        Any mendicants or brahmins who espouse such a doctrine of nirvāṇa are
                        preaching falsehoods.’ In fact, after they were born there, although they
                        did see Brahmā’s celestial palace, it immediately vanished and they instead
                        became beings in the great hells. This shows that while other paths may
                        claim to lead directly to liberation, emancipation from sense pleasures is
                        not liberation. </p>

                        perceived sense pleasures to be fetters and so renounced them. He took
                        ordination and eventually achieved the first absorption level, with both
                        conception and discernment. Then he thought, ‘No matter what I direct my

                        achieved a non-conceptual state of meditation. Then he thought to himself,

                        is so tranquil and <term type="ignore">magnificent</term>. Without
                        conception or discernment there is no need to continue to reincarnate—there

                        in the realm without remainder.’ Emerging from his state of absorption, he
                        went on to establish six hundred thousand beings in the same state of
                        acceptance. Each of them also thought, ‘Now that I am rid of conception and
                        discernment, there will be no more rebirth. With no need to continue taking
                        rebirth, I have achieved nirvāṇa.’ So pleased with their state of acceptance
                        and experiences, luminous celestial palaces manifested before them.
                        Beholding those palaces, however, they had the thought, ‘This so-called
                        nirvāṇa is a fallacy. Those mendicants and brahmins who preach about nirvāṇa
                        are misguided. Why? Because there cannot be a celestial palace in the state
                        of nirvāṇa.’ In fact, as soon as they beheld them, the celestial palaces
                        disappeared, and they fell into the great hell realms. </p>

                    <p tid="1041"> “Maudgalyāyana, I have explained how to understand and recognize
                        that afflictions lead to the appropriation of karma, just as I have
                        explained how the end of defilements is not understood or perceived. How is
                        this cognized and perceived, you may ask? Through correct mental engagement
                        and incorrect mental engagement. What is incorrect mental engagement? It
                        refers to the three ways of darkness. What is correct then? The three
                        gateways to liberation: emptiness, absence of marks, and absence of wishes.
                        Once one has a basis in emptiness, there is no longer any doubt or
                        reservation about there being a self, something that is ‘mine,’ or something
                        that is permanent, stable, tranquil, or eternal. Once one has realized this
                        with certainty, one overcomes any darkness and confusion regarding the
                        absence of self and something being ‘mine,’ just as daylight eliminates
                        darkness. Similarly, once one has certainty about emptiness, one will no
                        longer be threatened by the darkness. This is how the Blessed One gains
                        knowledge, and how the Thus-Gone One’s ten powers are revealed. This can be
                        said about knowledge of what is possible, knowledge of the <term type="ignore">origin</term> as related to knowledge of what is possible,

                        the seven royal treasures. From a sage named Intense Splendor, who possessed
                        the five superknowledges, he learned that those who kill follow a course to
                        the lower realms, that those who forsake killing follow a course to the
                        higher realms, and that those who bring an end to the afflictions follow a

                        ‘What are the causes of the knowledge of the paths that lead to all
                        destinations?’ Thinking further, he realized, ‘The causes that create the
                        paths that lead to all destinations lie in the formation of karma. But what
                        are the causes that lead to the formation of karma? The causes that lead to
                        the formation of karma are the afflictions of desire, anger, and ignorance.
                        But what are the causes of desire, anger, and ignorance? The causes leading
                        to karma and the afflictions lie in distorted mental engagement. <ref cRef="F.154.a"/> Distorted mental engagement produces afflictions, which
                        in turn lead to the formation of physical, verbal, and mental karma.
                        Prompted by distorted mental engagement, the six sense faculties are formed,
                        on the basis of which more afflictions come about. Then again afflictions
                        lead to the formation of karma, and that karma ripens into further formation
                        of the six sense faculties. This immense amount of past suffering is what is
                        not understood. What have sentient beings failed in and what is it they do
                        not correctly understand? What knowledge will lead to the end of suffering
                        and how can it be achieved?’ To this he told himself, ‘One who has no
                        afflictions will understand correctly. Without afflictions then, no karma
                        will be created. When no karma is created, the six sense faculties will not
                        be formed. When no karma is created, that is nirvāṇa. To be distorted is
                        cyclic existence, while to be undistorted is nirvāṇa. What is undertaken by
                        distortion is undone through being undistorted. By distortion one revolves
                        in the wheel of cyclic existence, while by being undistorted one turns the
                        wheel of Dharma. One is bound by distortion and freed by being undistorted.
                        Whoever understands this becomes free from the paths of cyclic existence,
                        eradicates their associated suffering, and achieves the path of
                        nirvāṇa.’</p>

                        realize the paths that lead to all destinations, and in their perception I
                        make them train on the path to nirvāṇa. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana,

                        roots of virtue in order to gain knowledge of the <term type="ignore">origin</term> as related to knowledge of the paths that lead to all
                        destinations. Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long
                        before even the distant past there appeared in the world one named
                        Sandalwood Heir who had served past victors, and who had limitless faith in
                        as well as limitless fondness for the Thus-Gone One. He saw that in order to
                        attain the buddhas’ wisdom, the paths that lead to all destinations must
                        cease. He thought to himself, ‘Complete awakening to buddhahood does not
                        take place through the knowledge of the noble ones, nor can it happen on the
                        basis of any other knowledge. What is the reason for this? It is because
                        such knowledge grasps to something as being real, whether that grasping is
                        to the path, or to nirvāṇa. Complete awakening to buddhahood can only take
                        place when there is no longer the slightest bit of grasping to anything as
                        real. Thus, one must not fixate on knowledge of the paths that lead to all
                        destinations. It is like the analogy of traveling in a boat: once you reach
                        the other shore, you leave the boat behind. In the same way, after attaining
                        complete awakening, you must leave behind the knowledge of the paths that
                        lead to all destinations. As we must, without clinging, regard all phenomena
                        as lacking a concrete essence, so too we must, without any observation, give
                        up knowledge of the paths that lead to all destinations. In this sense we
                        should regard the teachings as like a boat.’ <ref cRef="F.156.b"/>

                        a relative level is to achieve acceptance that phenomena are unborn.’

                        many worldly elements, and it is due to our attachment to the elements that
                        we experience suffering. Whenever there is an element, there is a need for
                        people’s material things; if there were no elements, there would be no need
                        for people’s material things. Since taking on elements in the past, though
                        we pursue material things, we just suffer more. Why should we suffer due to
                        the elements? If I continue to create this, I will only continue to suffer.’
                        Reflecting in this way, he gave up his kingdom and took ordination.
                        Developing in the four abodes of Brahmā, he then took rebirth in the realm
                        of Brahmā. Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time King
                        Bandhumat was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was King
                        Bandhumat. At that time I gave up the defects of the several elements. Since
                        I still now perceive the faults of the several elements, I am free from
                        appropriation. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should come to see the

                        before even the distant past there was a king named Brahmadeva who was both
                        wise and spiritually inclined. Once he wondered, ‘What is this self that
                        governs as the lord of humans? By which human name does the self govern as
                        the lord?’ He then concluded, ‘It must be the eighteen elements. What is the

                        of human beings?’ Concerning this he concluded, ‘They are created by karma,
                        which is itself of three types: the type born out of desire, the type born
                        out of anger, and the type born out of ignorance. Karma born out of desire
                        leads to the formation of the realms of five classes of beings: the hells,
                        the animal realm, the realm of the Lord of Death, the human world, and the
                        god realm. Karma born out of anger leads to <ref cRef="F.160.a"/> the

                        leads to the formation of the realms of five classes of beings: the hells,

                        god realm. How is this? Desire functions via five senses, while anger
                        functions via three, and ignorance functions via five. How, exactly? Any
                        locus of our desire is likewise a locus of ignorance. Anger is only a locus
                        of the lower realms. Thus, they are referred to as “the several

                        thinking that at that time Prince Kāruṇika was anyone else, do not think so.
                        In those days I was Prince Kāruṇika. For this reason, Maudgalyāyana,
                        bodhisattvas should gain knowledge of all treatises. Maudgalyāyana,
                        bodhisattvas who are knowledgeable about all treatises enter into the state
                        of omniscience. Why is this, Maudgalyāyana? It is because making a
                        composition about omniscient wisdom means to be knowledgeable about all
                        treatises. Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas who are knowledgeable about all
                        treatises come to take on the disposition of the authors of those treatises.
                        By this identity they teach the treatises. You should know that in this
                        regard the Thus-Gone One’s knowledge of the path that leads to cessation as
                        related to knowledge of the several elements refers to omniscience. Why is
                        this? Afflictions can be inferred from the presence of karma. Due to these
                        afflictions further karma is formed. Mind can be inferred from the presence
                        of the afflictions. Due to the presence of involvement in afflictions, one
                        can infer the presence of mind that is attached, angry, or deluded. Based on
                        the presence of mind one can infer the presence of the person. In this way
                        the Thus-Gone One declares sentient beings’ transmigrations. For instance,
                        ‘Because of creating this karma, this individual will transmigrate as a hell
                        being.’ Or, ‘Because of creating this karma, this individual will
                        transmigrate to be born as an animal.’ Or, ‘Because of creating this karma,
                        this individual will transmigrate to the realm of the Lord of Death.’ Or,
                        ‘Because of creating this karma, this individual will transmigrate into the
                        class of demigods.’ Or, ‘Because of creating this karma, this individual
                        will transmigrate as a human.’ Or, ‘Because of creating this karma, this
                        individual will transmigrate to the higher realms.’ <ref cRef="F.164.a"/>
                        Or, ‘Because of creating this karma, this individual will transmigrate to

                        be deduced based on the presence of karma; and in the same manner, a certain
                        karma will be created due to the presence of an affliction. It may arise

                        householder. With no household the grief of being a householder would be
                        gone. With having children come the troubles of having children. Without

                        Concept, who had extrasensory perception of all beings’ minds. He went from
                        town to city to village to kingdom to palace teaching his knowledge about
                        roots. At that time there was also a mendicant named Udāyī who had
                        cultivated all the roots of virtue. He heard that a root digger named Truly
                        Discerned Concept was teaching his knowledge of roots to large gatherings of
                        people. This made him think, ‘One should not teach in this way about worldly
                        knowledge, and yet I will go and learn this sort of worldly knowledge.’
                        Learning the knowledge of roots, he then went to a hermitage and sat in
                        solitude in his quarters, analyzing: ‘Where can I seek out worldly
                        knowledge?’ The thought then came to him: ‘I need not seek worldly knowledge
                        anywhere else than this very body.’ His contemplations continued: ‘What is
                        this world?’ And then the thought came to him: ‘This world is the five
                        aggregates, which arise, age, become ill, <ref cRef="F.171.b"/> and die.
                        In that sense they are fleeting, transient, transitory, and perishable. They
                        are unsteady, and prone to decay and decomposition. Whoever understands the
                        world with such knowledge will bring an end to the suffering of aging, bring
                        an end to the suffering of sickness, and bring an end to the suffering of
                        death.’ </p>

                        transient phenomena. I will liberate all these sentient beings from the
                        world.’ And setting himself to this, he achieved the five types of
                        superknowledge, and amused himself with his five types of superknowledge. He
                        then went on to teach them to others. By means of his five types of
                        superknowledge, he could see how sentient beings rush through the five

                        if you understand how all composite things truly are, you will see that they
                        are insubstantial. Composite things are in no way fixed. If you think they

                        Maudgalyāyana, to perceive things as clean brings bondage; to recognize them

                        as permanent brings bondage; to recognize them as impermanent brings
                        liberation. To perceive that there is a self brings bondage; to recognize
                        selflessness brings liberation. To perceive things as having characteristics
                        brings bondage; to recognize them as lacking characteristics brings

                        of a bodhisattva in the past, I created numerous different roots of virtue

                        Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a young lord
                        named Reliever of Suffering who had served previous victors. Once, he had
                        the thought, ‘I should come to fully understand knowledge of the <term type="ignore">origin</term> as related to knowledge of the world, and
                        then go on to teach about it.’ His thoughts then continued: ‘Which ascetic
                        or brahmin now lives in the world who accurately understands knowledge of
                        the <term type="ignore">origin</term> as related to knowledge of the world?
                        I will ask whomever that may be.’ At that time there had appeared in the
                        world a thus-gone one named Nectar Proclaimer; he was learned and venerable, a
                        blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman who guided beings,
                        unexcelled, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, a blessed one. The young
                        lord Reliever of Suffering then took birth in the buddha realm of the
                        thus-gone Nectar Proclaimer. <ref cRef="F.174.a"/> As soon as the young lord
                        Reliever of Suffering was born there, a benevolent god who was his long-term
                        friend manifested in midair, allowed his body to become visible, and then
                        spoke these verses to the compassionate young lord:</p>

                        before even the distant past there was a spiritually inclined king named
                        Radiant. He held the seven treasures: the precious wheel, the precious
                        elephant, the precious horse, the precious jewel, the precious queen, the
                        precious steward, and the precious minister. He also had one thousand sons,
                        all of whom were brave, heroic, and athletic, and able to conquer all
                        opposing forces. The king governed the entire earth by his religion and
                        without the use of violent force. At that time there was a thus-gone one named
                        Peaceful Action whose retinue included a gathering of innumerably many
                        ordained monks, a gathering of countless tens of thousands of laypeople, a
                        gathering of countless sextillions of gods, and a gathering of countless
                        sextillions of nāgas. In the thus-gone Peaceful Action’s buddha realm,
                        beings’ life spans were fixed like those in the northern continent of Kuru.
                            <ref cRef="F.176.b"/> However, their life span was not fixed at just one
                        thousand years—their lives were immeasurably long. They never died until
                        they reached the full extent of their life span. Once King Radiant went
                        before the blessed thus-gone Peaceful Action along with seven thousand
                        ministers and five thousand master builders. There he bowed his head at the
                        Blessed One’s feet and then sat off to the side. Likewise, the seven
                        thousand ministers bowed their heads at the blessed Thus-Gone One’s feet
                        before sitting off to one side. Then they asked this of the blessed thus-gone

                        before even the distant past there was a king named Viśvabhū. <ref cRef="F.177.b"/> King Viśvabhū had sixty-eight thousand queens, all of
                        whom had bodies like goddesses, were loving like mothers, caring like aunts,
                        and respectful like servants. Dwelling among such queens with qualities like
                        goddesses, King Viśvabhū was nonetheless free of desire and free of anything
                        negative and unvirtuous. He was intelligent and discerning and had come to

                        and bliss born of disengagement. Similarly, he reached the culmination of
                        everything up to the fourth level of concentration, in which he abided.
                        After dwelling in equanimity at the fourth level of concentration, he
                        eventually emerged from it, and had the insight, ‘Sentient beings pine after
                        the five sense pleasures; they are totally attached to their desires. They
                        engage in and carry out harmful actions, due to which they fall into the
                        lower states. Some of them create the karma for becoming hell beings, others
                        for becoming animals, others for entering the realm of the Lord of Death,
                        others the divine realms, and others the human realm but with short lives.
                        Some have a longer life, others face less harm. Some end up in a low class
                        while others end up in a noble class. Some have little charisma while others
                        have more charisma. Some have little wealth while others have more wealth.
                        Some are unintelligent while others are intelligent. Some exert themselves
                        in following the current, while others exert themselves in going against the
                        current.’ Then he had the thought, ‘These paths are in disharmony with the
                        goal. I must guide these beings onto the path of the completely awakened
                        ones.’ </p>

                        achieved the five types of superknowledge, he was compelled by compassion

                        region to region engaged in teaching the path of the ten virtuous actions

                        again reborn into the realm of Brahmā. There in the realm of Brahmā he led
                        one quintillion beings to the level of non-regression. When that realm came
                        to an end, he was again reborn among the luminous gods. While he dwelled
                        there, he led countless hundreds of billions of beings to the irreversible
                        stage, such that they dwelled where there was no one ever born who was
                        without the Dharma. Applying these hundreds of thousands of methods, after
                        he died in the realm of Brahmā, he migrated among the luminous gods, and
                        from there again to the realm of Brahmā. When on occasion he would appear in
                        the human realm, he would still possess the five types of superknowledge
                        even though there was no buddha present. When there was a buddha present, he
                        would serve as attendant to that blessed buddha. Accumulating such roots of
                        virtue, the blessed buddhas then led him to enter into equanimity, in which
                        he then remained. Whether there was pleasure or whether there was

                        peace, liberate those who are not liberated, invigorate those who need

                        He had given up royal affairs to ordain. Yet despite having ordained, his
                        senses were distracted by objects. He thought to himself, ‘Oh, how sad!
                        Having forsaken all objects and ordained, it is unfit and improper that my
                        senses are yet distracted. With my deluded senses so caught in the cage of
                        objects, I must apply concentration that is like space, and thereby develop
                        the great strength to defeat all opponents. If I am to do this, though, what
                        is the equipoise of bodhisattva great beings that is like space?’ Then King
                        Birth Seeker reflected, ‘All these phenomena are like space. <ref cRef="F.186.a"/> In the sense that there is nothing obstructing space,
                        all objects are similar to space. Non-conceptuality is unobstructed;
                        non-conceptuality is liberation. Conceptuality is a fetter, while
                        non-conceptuality is what cuts that fetter. So I will give up

                        the Great Vehicle. He had formed roots of virtue with countless quadrillions
                        of buddhas, though for some time his mind had not penetrated unsurpassed and
                        perfect awakening. <ref cRef="F.187.a"/> He abided genuinely by the

                        there were no sentient beings who had failed to produce the seeds of
                        awakening. As the thus-gone Proclaimer of Fame was carrying out his awakened

                        perfect awakening, and yet he had ended up unfree. Thus he lacked the
                        fortune to produce the roots of virtue for unsurpassed and perfect

                        Conduct, who reigned over numerous regions under the single umbrella of his
                        command. In that era there were six hundred million cities in this world,
                        which was sixty thousand leagues across. The towns, cities, and villages
                        being in close proximity, the domestic fowls of the cities and villages
                        would roam freely in the other towns. There lived King Utterly Stable
                        Conduct. There were no thieves, robbers, or barbarians, but plenty of people
                        of good morals. <ref cRef="F.190.a"/> There were many festivals. The world
                        was filled with merry people, and people who cultivated the Dharma were
                        plentiful. The word ‘evil’ was unknown anywhere, let alone actual evil
                        behavior. The environment was beautified by groves, parks, ponds, and pools,
                        like a divine garden. It was jubilant with the continuous, uninterrupted
                        songs of conches, clay and wooden drums, three-stringed lutes, lutes

                        divine trees and trees of incense, garlands, and silk, and there were trees
                        with desirable fruits. Noble beings lived there; there were no other beings
                        but noble beings. </p>

                        named Stainless Zenith; he was learned and venerable, a blissful one, a
                        knower of the world, a steersman who guided beings, unexcelled, a teacher of
                        gods and humans, a buddha, a blessed one. The thus-gone Stainless Zenith
                        would live for an unfathomably long time. The beings then were also jolly,
                        and had little attachment, anger, or stupidity. They were modest, decent,
                        and possessed the modesty achieved by noble beings. They also created karma
                        primarily with reference to the thus-gone Stainless Zenith. There the
                        thus-gone Stainless Zenith lived and was honored. The pleasant sounds of
                        reverence and worship reverberated, and it became widely reported how noble
                        beings had gathered there. The thus-gone Stainless Zenith’s buddha realm
                        contained inexpressibly many worlds. Within them, the thus-gone Stainless
                        Zenith carried out his acts from town to town, city to city, and village to
                        village. <ref cRef="F.190.b"/> Wherever he went, when it came time for him
                        to depart again, there would be crying and weeping. Yet wherever he went
                        there was joy and he was regarded as an agreeable teacher. All the countless
                        quadrillions of sentient beings to whom he taught the Dharma became tamed.
                        He guided some of them with the vehicle of the hearers, some of them with
                        the vehicle of the solitary buddhas, and some of them with the unsurpassed
                        vehicle of the buddhas. When the thus-gone Stainless Zenith taught the
                        Dharma, speech endowed with eight qualities emerged from his mouth and his
                        voice contained the five hundred aspects of speech. Thus, as it emerged, it
                        was understood throughout the entire buddha realm. When the thus-gone
                        Stainless Zenith taught the Dharma, the entire buddha realm was sprinkled
                        with perfumed water. As the Thus-Gone One was manifesting his activity, when
                        the blessed thus-gone Stainless Zenith would teach the Dharma, the sounds of
                        divine instruments came from the sky. Whatever the beings there wished and
                        enjoyed to hear, they would hear as pleasing, beautiful, and jubilant
                        utterances, which they relished. Whatever utterances they enjoyed or
                        desired, they would hear those very sounds. If they desired the joy of
                        nirvāṇa, they happily experienced its bliss, free of anything unwholesome.
                        Those beings who desired the Dharma heard the words ‘impermanence,’
                        ‘suffering,’ ‘no-self,’ ‘peace,’ ‘nirvāṇa,’ ‘Buddha,’ ‘Dharma,’ and
                        ‘Saṅgha.’ They heard the words ‘recollection of the Buddha,’ ‘recollection
                        of the Dharma,’ ‘recollection of the Saṅgha,’ ‘recollection of discipline,’
                        ‘recollection of relinquishment,’ and ‘recollection of the deities.’ <ref cRef="F.191.a"/> As the Thus-Gone One’s activity came to fruition, cool
                        winds blew on those listening to the Dharma. A delight in hearing the Dharma
                        arose in all those whom that wind touched. When the Thus-Gone One taught the
                        Dharma, due to the stirring up of the wind brought about by Thus-Gone One,
                        none of the five obscurations occurred at all in any respect among those who
                        were seeking the Dharma. </p>

                        Śrīsambhava, who lived in the vicinity of the Thus-Gone One. He regarded the
                        Thus-Gone One’s retinue out of a wish to immerse himself in the Dharma. He
                        never said anything disturbing, agitated, or impure to anyone, and with a
                        sincere attitude he genuinely engendered a proper resolve. He thought, ‘Just

                        retinue, in the future may I become a Dharma teacher, perfecting all the

                        thoughts and emitted light. As that light struck the monk Śrīsambhava, he
                        immediately achieved the absorption of great compassion. Due to that
                        absorption, he became irreversible from unsurpassed and perfect

                        the four abodes of Brahmā. He also led all beings to engender the four

                        they cultivated the path leading to cessation as related to knowledge of

                        different roots of virtue in order to understand affliction. I did this by

                        before even the distant past there was a sage named Restrained Faculties. He
                        was not free from desire, but had taken hold of the faculties via
                        discernment, not through meditation. So that his faculties would not be
                        afflicted with respect to their objects, he wandered from one remote place
                        to another, from grove to grove, and from forest to forest. After a while he
                        happened to see a woman. Since he had been trying to restrain his faculties
                        but without meditating, as soon as he saw the woman, he was beset with
                        passionate desire. As that passionate desire welled up within him, he caught
                        himself, and then thought, ‘While I am restraining my senses by means of
                        analysis, it is not happening via discernment born of understanding.’ <ref cRef="F.196.b"/> He then thought, ‘I should seek the unafflicted wisdom
                        of the noble ones, the understanding by which I can restrain my senses.’
                        While he was then reflecting in this way, he had the following personal
                        insight: ‘The afflictive phenomena that arise in this way must be
                        understood. The afflictions that arise toward women must be understood. By
                        this type of analysis one does not apprehend afflictive phenomena, nor does
                        one apprehend the phenomena toward which one is afflicted.’ At that moment
                        he achieved freedom from attachment to the objects of desire. As he
                        understood affliction, there were no afflictive phenomena, nor any phenomena
                        toward which to be afflicted; by that wisdom of the noble ones he became
                        free of doubt. </p>

                        between gods and humans, that is to say, no one thought, ‘These are gods,
                        while these over here are humans.’ The huge multitude of beings comprising
                        the entourage became utterly quiet, such that there was not even the sound
                        of a single being clearing their throat. </p>

                        group had become and heard the silence, he thought, ‘Whatever sound does not
                        arise, does not cease. Whatever has ceased is also unborn.’ He continued to
                        reflect, ‘Thus if a sound does not arise, it does not cease. Since it is
                        non-existent, there is no thing that really ceases. <ref cRef="F.202.b"/>
                        Because there is no real existence, there is also no birth.’ He then
                        wondered, ‘What is the nature of these phenomena that arise?’ before the
                        insight came to him: ‘These arising phenomena of existence have no real
                        nature. They are unborn and unceasing.’ When in that moment he did not
                        apprehend any nature of phenomena, he achieved acceptance that phenomena are
                        unborn. Then, realizing that the bodhisattva called Non-Deficiency of Mind
                        had achieved acceptance that phenomena are unborn, the thus-gone Ambrosial
                        King gave his approval: ‘Wonderful! Noble son, how excellent that you
                        have come to understand phenomena correctly.’</p>

                        not think so. In those days I was the bodhisattva named Non-Deficiency of
                        Mind. Due to those roots of virtue, for seventy-six incalculable eons I did
                        not fall astray or become confused about the Dharma. I never had an
                        unwholesome state of mind, whether born of attachment, born of anger, or
                        born of stupidity. I constantly rested my mind within omniscience. Due to
                        such lucidity of mind, I was able to leave behind my habitual tendencies.
                        Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should discern the cessation of
                        phenomena; thus will habitual tendencies be overcome. </p>

                        purification. I did this by wondering, ‘How can I fully awaken to

                        was a thus-gone one named Vimalanetra; he was learned and venerable, a blissful
                        one, a knower of the world, a steersman who guided beings, unexcelled, a
                        teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, a blessed one. He was a Dharma teacher
                        whose instructions were good in the past, good in the middle, good in the

                        chaste. King Immaculate Consecration heard that the thus-gone Vimalanetra
                        was teaching the Dharma in his area, and that in the Thus-Gone One’s retinue
                        was a saṅgha of <term type="ignore">innumerable</term> monks. When he heard
                        this news, he thought, ‘The Thus-Gone One is wise, as he surely possesses
                        extraordinary wisdom. Since someone with a retinue as big as his must be in
                        harmony with the Dharma, no one will be able to repudiate him. I will go
                        before the thus-gone Vimalanetra, and ask him about knowledge of gathering
                        as related to knowledge of purification.’ </p>

                        hundred thousand wives. At that time the Thus-Gone One was teaching the
                        Dharma, while surrounded by countless tens of thousands of beings. The
                        audience was silent and listening attentively with their ears perked, with
                        all sentient beings in mind. Not even the sound of someone clearing their

                            <ref cRef="F.203.b"/> Merely beholding the Thus-Gone One, he noticed how

                        for the Thus-Gone One. He then reflected, ‘With such a large following, it

                        that point, eight hundred million gods from the Brahmā Realm manifested in
                        the sky above the Thus-Gone One, all of them with their palms together. They

                        Therefore, with respect to phenomena there is also no apparent existence for
                        hearers or solitary buddhas. Even the existence of bodhisattvas who have

                        Maudgalyāyana, they appear due to the power of such bodhisattvas’ roots of
                        virtue. Maudgalyāyana, in this realm, however, beings did not progress by
                        means of any roots of virtue. Still, the minds of those bodhisattvas would
                        constantly develop, without ever waning, throughout day and night. It is in

                        avail themselves of my treasury and find wealth.’ And with this thought in

                        Venerable ones, once in the past there was a sage by the name of Red Horse.
                        This sage set out on a journey thinking, “I shall travel to the end of the
                        world before I die.” When the sage walked, he stepped from one Sumeru
                        mountaintop to another, traveling with great speed, as when one travels
                        miraculously through mental <term type="ignore">powers</term>. Yet still he
                        died before reaching the end of the world. Venerable ones, the Blessed
                        Buddha does not tell us to reach the end of the world on foot. Rather, it is
                        due to wisdom that one reaches the end of the world. Venerable ones, if you
                        stay concerned about suffering then you will also be conceiving of suffering
                        in the future. Bodhisattva great beings journey to the end of the exhaustion
                        of craving. They do not think about reaching the end of the world. Such
                        beings are free from suffering and the notion of suffering.’</p>

                    <p tid="1491">“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long
                        before even the distant past, there was a captain named Loving All Beings
                        who had abundant possessions. This captain went to sea with a group of five
                        hundred merchants, yet when their ship was in the middle of the ocean it was
                        attacked by a sea monster. As the monster held the ship in its jaws the
                        merchants paid homage and cried out to whichever gods they had faith and
                        belief in. Thus they called out to Śiva, Skanda, Maheśvara, Indra,
                            <term>Varuṇa</term>, Prajāpati, Brahmā, <term>Kṣemaṅkara</term>, Sūrya,
                        or Candra. Some even paid homage to the ocean itself, and some again sat
                        speechless, thinking, ‘We have no protector of that sort—let us just die!’
                        Regardless, nobody came to anyone’s rescue. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-047-001-1434"/>
                    <p tid="1492">“The captain Loving All Beings thought to himself, ‘Alas, all
                        these merchants have relied on an inferior source of refuge. They have put
                        their hopes in a being who is neither a protector nor a refuge. In their
                        mistaken devotion they perceive that things have essences. Yet were I to
                        teach, I would not teach any essences to anyone.’ </p>
                    <p tid="1493">“Thus, Maudgalyāyana, when conditioned things are understood
                        correctly, as they are, one does not perceive any entities. There is no
                        certainty with respect to formations. If one wishes for purity one must give
                        up the marks of purity and instead rely on the marks of impurity. Similarly,
                        one must give up marks and rely on the absence of marks; that is the path of
                        liberation. Maudgalyāyana, for the sake of knowledge with an interest in
                        several elements I teach that permanence is bondage, and impermanence is
                        liberation; self is bondage, and absence of self is liberation; and marks
                            <ref cRef="F.215.b"/> are bondage, and absence of marks is liberation. </p>

                    <p tid="1494">“Maudgalyāyana, if a bodhisattva wishes to go beyond suffering,
                        and is concerned about bringing all sentient beings beyond suffering as
                        well, then that bodhisattva will display a pure appearance. Yet if one
                        conceives of impurity one will display an impure appearance. If one thinks
                        in terms of happiness, suffering, permanence, impermanence, self, absence of
                        self, marks, or absence of marks, one will display an appearance of the
                        absence of marks.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-047-001-1437" index="65">

                            unclear to us.</note> Maudgalyāyana, conceiving of purity is bondage,
                        thinking of impurity is liberation. Conceiving of happiness is bondage,
                        thinking of suffering is liberation. It is in this way that affliction
                        occurs. </p>

                        their distress. At that time a thus-gone one known as Conqueror of All Darkness
                        had appeared in the world. As soon as he had heard about him, the captain
                        had developed faith in that Thus-Gone One and now he told the merchants,
                        ‘Among all the saviors you believe in, there is not a single one who is a
                        source of refuge. So follow me! Take refuge in the one to whom I go for
                        refuge!’</p>

                        Pay homage and take refuge in him! Make up your minds completely and say,

                    <p tid="1498">“Stricken by terror in the face of death, the merchants became
                        entirely focused and cried, ‘Homage to the thus-gone Conqueror of All
                        Darkness!’ <ref cRef="F.216.a"/> As soon as the sea monster heard the name
                        of the Buddha it was pleased, and so it closed its mouth and let all the
                        merchants escape from their agony. </p>
                    <p tid="1499">“Maudgalyāyana, what do you think? In case you may think that, at
                        that time, the captain Loving All Beings was anyone else, do not think so.
                        And why not? Because in those days I was the captain Loving All Beings.
                        Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, the bodhisattva who wishes to perfectly comprehend
                        the several inclinations must endeavor to dispel any grasping at entity.</p>

                        bodhisattva in the past, I created numerous different roots of virtue in
                        order to understand the <term type="ignore">origin</term> as related to
                        knowledge of several inclinations. Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence,
                        Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past, there appeared in the
                        world a thus-gone one named Friend of Beings. Within the buddha realm of the
                        thus-gone Friend of Beings was a bodhisattva known as Nityodyukta. Rousing
                        diligence, this bodhisattva’s mind was undaunted, he had donned the great
                        armor, and had pure aspirations for <term type="ignore">innumerable</term>
                        buddha realms. He had pure aspirations for inconceivable, incomparable,
                        immeasurable, and inexpressible buddha realms. This bodhisattva asked
                        himself, ‘What are the causes and conditions for knowing the distinct and
                        numerous inclinations of sentient beings? What are the various inclinations
                        of sentient beings?’</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-047-001-1443"/>
                    <p tid="1501">“He then thought, ‘Sentient beings are concerned about, and take
                        delight in, whichever objects they rely on the most. Those are the objects
                        they are fond of and pursue. They concentrate on those objects to the extent
                        that they will be adverse to others. However, if that object disappears from
                        their experience, they instead become accustomed to another, which will <ref cRef="F.216.b"/> then replace the former object as their object of
                        concern. And so the process continues, as the inclinations shift from one
                        type of object to another. Sentient beings will thus pursue whichever object
                        they currently find rewarding and they will be hostile toward whichever
                        object they deem flawed. One should therefore not become obsessed with the
                        qualities of any object, nor should one develop aggression toward any object
                        one may hold to be flawed. Instead, one should discern the objects and then
                        remain neutral.’ In this way the bodhisattva Nityodyukta would neither crave
                        for desirable objects nor be averse to faulty ones. Instead he would
                        discern objects and remain neutral. In doing so, his achievement of the
                        qualities of the bodhisattvas became irreversible.</p>

                        bodhisattva Nityodyukta was anyone else, do not think so. Because in those
                        days the thus-gone Dīpaṃkara was the bodhisattva Nityodyukta. Therefore,
                        Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should give up concern for all objects and
                        instead be concerned with the transcendence of suffering. That is the

                        of ravishingly beautiful women. Likewise, when I was inclined toward sounds,
                        I would present all sorts of musical offerings to the memorials of the
                        thus-gone ones, and still that was not enough for me. When I was inclined
                        toward scents, I would produce abundant fragrances, and still that was not
                        enough for me. When I was inclined toward taste, I would produce many
                        different grains and a wide variety of dishes, and still that was not enough
                        for me. When I was inclined toward texture, I would receive a wide array of

                        This brahmin was like a great sal tree, a master of all the sciences, and a
                        great donor and benefactor, both in terms of Dharma and material things. He
                        endeavored to realize the omniscient mind. </p>

                    <p tid="1564">“At that time there was a thus-gone known as Stainless Teacher.
                        His lifespan was boundless, and his saṅgha of hearers, his buddha realm, and
                        his assembly of hearers were all immense. The brahmin Famous Sound, who was
                        like a great sal tree, had heard of the thus-gone Stainless Teacher, and so
                        he went before him together with nine hundred eighty million other brahmins.
                        Once there, they presented offerings to the blessed thus-gone Stainless
                        Teacher. In the sky above they unfolded a bejeweled canopy and on the ground
                        below they spread a golden floor. They then ornamented the ten directions
                        with eighty thousand golden mansions, each a league tall. Within each one of
                        them resided thousands of ladies richly adorned with jewelry, and from each
                        of the buildings came the melodious sounds of thousands of cymbals. On the
                        ground bloomed flowers of five colors, divine perfumes filled the air, and
                        the mansions were fragrant and delightfully scented with divine incense.
                        Thus, all the mansions were pleasant and delightful due to the scent of
                        incense and perfume. By the power of the Buddha, all the mansions rested in
                        midair without being otherwise supported. From all of them came the sounds
                        of praises to the Buddha, Dharma, <ref cRef="F.224.a"/> and Saṅgha. Likewise,
                        each of the houses resounded with words of emptiness, absence of marks, and
                        absence of wishes; of the fruitions of the stream-enterer, once-returner,
                        and non-returner; of impermanence, suffering, and the absence of self; of
                        concentrations, freedoms, absorptions, and equilibriums; of miraculous <term type="ignore">powers</term>, the divine eye, the divine ear, knowledge
                        of the minds of others, and knowledge of past situations and of cessation.
                        In some places one would hear words that accord with liberation. Such were
                        the sounds that resounded from all of the mansions. From the sky where the
                        mansions were fell rains of perfumed water and divine flowers that were
                        otherworldly. As for the thus-gone Stainless Teacher’s throne, it was
                        covered with five types of flowers. When flowers were cast in offering at
                        the throne, the power of the Buddha made it so that none of the flowers
                        landed on the ground. Instead they came to form a floral canopy above.</p>

                        minister at one point had a number of golden jars made. There was one jar
                        for sesame oil, another for butter, another again for sugar, and one jar for
                        drink, and one for food. He also had similar jars made out of different
                        precious substances. Presenting the precious jars to the king, the minister
                        asked, ‘Your Majesty, to what foods do these jars belong?’ <ref cRef="F.234.b"/>

                        kinds of jars these are. Here is a water jug, and that one is for sesame
                        oil. This one is a butter jar, and that one is for honey. This jar is for
                        food and that one for drink. These are golden jars and those are of silver.’
                        Thus the king identified all the jars.</p>

                    <p tid="1657">“Now the minister exchanged the jars, and so he poured butter into
                        the jar that had contained sesame oil, and sesame oil into the butter jar.
                        He poured drink into the honey jar and honey into the jar for drinking. In
                        that way he changed all the jars around. He then invited the king for lunch,
                        and when the king had arrived he told the servants, ‘Friends, bring us some
                        water from the washbasin. We wish to wash our hands, so please bring a bit
                        of water.’ The servants did as instructed and so they offered a jar full of
                        water. When King Determiner of Things now saw all the full vessels, he
                        exclaimed to his minister, ‘Chief of the city, have all these jars not gone
                        to waste? The water jar is full of butter. Likewise, do not all illusory
                        things in this way go to waste?’</p>

                    <p tid="1658">“ ‘All things come to an end,’ replied the minister, ‘just as these
                        jars have all lost their previous features. There is no certainty about
                        anything. All entities undergo destruction. All things change. Characterized
                        by impermanence, all things are subject to destruction. Characterized by
                        change, they turn into something else. No thing lasts and nothing is certain
                        about anything. We see things differently and things change. Therefore,
                        great king, train yourself in recognizing the impermanence of all
                        impermanent things. Train yourself in recognizing how all these uncertain
                        things are in movement. Moreover, Your Majesty, <ref cRef="F.235.a"/> youth
                        becomes old age. The youth grows up, the grownup ages, and the old person
                        succumbs. Hence, no thing is certain.’</p>
                    <p tid="1659">“In this way the minister was able to change King Determiner of
                        Things’ outlook. ‘Chief of the city,’ responded the king, ‘well said, well
                        said! I shall endeavor to realize this knowledge.’</p>

                        will be a corresponding form of ripening. So the causes are karmic action
                        and affliction. Yet whose is the formation of karmic action, whose are the

                        to anything other than an assembly of factors. Thus, no affliction thinks,
                        “I shall give rise to karmic action”; no karmic action thinks, “I shall
                        bring ripening”; and no ripening thinks, “I shall ripen on someone.” Rather,
                        the thought of “I” is projected without any real basis, and this is what
                        creates the link to the myriad types of suffering. Suffering does not come
                        from anywhere, does not belong to anything, is not produced by anyone, and
                        is not apprehended, even in the slightest. Why is that so? Because the
                        conceived “I” is not there but just thought to be there. When one is
                        attached to a self that does not exist, the self becomes vulnerable, because
                        one is attached to a self that is not really there. With such attachment to
                        self there will be thoughts of “suffering,” as well as of “purity” and
                        “permanence.” However, when instead one accepts the absence of self where
                        there is no self, and when likewise impermanence, unhappiness, and impurity
                        are accepted, one will not become attached to the conception of a self, even
                        after incalculable eons.’ Thus the sage proceeded to shake <term type="ignore">innumerable</term> sentient beings out of their attachment

                        appear that they take rebirth again after their body in a given life has
                        died? Some are born in hells, some among the animals, and some in the realms
                        of the Lord of Death, and some are born in the realms of demigods. Some are
                        born as brahmins, some as royalty, some as merchants, and some as commoners.
                        Some are born as gods in the realms of the four great kings, some as
                        powerful gods, and some live as king of the gods. Some take birth in the

                        Heaven of Joy, some in the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, and some in
                        the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations. Some leave the human realm
                        to be born as Brahmā. Some are born in the Realm of Brahmā, the Heaven of
                        the High Priests of Brahmā, or the Heaven of the Retinue of Brahmā, and some
                        are born in the Heaven of Great Brahmā. Others are born in the Heaven of
                        Light, the Heaven of Limited Light, the Heaven of Limitless Light, the
                        Luminous Heaven, and so forth, up to the Heaven of Perfected Virtue. Some
                        are born in the Greater Heaven, the Heaven of Lesser Greatness, the Heaven
                        of Limitless Greatness, and the Heaven of Great Fruition. Some are born
                        among the beings who do not have any notions. Some are born in the Unlofty
                        Heaven, the Heaven of No Hardship, and so forth, up to the gods of the
                        Highest Heaven. Still others are born as gods in the fields of infinite

                        action make such different forms of life appear? Sentient beings are of many
                        different kinds and have many different states of mind. Because they
                        experience different afflictions, they engage in different karmic acts.
                        Thus, because their karmic conditioning differs, sentient beings differ as
                        well. In the various hells there are different hell beings, the animal
                        realms include many different kinds of animals, the inhabitants of the

                        Well, all beings dwell on the self and so they generate many afflictions.
                        The afflicted mind, in turn, engages in acts of karmic formation, and those
                        acts come to ripen in various ways. So I shall examine that self, which thus
                        relates to all of that.</p>

                        have physical form but, as physical forms grow or shrink, people do not
                        perceive the self as simultaneously growing or shrinking. Hence, the self
                        cannot be a physical form. Likewise, the self might be thought to be
                        feelings. However, in happy states of mind the self would then be happiness,
                        in painful states of mind the self would be suffering, and in neutral states
                        of mind the self would be neither suffering nor happiness. That is not how
                        it is with the self, and so the self cannot be feeling. <ref cRef="F.247.b"/> If it were perception, the self would transform into happiness with
                        regard to pleasant feelings. It would transform into pain with regard to
                        painful feelings. And it would transform into neither happiness nor pain
                        with regard to feelings that are neither enjoyable nor painful. But such
                        transformation into something else is not characteristic of the self and
                        therefore the self cannot be perception. Moreover, if the self were
                        formation it would be virtuous, unvirtuous, or non-transferring. As such, it
                        would ripen as pleasure, pain, or neither of the two. Yet the self is not
                        held to be virtuous, unvirtuous, or non-transferring, and it therefore
                        cannot be formation. Finally, if consciousness were the self, then why does
                        consciousness transform into happiness, pain, and neutrality with regard to
                        sensations that are either enjoyable, painful, or neither enjoyable nor
                        painful, respectively? The self is not thought to change, and therefore
                        consciousness cannot be the self.’</p>

                        thought, ‘All phenomena arise due to the mind and cease due to the mind.
                        Whatever form a phenomenon takes, it follows from the mind’s way of
                        thinking. The mind gives birth to all phenomena, and the mind brings them
                        all to an end. But what gives the mind such power?’ </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-047-001-1701"/>
                    <p tid="1750">“Then he thought, ‘The mind has no form and it cannot be shown.
                        When it arises, the mind does not know its own identity and when it ceases,
                        the mind also does not know its own identity. The mind does not produce
                        itself, and it does not make itself cease either. Such is the mind’s nature.
                        This immaterial quality is the intrinsic nature of things. The cessation of
                        mind is not an object of consciousness. When the mind arises, it forms part
                        of the mind’s continuum and when it ceases, it is also part of the mind’s
                        continuum. The cessation of the aggressive mind is part of the mind’s
                        continuum, and the cessation of the ignorant mind is also part of the mind’s
                        continuum. Thus one speaks of “desire or anger within the mind’s continuum.”
                        With a knowledgeable mind, one will know the mind’s three continua. When,
                        for example, a man searches for a jar in darkness he might light an oil
                        lamp, and the light would then make him see the jar as well as other things.
                        Likewise, when the mind driven by desire ceases, and the mind of knowledge
                        arises, all the mind’s continua will be comprehended. When the mind driven
                        by the wish to harm ceases, and the mind of knowledge arises, all the mind’s
                        continua will be comprehended. When the mind driven by ignorance ceases, and
                        the mind of knowledge arises, all the mind’s continua will be comprehended.
                        With such knowledge <ref cRef="F.249.a"/> there is no perception of the
                        features of affliction. There is not even any observation of the mind that
                        consciousness sees as being endowed with knowledge. And why is that so?
                        Because that mind is of a nature that is free of ignorance and pride. That
                        which has no essence at all does not arise, and what does not arise does not
                        cease. That which neither arises nor ceases cannot be cognized,
                        comprehended, relinquished, cultivated, or perceived. Just as it is now, so
                        it was in the past. Just as it was in the past, so it will be in the future.
                        It cannot be cognized, comprehended, relinquished, cultivated, or perceived.
                        Despite this sameness of the three times, ordinary beings who are childish
                        and obscured seek awakening apart from the aggregates. But awakening is
                        nothing other than the aggregates!’</p>

                        in, it will yield particular attainments. That which the blessed buddhas of

                        Nevertheless, if one fully recognizes the nature of phenomena, just as it

                        a god from harm. At the first sign no self appears, and no self can be
                        claimed to appear at the second, third, fourth, or fifth sign either. We see
                        no self of the dead and dying. Here there is neither self nor anything that

                        certain to accomplish this absorption that is endowed with all virtuous
                        qualities? For that to happen the bodhisattva must achieve the absorption
                        that does not act on any phenomenon. And why? Because all phenomena are
                        beyond creation; they have never been created.’</p>

                        Thus, as others heard his teaching of the Dharma, innumerably many tens of
