                <p tid="1">The Buddha’s disciple, the monk Pūrṇa, oversees the construction of a
                    temple dedicated to the Buddha in a distant southern city. When the master
                    builder suggests that the building may be used by others in the Buddha’s
                    absence, Pūrṇa argues that no one but an omniscient buddha may rightly take up
                    residence there. Enumerating the kinds of knowledge that are unique to a
                    buddha’s perfect awakening, Pūrṇa then delivers a lengthy exposition that also
                    relates each of these qualities to the knowledge of the four truths. Following
                    Pūrṇa’s teaching, the master builder invites the Buddha and his followers from
                    afar to the inauguration of the newly built structure. They arrive, flying
                    through the sky. After the inauguration, the Buddha pauses with his monks on the
                    shores of the ocean, where he receives the worship of numerous nāga kings,
                    teaches and inspires them, and predicts their awakening. At Maudgalyāyana’s
                    request, the Buddha then recounts each of the specific events in his past lives
                    that ultimately led to the unfolding of each of his particular kinds of
                    knowledge.</p>

                <p tid="2">This long sūtra thus serves as a detailed guide to the different aspects
                    of the Buddha’s awakened wisdom, particularly those that, in many accounts of
                    the qualities of buddhahood, are known as the ten powers or strengths. </p>

                            Blessed One’s Extensive Wisdom That Leads to Infinite
                            Certainty</title>,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-047-001-5" index="1">We have translated the title of this text based on the Tibetan (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bcom ldan ’das kyi ye shes rgyas pa’i mdo sde rin
                                po che mtha’ yas pa mthar phyin pa</title>) while considering the
                            Sanskrit title provided in the Tibetan manuscripts. In the process we
                            have attempted our own emendation of the Sanskrit title, which we
                            believe is the product of a back-translation from the Tibetan. The
                            revised Sanskrit title that we suggest using for this text is: <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ananta­niṣṭhāga­bhagavajjñāna­vaipulya­sūtra­ratna</title>. In
                            arriving at this title, we have been guided by the following
                            reflections: The Tōhoku catalog lists the title, which its compilers
                            likewise attempted to revise, as <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">niṣṭhāgata­bhagavajjñāna­vaipulya­sūtra­ratnānanta</title>.
                            However, the Tōhoku title includes a footnote for <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāgata</foreign> that mentions an
                            alternative reading of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāgan</foreign>. This has led us to believe that the original
                            reading most probably was <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāga</foreign>, and not <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāgata</foreign>, since the meaning of this term is better
                            suited in this context (see further below). The difference in meaning
                            between these two terms is that <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāgata</foreign> means “arrived at certainty” (i.e.,
                            “conclusive / definitive”), whereas <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāga</foreign> can also mean “leading to certainty.”
                            The Sanskrit title given on the title page of the Degé Kangyur reads
                                <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">niṣṭhatan-bhagavat-jñāna-vaipulyan-sūtra-ratna-ānanta</title>.
                            Other Kangyurs reflect variants, although most of them are minor. Most
                            notably, a few Kangyurs (e.g. the Stok Palace as representative of the
                            Thempangma line) are missing <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ānanta</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mtha’ yas
                                pa</foreign>). Also, although the correct form might be <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāga(ta)</foreign>, all of the
                            Tibetan editions that we consulted read <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhatan</foreign> (although <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ā &gt; a</foreign> is common and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ga</foreign> could have been elided in copying). Most
                            importantly, however, they all place this term at the beginning of the
                            title, and not at the end, where it appears in the Tibetan. Given this
                            introductory placement of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāga</foreign> in the Sanskrit title, we believe that so also
                            should <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ananta</foreign> be moved
                            to the beginning of the title as a qualifier of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niṣṭhāga</foreign>. One could of
                            course adopt the reading of the Stok Palace Kangyur where <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ananta</foreign> / <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mtha’ yas pa</foreign> is missing
                            altogether, which would also yield a straightforward title. However, by
                            moving <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ananta</foreign> to the
                            beginning of the title (and thus conforming to the Tibetan where
                                <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mtha’ yas pa</foreign> and
                                <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mthar phyin pa</foreign> are
                            placed next to each other in that sequence) one gets the compound
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">anantaniṣṭhāga</foreign> ,
                            which we believe is the better option. The phrase <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">anantaniṣṭhā</foreign> (or its synonym
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">atyantaniṣṭhā</foreign> )
                            actually occurs in other Buddhist texts, including the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Lalitavistara</title>, where, in a description of
                            the Dharma wheel, we find the sentence <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">akopyaṃ taccakram atyanta­niṣṭha­tvāt</foreign>,
                            meaning, “This wheel cannot be shaken, because of the infinite certitude
                            [of the Dharma].” As such, it is also <term type="ignore">possible</term> that the original Sanskrit might have read <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">atyanta­niṣṭhāga</foreign> rather than
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">anantaniṣṭhāga</foreign>.
                            With this word order, the Sanskrit title becomes plausible and makes
                            sense, both in terms of grammar and meaning. Significantly, in this way
                            we also arrive at a Sanskrit title that can actually be read as a basis
                            for the Tibetan translation, which is a feature missing from the
                            Sanskrit as it is listed in the Tibetan manuscripts as well as the
                            Tōhoku catalog. Thus, with our proposed emendations to the Sanskrit
                            title, the Sanskrit and the Tibetan titles are reconciled. </note> is
                        one of the longer works in the Kangyur, filling no less than five hundred
                        fifty Tibetan pages in the Degé Kangyur. However, in spite of its impressive
                        size, the sūtra has remained virtually unread and unstudied in the West.

                    <p tid="5">The main doctrinal theme of the sūtra is the kinds of knowledge and
                        wisdom specific to a tathāgata, particularly those usually known as the ten
                        powers or strengths (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">bala</foreign>, Tib.
                            <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">stobs</foreign>)—although in this text these
                        ten are not explicitly enumerated as such, and indeed the classification and
                        scope of the qualities presented extends well beyond that usual set of ten
                        (see <ptr target="#UT22084-047-001-2366"/>–<ptr target="#UT22084-047-001-21"/> below). The explanation takes place first in a long teaching that focuses
                        on how these qualities make the Buddha unique compared to any other
                        spiritual teacher, and later in the text when the Buddha himself recounts
                        the roots of merit in his past that have allowed them to unfold in his
                        awakened state. </p>

                    <p tid="2015">The doctrinal content of the sūtra is structured around a
                        narrative in which a sandalwood residence or temple has been constructed for
                        the Buddha in a distant region, supervised by the monk Pūrṇa, who delivers a
                        teaching. The Buddha is invited from afar to visit the temple, and does so
                        by flying there with a large entourage. The excitement of the event causes a
                        commotion among the nāgas in the nearby ocean, to which the Buddha responds
                        by visiting them, too, and then also delivering a teaching.</p>

                            unlikely to be because the translators of the one text were unaware of
                            the existence of the other. They were, probably, simply staying faithful

                        sung by several nāga kings, and (3) stories of the Buddha’s past lives.
                        Although there are no formal chapter divisions in the Tibetan text, we have
                        divided the translation into three corresponding chapters to allow easier

                        temple’s master builder. From the householder’s opening statement, he also
                        seems to be the sponsor, or one of the sponsors, of the building

                            is one of the differences between this version and the episode in <title xml:lang="en">The Deeds of Pūrṇa</title>, according to which Pūrṇa
                            himself is the main instigator and patron of the building
                            project.</note> and he is at first concerned that the building will be
                        left empty during the times when the Buddha resides elsewhere. Wishing to
                        put his gift to good use, he suggests to Pūrṇa that perhaps other spiritual
                        seekers could live in the temple whenever the Buddha is absent. In reply
                        Pūrṇa explains why that would not be proper, since no other spiritual
                        teacher possesses qualities that would warrant their occupying the
                        omniscient one’s residence. To make his case, Pūrṇa now delivers an
                        extensive teaching (which continues for more than two hundred pages) on the
                        omniscient wisdom unique to the Buddha. Pūrṇa lists all the kinds of
                        knowledge that the Buddha possesses in a format that is loosely structured
                        around the often cited “ten powers of a buddha,” as well as the other
                        awakened insights of a buddha, such as his fearlessness and correct
                        understanding. This teaching is essentially an abhidharma exposition of
                        awakened experience. </p>

                        above schema (though with several differences in the order), he also
                        interrupts this structure with elaborations on the individual powers, which
                        he breaks up into further subsections. At times, this results in extensive
                        topical tangents in which numerous subcategories of abhidharma

                        the Buddha knows how it relates specifically to the knowledge of each of the
                        four truths. The Buddha thus correctly knows how to employ every single one
                        of his awakened qualities to bring the limitless beings under his sphere of
                        influence to their own awakening. </p>

                    <p tid="11">This first part of the sūtra is characterized by extensive
                        repetition, with only minor variations as the text progresses through the
                        various lists of the Buddha’s awakened qualities and their relationship to
                        the four truths. This rather stringent and repetitive language is of course
                        reflected in the translation.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-047-001-24" index="10"> To further complicate matters, the recurring phrase that
                            Pūrṇa uses to describe how the ten powers and their subdivisions relate
                            to the Buddha’s knowledge of the four truths is not entirely
                            straightforward. The Tibetan—the structure of which is repeated
                            throughout the text—reads (we have here used “X” to mark the changing
                            topics): <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">de bzhin gshegs pas X

                                khyen /</foreign>. Our translation of this structure is as follows:
                            “The Thus-Gone One correctly understands the knowledge of X. He
                            correctly understands the knowledge of the <term type="ignore">origin</term> as related to knowledge of X. He correctly
                            understands the knowledge of cessation as related to knowledge of X. He
                            correctly understands the knowledge of the path that leads to cessation
                            as related to knowledge of X.” As we read these sentences, we take
                                “<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">X shes pa</foreign>” to be
                            the object of the Buddha’s understanding of the knowledge of the
                            individual truths.</note> To a contemporary audience, such continuous
                        repetition may seem awkward and tedious, and even counterproductive to
                        religious inspiration. However, it is important to remember that in the
                        Indian Buddhist culture in which the sūtra emerged, sacred texts fulfilled
                        functions quite different from those of contemporary literature, which is
                        largely secular. Extensive repetition of key passages is integral to a
                        number of Buddhist scriptures, serving important mnemonic purposes and
                        perhaps therapeutic ones, too.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-047-001-25" index="11"> In his thought-provoking article, “Buddhist Hybrid English,”
                            Paul Griffiths discourages translators from reproducing such repetitive
                            passages (which he finds “paralysingly boring”) on the grounds that such
                            repetition is unlikely to yield significant insights in readers
                            (Griffiths 1981, p. 25). While Griffiths is no doubt right that modern
                            readers may find such extensive repetition difficult to digest and hard
                            to appreciate in terms of literary value, it nevertheless seems
                            important to present texts like this in their totality to allow readers
                            of all kinds, specialist or not, to appreciate the full spectrum of

                        does contain a great deal of detailed information; the many kinds of wisdom

                        known to Buddhist cosmology as the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Bhadra­kalpa</foreign>, or “Excellent Eon,” Butön highlights a passage
                        in the sūtra stating that it may also be referred to as the “Vision of One

                        Tibetan authors tend to focus more on its oddities than on its extensive

                        of the Tathāgata place him in a category so far beyond even the most
                        accomplished of other human beings as to represent an entirely different

                            understands the knowledge of the eye element. Householder, this is how
                            the Thus-Gone One correctly understands it. The eye is the ripening of
                            subtle matter derived from the primary elements conjoined with mind.
                            Within the eye, forms are perceived. Forms obstruct the eye, and it
                            obstructs forms. The eye has seen, it sees, and it will see forms. In
                            order to perceive form, the eye is always undifferentiated. The eye is
                            also included within the eighteen elements as the eye element. Among the
                            twelve sense sources it is the eye sense source. Among the twenty-two
                            faculties it is the eye faculty. That is the eye. It is the eye element;
                            it is the eye sense source; it is the eye faculty. <ref cRef="F.20.b" type="folio"/>
                            It is a gateway. It is white. It is a stream, a lake, an ocean. It is an
                            expanse. It is light. It is a water source. It is a leader. It is a
                            guide. It is a foundation. It is internal. It is secret. It is a field.
                            It is not transcendent. It is the vessel of the demons. It engages with
                            the entities of the self. It enters the empty city. It is to be known in
                            full. It is to be known completely. It is to be abandoned. It is known
                            as the eye element. To know, see, perceive, realize, understand, and be
                            skillful about this is called <distinct>knowing the eye
                                element</distinct>, and that is what the Thus-Gone One correctly

                            inexpressible number of inexpressible eons, since his eloquence is
                            inexhaustible. Householder, you may wonder why that is. It is because in
                            his wisdom the Thus-Gone One knows the matchless sphere of reality. In

                            Thus-Gone One correctly understands the various kinds of physical and
                            mental diligence that arise due to the levels of diligence of all
                            beings. Some beings are physically diligent while they are not mentally
                            diligent. Other beings are mentally diligent while not physically
                            diligent. Whoever has a diligent body but not a diligent mind is worse
                            than those with weak physical diligence. Compared to those with weak
                            physical diligence, they break their training without having been
                            purified, neglect themselves, and lack enthusiasm. Those who are
                            mentally diligent but not physically so will first disregard themselves
                            and then become inspired due to the power of mind. Whoever is diligent
                            in both body and mind is well balanced and therefore neither neglects
                            nor intensifies their efforts. With the cognition of such a balanced
                            diligence they accomplish the accumulations, complete their activities,
                            accomplish their activities, break the chains of the demons, defeat the
                            demons, drive away the demons, terrify all classes of demons, increase
                            the lineage of the Buddha, train on the path, attend on the border,
                            suspend bridges, construct dams, light the torch of wisdom, shine light,
                            clear away darkness, show the path, abide firmly in determined
                            diligence, and ensure that it does not degenerate. <ref cRef="F.79.b" type="folio"/>
                            Whoever has diligence that only arises from the body or the mind will

                            expresses how to arise from the first concentration, as well as the
                            teaching that applies the qualities of the first concentration. He

                            those teachings in which the mind delights and those teachings in which
                            the mind does not delight. He correctly understands the teaching that
                            contemplates and arises from that state. The same applies to the second,

                            great waterfall. Its sound is not created by anyone at all. Rather, it
                            appears due to an assembly of things. Householder, in the same way, when
                            circumstances come together, they lead to the continuity of saṃsāra.
                            When there are disturbing emotions, karma is formed. When there is
                            karma, there is the formation of karmic ripening, but this individual
                            experience is not created by anyone. Rather, it is simply formed when
                            such circumstances come together. When a child is deaf, an ordinary
                            person may think, ‘I have created this karma, it is ripening on me, so I
                            must also experience it.’ Being attached to the sense of self in this
                            way, the continuity of saṃsāra remains unbroken. To know, see, . . . and

                        thousands of beings purified the eye of Dharma so that it became stainless
                        and free of blemishes. Tens of thousands of beings, who had practiced with

                        so that it became stainless and free of blemishes with regard to phenomena.
                        As the tens of thousands of gods witnessed the Blessed One’s miracles, they
                        purified the eye of Dharma so that it became stainless and free of blemishes
                        with regard to phenomena. As tens of thousands of gods in the form realm

                            looked hideous, and his hair was tied up in braids. Seeing him the king
                            was shocked, scared, disgusted, and had goose bumps. He even fell into a
                            state of panic, as he thought, ‘If I don’t give him my daughter, he’ll
                            surely put a curse on me. Nonetheless, I have vowed to serve all
                            sentient beings and shall not go against my word.’ His daughter, whose

                            lovely and she bore all the special features of royalty. He continued to

                            virtue I developed unhindered wisdom with regard to the present. I also
                            inspired many beings toward knowledge of the present, thereby creating
                            roots of virtue that led me to accomplish knowledge of the <term type="ignore">origin</term> as related to knowledge of the present.
                            Moreover, I actualized knowledge of the present and then taught it
                            genuinely, so that many other beings actualized it as well. Due to the

                            Viśākhamitra, here I have explained the remedies for beings no matter
                            what they are involved with. Furthermore, Viśākhamitra, there is a path,
                            and practice related to that path, that applies to all sentient beings,
                            an indisputable medicine: that is to perceive all worlds with aversion.

                            things that harm the world, things that harm sentient beings and bring
                            them suffering. What are these? The harm that comes from aging, the harm
                            that comes from sickness, and the harm that comes from dying. These
                            three things affect all beings living in the world, including demons and
                            even including Brahmā. And yet, how to gain release from them I truly do
                            not know.’</p>

                            truly transcends birth, aging, sickness, and death. Come meet him, all

                            harmful in the world. Whatever the Blessed One then says you should take

                            not born, it will not die. What is born will die. Something that is not
                            born will not die. Whoever has a child, has a child that is bound to
                            die, and yet for those who have no child, there is no child that will
                            die. Moreover, if one’s child also has a child, that child is also bound
                            to die. Therefore, if a child is born it must die. If a child is not
                            born, it will not die. Everyone who has appropriated, has clinging;
                            therefore those who do not appropriate will not suffer. Reflecting on
                            this, I think there must be a course of action, a method by which the
                            blemish of clinging will not come about. I conclude that the blemish of
                            clinging consists of grasping. When grasping is absent, there is no
                            blemish of clinging. So what can I do to take care of all sentient
                            beings and prevent them from grasping? I conclude that sentient beings
                            cannot stop the blemish of clinging because they are not aware of it.
                            Thus they are marred by the blemish of clinging because they do not
                            prevent it. I will take all sentient beings under my care and train
                            them. <ref cRef="F.144.b" type="folio"/> Moreover, I will fully comprehend the
                            blemish of clinging. How will I do this, you may ask? Without clinging,
                            and without awakening, I will develop compassion for these sentient
                            beings. I will care for beings without clinging, and I will stop
                            producing the blemish of clinging.’</p>

                            beings such as demons, Brahmā, mendicants, and brahmins. They should be

                            in the distant past there was a teacher known as Practicing Detachment.
                            He was someone who led sentient beings to freedom and emancipation from
                            the harm of sense pleasures and regarded that state as pure. He led
                            numerous beings to that state and when they became detached from sense
                            pleasures, he would assert that in that moment they had reached nirvāṇa.
                            Thus he was able to establish many of them fully in detachment from
                            sense pleasures. A number of them would then have the idea, ‘I am now
                            perfectly detached from sense pleasures.’ When beings had become
                            detached from sense pleasures, they were told they had achieved nirvāṇa,
                            and that they would never take on a physical form again. He established
                            eighty million beings in this state of acceptance, and they all thought
                            they were liberated. In such a frame of mind, after they died they were
                            reborn in the realm of Brahmā. Witnessing that happen, they concluded,
                            ‘This so-called nirvāṇa is a perverted doctrine. The path leading to
                            this so-called nirvāṇa is a perverted path. Any mendicants or brahmins
                            who espouse such a doctrine of nirvāṇa are preaching falsehoods.’ In
                            fact, after they were born there, although they did see Brahmā’s
                            celestial palace, it immediately vanished and they instead became beings
                            in the great hells. This shows that while other paths may claim to lead
                            directly to liberation, emancipation from sense pleasures is not
                            liberation. </p>

                            named Inferior Class. He perceived sense pleasures to be fetters and so
                            renounced them. He took ordination and eventually achieved the first
                            absorption level, with both conception and discernment. Then he thought,

                            that in mind, he achieved a non-conceptual state of meditation. Then he
                            thought to himself, ‘There is no longer any conception or
                            discernment—this must be nirvāṇa. It is so tranquil and <term type="ignore">magnificent</term>. Without conception or discernment
                            there is no need to continue to reincarnate—there is no longer the
                            slightest appropriation, and so I have passed into nirvāṇa in the realm
                            without remainder.’ Emerging from his state of absorption, he went on to
                            establish six hundred thousand beings in the same state of acceptance.
                            Each of them also thought, ‘Now that I am rid of conception and
                            discernment, there will be no more rebirth. With no need to continue
                            taking rebirth, I have achieved nirvāṇa.’ So pleased with their state of
                            acceptance and experiences, luminous celestial palaces manifested before

                            opposite of virtue. Controlled by negativity, whenever they encounter a

                            inharmonious and dreadful. <ref cRef="F.153.a" type="folio"/> They lack correct
                            understanding of deliverance.’ For instance, if someone is bitten by a

                            to remove the poison. Similarly, foolish ordinary beings become unhappy

                            To this he told himself, ‘One who has no afflictions will understand
                            correctly. Without afflictions then, no karma will be created. When no
                            karma is created, the six sense faculties will not be formed. When no
                            karma is created, that is nirvāṇa. To be distorted is cyclic existence,
                            while to be undistorted is nirvāṇa. What is undertaken by distortion is
                            undone through being undistorted. By distortion one revolves in the
                            wheel of cyclic existence, while by being undistorted one turns the
                            wheel of Dharma. One is bound by distortion and freed by being
                            undistorted. Whoever understands this becomes free from the paths of
                            cyclic existence, eradicates their associated suffering, and achieves
                            the path of nirvāṇa.’</p>

                            long before even the distant past there appeared in this world one named
                            Lord Samudradeva. Nearby him there lived a sage named Vikrāntagāmin who
                            lived off fruits. One day Vikrāntagāmin the sage went off into the
                            forest looking for fruit. In the forest he found a fruit tree replete
                            with an abundance of fruit. At the base of the tree, though, was a
                            poisonous snake. It could propel venom with its breath and, <ref cRef="F.155.a" type="folio"/> once airborne, the poison would incinerate
                            everything within its field of vision. When the sage approached, the
                            poisonous snake was fast asleep, but he thought, ‘If this poisonous
                            snake were to wake up, it would torch everything in sight. I’ll use my
                            magical <term type="ignore">powers</term> to cast it into the pond that
                            keeps the world’s poisonous snakes.’ And so with his magical <term type="ignore">powers</term> he hurled the poisonous snake into the
                            pond. As soon as it landed in the pond of poisonous snakes it died and
                            the other snakes devoured it. Then the sage Vikrāntagāmin said to his
                            students, ‘Young brahmins, the more afflictions there are being formed
                            and produced at present, the greater the suffering that is being
                            assumed. Just look here. I can see that this poisonous snake died in the
                            pond of venomous snakes. This poisonous snake was in fact formerly a
                            human. He did nothing to counteract his faults, and so he incurred the
                            fault of hatred, which escalated and now he suffers from that very same

                            faults. All the misfortune that sentient beings fall into happens
                            because they have done nothing to counteract their afflictions in the

                            past. Those sentient beings who experienced happiness in the past did so
                            as a result of the contemporaneous positivity they fostered in the past.
                            Whatever happiness sentient beings will experience in the future—it is
                            all due to fostering positivity in the present that one experiences

                            appeared in the world one named Sandalwood Heir who had served past
                            victors, and who had limitless faith in as well as limitless fondness
                            for the Thus-Gone One. He saw that in order to attain the buddhas’
                            wisdom, the paths that lead to all destinations must cease. He thought
                            to himself, ‘Complete awakening to buddhahood does not take place
                            through the knowledge of the noble ones, nor can it happen on the basis
                            of any other knowledge. What is the reason for this? It is because such
                            knowledge grasps to something as being real, whether that grasping is to
                            the path, or to nirvāṇa. Complete awakening to buddhahood can only take
                            place when there is no longer the slightest bit of grasping to anything
                            as real. Thus, one must not fixate on knowledge of the paths that lead
                            to all destinations. It is like the analogy of traveling in a boat: once
                            you reach the other shore, you leave the boat behind. In the same way,
                            after attaining complete awakening, you must leave behind the knowledge
                            of the paths that lead to all destinations. As we must, without

                            one string of his lute he could make it sound like a flute, a lute, a
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nakula</foreign>, a beautiful
                            voice, cymbals, a drum, or the sound of ten million other instruments.
                            He was similarly skilled in lyrical composition and embellishment, not
                            to mention at playing the lute itself. He performed before large
                            audiences, and no matter what he played, the audience loved it. His lute
                            never malfunctioned, and he was able to delight his audience with every
                            song he played. As much of an expert as he had become in the art of
                            lute-playing, he found himself going off to a solitary place and
                            reflecting, ‘Alas! How beguiled these beings are by the sound of my
                            lute! And yet they fail to understand that such a sound is transient.
                            Those who understand appearances and realize all that can be seen are
                            called “noble ones.” Just to come to a correct understanding of this on
                            a relative level is to achieve acceptance that phenomena are unborn.’
                            Achieving such acceptance himself, he went on to lead untold hundreds of
                            billions of beings to the irreversible stage.</p>

                            gandharva named Realized by All Beings was anyone else, do not think so.
                            Why? <ref cRef="F.157.a" type="folio"/> Because in those days I was the gandharva
                            named Realized by All Beings. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattva
                            great beings should think as follows: ‘Alas, the sound of a lute is
                            entirely transitory. As it arises, it does not come from anywhere nor,
                            as it ceases, does it go anywhere. While on a relative level it can be
                            said to begin and end, fundamentally it is not anything that can be
                            apprehended. Anything whose nature is to originate and cease, such
                            cessation is said to be merely on a relative level.’ One should become
                            skilled in the practice of engagement. Those bodhisattvas who are
                            skilled in the practice of engagement will never fall from the path of
                            omniscience. </p>

                            buddha, a blessed one. The thus-gone Defeater of Darkness lived to be
                            six hundred trillion years old. It happened that at that time in his

                            ailments. Besides those beings who remained healthy, and those who
                            eventually died of natural causes at the end of their human life, the
                            others died along with their physical aggregates and were reborn with
                            the same fortune as the gods of Making Use of Others’ Emanations. Due to
                            their aspirations, moreover, the majority of those beings were

                            yourself with just one meal, with just one set of clothes, and with just
                            one bed, and to stay with just one wife. Why is this, you may ask? The

                            Please reflect on this, my friend, and be generous. Why? Because wise
                            people should learn contentment. When acting in this agreeable manner,
                            you will not be overtaken by those more overcome by desire. If you kill

                            more. Why should we suffer due to the elements? If I continue to create
                            this, I will only continue to suffer.’ Reflecting in this way, he gave
                            up his kingdom and took ordination. Developing in the four abodes of
                            Brahmā, he then took rebirth in the realm of Brahmā. Maudgalyāyana, in
                            case you may think that at that time King Bandhumat was anyone else, do
                            not think so. In those days I was King Bandhumat. At that time I gave up
                            the defects of the several elements. Since I still now perceive the
                            faults of the several elements, I am free from appropriation. Therefore,
                            Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should come to see the faults of the
                            manifold elements and go beyond attachment.</p>

                            was both wise and spiritually inclined. Once he wondered, ‘What is this
                            self that governs as the lord of humans? By which human name does the
                            self govern as the lord?’ He then concluded, ‘It must be the eighteen

                            these eighteen elements of human beings?’ Concerning this he concluded,
                            ‘They are created by karma, which is itself of three types: the type
                            born out of desire, the type born out of anger, and the type born out of
                            ignorance. Karma born out of desire leads to the formation of the realms
                            of five classes of beings: the hells, the animal realm, the realm of the
                            Lord of Death, the human world, and the god realm. Karma born out of
                            anger leads to <ref cRef="F.160.a" type="folio"/> the formation of the realms of
                            three classes of beings: the hells, the animal realm, and the realm of
                            the Lord of Death. Karma born out of ignorance also leads to the
                            formation of the realms of five classes of beings: the hells, the animal

                            realm. How is this? Desire functions via five senses, while anger
                            functions via three, and ignorance functions via five. How, exactly? Any
                            locus of our desire is likewise a locus of ignorance. Anger is only a
                            locus of the lower realms. Thus, they are referred to as “the several

                            Afflictions can be inferred from the presence of karma. Due to these
                            afflictions further karma is formed. Mind can be inferred from the
                            presence of the afflictions. Due to the presence of involvement in
                            afflictions, one can infer the presence of mind that is attached, angry,

                            the person. In this way the Thus-Gone One declares sentient beings’

                            licking his ear lobes. Witnessing such signs, exactly as they ought to

                            Ganges River. In that buddha realm no sentient beings were born who had

                            from that point onward, I was indefatigable in bringing sentient beings
                            to maturity. How is this? When I was training as a bodhisattva, the more
                            I brought beings to maturity, <ref cRef="F.167.b" type="folio"/> the more they passed
                            beyond suffering. Maudgalyāyana, as inconceivable a number of beings as
                            they were, I was able to lead them all to transcend suffering. One could
                            not even count their number. Maudgalyāyana, applying myself to the
                            preservation of the Buddha’s lineage, I led that amount of sentient
                            beings to unexcelled and perfect awakening, and brought them to
                            maturity. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should practice for the
                            sake of preserving the buddha lineage.</p>

                            craftsmanship. In the course of his training, he learned how to work on
                            golden statues, just as he learned extraction and came to understand
                            value. As he developed his expertise in these matters, he became highly
                            knowledgeable regarding the value of gold statues, so that it became
                            common in every direction of the land for people to remark, ‘Wow, what a
                            master blacksmith he is!’ and to laud and praise him. As he came to

                            gone. With having children come the troubles of having children. Without

                            no pleasure in cyclic existence do not seek out attachments. I take no

                            this sort of worldly knowledge.’ Learning the knowledge of roots, he

                            to the suffering of sickness, and bring an end to the suffering of

                            roots of virtue in order to understand the world. I came to acquire the

                            discipline, patience, diligence, concentration, and insight. Long ago in
                            the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the
                            distant past—a countlessly, inconceivably, immeasurably, incalculably,
                            and inexpressibly long time ago—there was a captain named Kāruṇika. He
                            was clever, bright, prudent, knowledgeable about the cardinal directions
                            and the intermediate directions, as well as about what is true and
                            false, astrology, daytime, moments, seconds, and instants, and he was
                            skilled in means and knowledgeable about the lower realms. Once, feeling
                            confident, and having carried out the ceremonies for good fortune and
                            auspiciousness, he set off to sea with five hundred merchants on board.
                            On the way, the captain who was acting as guide for the five hundred
                            merchants expounded at length about the world: ‘To the east of this
                            world there are <term type="ignore">innumerable</term> other worlds,
                            some of which are being formed, some of which are ceasing, some of which
                            are disintegrating, and some of which are emerging. Still others remain
                            in a state of post-disintegration, others remain after being formed, and
                            others are just emerging. Friends, such worlds are <term type="ignore">innumerable</term>. Likewise, in all these worlds throughout the
                            ten directions there are beings of superior type and beings of inferior
                            type. Some of them are rich, some poor. Some of them are servants, some
                            lords. You should understand the world in numerous ways, both in terms
                            of general knowledge and specific knowledge. My friends, in this way,
                            you should exert yourselves in the world and in knowledge of the world.’

                        <p tid="1162">“What do you think, Maudgalyāyana? In case you may think that
                            at that time the captain Kāruṇika was anyone else, do not think so. In
                            those days I was the captain Kāruṇika. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana,
                            bodhisattvas should engage in the practices of the world and worldly
                            behavior.</p>

                            roots of virtue in order to understand the world. Long ago in the

                            distant past there was a prostitute named Adapting to All Beings. She
                            was gorgeous and had a lovely figure. She was attractive, and had a fine
                            complexion. She was fully developed and sublime. Whoever she was with,
                            she adapted herself to their mindset. She never revealed herself nor
                            gave herself up. In the same way, Maudgalyāyana, if you understand how
                            all composite things truly are, you will see that they are
                            insubstantial. Composite things are in no way fixed. If you think they
                            are clean, they will appear to be clean. If you think they are unclean,
                            they will appear to be unclean. The same can be said for perceiving
                            things to be pleasurable or painful, permanent or impermanent, having
                            characteristics or lacking characteristics—they will all appear in the
                            corresponding manner. Maudgalyāyana, to perceive things as clean brings
                            bondage; to recognize them as unclean brings liberation. To perceive
                            things as pleasurable brings bondage; to recognize them as painful
                            brings liberation. To perceive things as permanent brings bondage; to
                            recognize them as impermanent brings liberation. To perceive that there
                            is a self brings bondage; to recognize selflessness brings liberation.
                            To perceive things as having characteristics brings bondage; to
                            recognize them as lacking characteristics brings liberation. Therefore,
                            Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattva great beings who seek complete nirvāṇa, <ref cRef="F.173.a" type="folio"/> and who wish to bring sentient beings to complete
                            nirvāṇa, should forsake the characteristic of cleanliness and rely on
                            the characteristic of uncleanliness. This can be applied to the others
                            as well, up to forsaking characteristics and utilizing the absence of
                            characteristics—this is the path to liberation.</p>

                            teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, a blessed one. The thus-gone
                            Lokapradīpa had declared, ‘There is nothing that I, the thus-gone,

                            the sage thought to himself, ‘I ought to go before the Thus-Gone One and

                            conquer all opposing forces. The king governed the entire earth by his
                            religion and without the use of violent force. At that time there was a

                            and a gathering of countless sextillions of nāgas. In the thus-gone
                            Peaceful Action’s buddha realm, beings’ life spans were fixed like those

                            long before even the distant past there was a king named Viśvabhū. <ref cRef="F.177.b" type="folio"/> King Viśvabhū had sixty-eight thousand queens, all
                            of whom had bodies like goddesses, were loving like mothers, caring like
                            aunts, and respectful like servants. Dwelling among such queens with
                            qualities like goddesses, King Viśvabhū was nonetheless free of desire
                            and free of anything negative and unvirtuous. He was intelligent and
                            discerning and had come to the culmination of the first level of
                            concentration with its concomitant joy and bliss born of disengagement.
                            Similarly, he reached the culmination of everything up to the fourth
                            level of concentration, in which he abided. After dwelling in equanimity
                            at the fourth level of concentration, he eventually emerged from it, and
                            had the insight, ‘Sentient beings pine after the five sense pleasures;
                            they are totally attached to their desires. They engage in and carry out
                            harmful actions, due to which they fall into the lower states. Some of
                            them create the karma for becoming hell beings, others for becoming
                            animals, others for entering the realm of the Lord of Death, others the
                            divine realms, and others the human realm but with short lives. Some
                            have a longer life, others face less harm. Some end up in a low class
                            while others end up in a noble class. Some have little charisma while
                            others have more charisma. Some have little wealth while others have
                            more wealth. Some are unintelligent while others are intelligent. Some
                            exert themselves in following the current, while others exert themselves
                            in going against the current.’ Then he had the thought, ‘These paths are
                            in disharmony with the goal. I must guide these beings onto the path of
                            the completely awakened ones.’ </p>

                            achieved the five types of superknowledge, he was compelled by
                            compassion <ref cRef="F.178.a" type="folio"/> and thus went from town to town, city
                            to city, and region to region engaged in teaching the path of the ten
                            virtuous actions and putting an end to the path of the ten unvirtuous
                            actions. He then led all those beings onto the path of the ten virtuous
                            actions in that very buddha realm, and turned them away from the path of
                            the ten unvirtuous actions. He dedicated the path of the ten virtuous

                            eon ended, he was again reborn into the realm of Brahmā. There in the
                            realm of Brahmā he led one quintillion beings to the level of
                            non-regression. When that realm came to an end, he was again reborn
                            among the luminous gods. While he dwelled there, he led countless
                            hundreds of billions of beings to the irreversible stage, such that they
                            dwelled where there was no one ever born who was without the Dharma.
                            Applying these hundreds of thousands of methods, after he died in the
                            realm of Brahmā, he migrated among the luminous gods, and from there
                            again to the realm of Brahmā. When on occasion he would appear in the
                            human realm, he would still possess the five types of superknowledge
                            even though there was no buddha present. When there was a buddha
                            present, he would serve as attendant to that blessed buddha.
                            Accumulating such roots of virtue, the blessed buddhas then led him to
                            enter into equanimity, in which he then remained. Whether there was

                            single umbrella of his command. In that era there were six hundred
                            million cities in this world, which was sixty thousand leagues across.
                            The towns, cities, and villages being in close proximity, the domestic
                            fowls of the cities and villages would roam freely in the other towns.
                            There lived King Utterly Stable Conduct. There were no thieves, robbers,
                            or barbarians, but plenty of people of good morals. <ref cRef="F.190.a" type="folio"/> There were many festivals. The world was filled with merry people,
                            and people who cultivated the Dharma were plentiful. The word ‘evil’ was
                            unknown anywhere, let alone actual evil behavior. The environment was
                            beautified by groves, parks, ponds, and pools, like a divine garden. It
                            was jubilant with the continuous, uninterrupted songs of conches, clay

                            incense, garlands, and silk, and there were trees with desirable fruits.
                            Noble beings lived there; there were no other beings but noble beings. </p>

                            one named Stainless Zenith; he was learned and venerable, a blissful
                            one, a knower of the world, a steersman who guided beings, unexcelled, a
                            teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, a blessed one. The thus-gone
                            Stainless Zenith would live for an unfathomably long time. The beings
                            then were also jolly, and had little attachment, anger, or stupidity.
                            They were modest, decent, and possessed the modesty achieved by noble
                            beings. They also created karma primarily with reference to the
                            thus-gone Stainless Zenith. There the thus-gone Stainless Zenith lived
                            and was honored. The pleasant sounds of reverence and worship
                            reverberated, and it became widely reported how noble beings had
                            gathered there. The thus-gone Stainless Zenith’s buddha realm contained
                            inexpressibly many worlds. Within them, the thus-gone Stainless Zenith
                            carried out his acts from town to town, city to city, and village to
                            village. <ref cRef="F.190.b" type="folio"/> Wherever he went, when it came time for
                            him to depart again, there would be crying and weeping. Yet wherever he
                            went there was joy and he was regarded as an agreeable teacher. All the
                            countless quadrillions of sentient beings to whom he taught the Dharma
                            became tamed. He guided some of them with the vehicle of the hearers,
                            some of them with the vehicle of the solitary buddhas, and some of them
                            with the unsurpassed vehicle of the buddhas. When the thus-gone
                            Stainless Zenith taught the Dharma, speech endowed with eight qualities
                            emerged from his mouth and his voice contained the five hundred aspects
                            of speech. Thus, as it emerged, it was understood throughout the entire
                            buddha realm. When the thus-gone Stainless Zenith taught the Dharma, the
                            entire buddha realm was sprinkled with perfumed water. As the Thus-Gone
                            One was manifesting his activity, when the blessed thus-gone Stainless
                            Zenith would teach the Dharma, the sounds of divine instruments came
                            from the sky. Whatever the beings there wished and enjoyed to hear, they
                            would hear as pleasing, beautiful, and jubilant utterances, which they
                            relished. Whatever utterances they enjoyed or desired, they would hear
                            those very sounds. If they desired the joy of nirvāṇa, they happily
                            experienced its bliss, free of anything unwholesome. Those beings who
                            desired the Dharma heard the words ‘impermanence,’ ‘suffering,’
                            ‘no-self,’ ‘peace,’ ‘nirvāṇa,’ ‘Buddha,’ ‘Dharma,’ and ‘Saṅgha.’ They
                            heard the words ‘recollection of the Buddha,’ ‘recollection of the
                            Dharma,’ ‘recollection of the Saṅgha,’ ‘recollection of discipline,’
                            ‘recollection of relinquishment,’ and ‘recollection of the deities.’
                                <ref cRef="F.191.a" type="folio"/> As the Thus-Gone One’s activity came to
                            fruition, cool winds blew on those listening to the Dharma. A delight in
                            hearing the Dharma arose in all those whom that wind touched. When the
                            Thus-Gone One taught the Dharma, due to the stirring up of the wind
                            brought about by Thus-Gone One, none of the five obscurations occurred
                            at all in any respect among those who were seeking the Dharma. </p>

                            the Thus-Gone One’s retinue out of a wish to immerse himself in the

                            it is known as “equilibrium.” The antidote for malicious thoughts is

                            million years. During those days, a universal monarch bearing the seven
                            treasures named Golden Banner appeared (the seven treasures being the
                            precious wheel, and so on, up to the precious minister). <ref cRef="F.194.a" type="folio"/> He had one thousand sons, all of whom were brave,
                            intrepid, and athletic, and who conquered all opposing forces.
                            Throughout the entire realm there was no punishment and no threat of
                            weapons. Instead, everyone lived according to the law. Everyone in King

                            practicing the path of the ten virtues. In the buddha realm in that era
                            there were no hell beings, no animals, no inhabitants of the realms of
                            the Lord of Death, and no demigods. All the beings in the buddha realm
                            at that time were engaged in the path of the ten virtues and their life
                            span was fixed at eighty thousand years. </p>

                            Faculties. He was not free from desire, but had taken hold of the
                            faculties via discernment, not through meditation. So that his faculties
                            would not be afflicted with respect to their objects, he wandered from
                            one remote place to another, from grove to grove, and from forest to
                            forest. After a while he happened to see a woman. Since he had been
                            trying to restrain his faculties but without meditating, as soon as he
                            saw the woman, he was beset with passionate desire. As that passionate
                            desire welled up within him, he caught himself, and then thought, ‘While
                            I am restraining my senses by means of analysis, it is not happening via
                            discernment born of understanding.’ <ref cRef="F.196.b" type="folio"/> He then

                            understanding by which I can restrain my senses.’ While he was then
                            reflecting in this way, he had the following personal insight: ‘The
                            afflictive phenomena that arise in this way must be understood. The
                            afflictions that arise toward women must be understood. By this type of
                            analysis one does not apprehend afflictive phenomena, nor does one
                            apprehend the phenomena toward which one is afflicted.’ At that moment
                            he achieved freedom from attachment to the objects of desire. As he
                            understood affliction, there were no afflictive phenomena, nor any
                            phenomena toward which to be afflicted; by that wisdom of the noble ones
                            he became free of doubt. </p>

                            ‘Wonderful! Noble son, how excellent that you have come to understand
                            phenomena correctly.’</p>

                            at that time the bodhisattva named Non-Deficiency of Mind was anyone
                            else, do not think so. In those days I was the bodhisattva named
                            Non-Deficiency of Mind. Due to those roots of virtue, for seventy-six
                            incalculable eons I did not fall astray or become confused about the
                            Dharma. I never had an unwholesome state of mind, whether born of
                            attachment, born of anger, or born of stupidity. I constantly rested my
                            mind within omniscience. Due to such lucidity of mind, I was able to
                            leave behind my habitual tendencies. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana,
                            bodhisattvas should discern the cessation of phenomena; thus will
                            habitual tendencies be overcome. </p>

                            purification. I did this by wondering, ‘How can I fully awaken to

                            secluded hermitages of the ascetics and brahmins were. </p>

                            Consecration was a thus-gone one named Vimalanetra; he was learned and
                            venerable, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman who guided
                            beings, unexcelled, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, a blessed
                            one. He was a Dharma teacher whose instructions were good in the past,
                            good in the middle, good in the end, of excellent meaning, and with
                            excellent words—unmixed, complete, pure, and chaste. King Immaculate
                            Consecration heard that the thus-gone Vimalanetra was teaching the

                            of <term type="ignore">innumerable</term> monks. When he heard this
                            news, he thought, ‘The Thus-Gone One is wise, as he surely possesses
                            extraordinary wisdom. Since someone with a retinue as big as his must be
                            in harmony with the Dharma, no one will be able to repudiate him. I will
                            go before the thus-gone Vimalanetra, and ask him about knowledge of
                            gathering as related to knowledge of purification.’ </p>

                            and eight hundred thousand wives. At that time the Thus-Gone One was
                            teaching the Dharma, while surrounded by countless tens of thousands of
                            beings. The audience was silent and listening attentively with their

                            someone clearing their throat arose among anyone in the crowd. Due to
                            having gathered roots of virtue in the past, the king was able to remain
                            in equilibrium up to the fourth concentration while surrounded by his
                            eight hundred thousand women. <ref cRef="F.203.b" type="folio"/> Merely beholding the
                            Thus-Gone One, he noticed how his senses and demeanor were calm, and
                            thus felt unfathomable appreciation for the Thus-Gone One. He then
                            reflected, ‘With such a large following, it is <term type="ignore">impossible</term> that someone could repudiate the Thus-Gone One.
                            Why not? Because his following is so large. The Thus-Gone One’s demeanor
                            is so calm. No one else has a demeanor like his. It is extraordinary!
                            Without a doubt the Thus-Gone One possesses extraordinary wisdom.’ </p>

                            Receiving the Thus-Gone One’s reply to your question, your purpose will

                            manifested in the sky above the Thus-Gone One, all of them with their
                            palms together. They were invisible even to the gods of the desire
                            realm, no need to mention humans. However, by the miraculous power of
                            the thus-gone Vimalanetra, the entire retinue of humans, gods of the

                            Immaculate Consecration. Witnessing all that, he thought, ‘No one can

                            his palms together, praised the blessed thus-gone Vimalanetra with these

                            in order to understand abiding. I did this by wondering, ‘How can I

                            about the knowledge of abiding?’</p>

                            a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman who guided beings,
                            unexcelled, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, a blessed one. The
                            buddha realm of the thus-gone King of Banyan Trees consisted of
                            ninety-six ineffable worlds. Throughout the vast cities of that buddha
                            realm there were no realms of hell, no animals, nor any realms of the
                            Lord of Death. Sentient beings there were not of different complexion,
                            but all were alike, sharing the same golden color. The shapes of the
                            beings there were not different either, as all grew to the size of a
                            banyan tree. Neither did their possessions differ, because all property
                            was shared, and the beings of that realm did not have different
                            lifespans. Everyone’s life was equally long, lasting for eighty trillion
                            years. No one died from anything but natural causes and no one would die
                            with fear. Everyone would pass away in special circumstances.”</p>

                            excellent. Generally, there is no apparent existence with respect to
                            phenomena. Therefore, with respect to phenomena there is also no
                            apparent existence for hearers or solitary buddhas. Even the existence
                            of bodhisattvas who have aroused the mind of awakening for the first
                            time and thus brought forth the initial mind of awakening is also not
                            apparent, so why even mention the hearers? Maudgalyāyana, this does not
                            even pertain to the level of those bodhisattvas who abide on the level
                            of a regent. Nevertheless, Maudgalyāyana, they appear due to the power
                            of such bodhisattvas’ roots of virtue. Maudgalyāyana, in this realm,
                            however, beings did not progress by means of any roots of virtue. Still,
                            the minds of those bodhisattvas would constantly develop, without ever
                            waning, throughout day and night. It is in this sense that they were
                            special.</p>

                            In the retinue of King Beyond Doubt there were eight million women, and
                            he had one thousand ministers. Once, during the summer, the king went,
                            without great craving, to a cool and peaceful park full of flowering
                            trees, together with eight hundred thousand of the ladies. There King
                            Beyond Doubt made the following prayer: ‘May all beings who are near me

                            And with this thought in mind he ruled his kingdom.</p>

                            mind of awakening. Whether coming, going, staying, sitting, lying down,
                            or asleep, he was free of any conceit. Needless to mention that he did
                            not become careless either. Instead he continuously entered the mind of
                            awakening. He had love for suffering beings, compassion for afflicted
                            beings, delight at witnessing happy beings, and equanimity with respect
                            to those who had completed their tasks. As he lay down to sleep at
                            night, he gave rise to the mind of awakening, wishing, ‘I must find out

                            my roots of virtue and be my spiritual teacher. How can I rest in the

                            When asleep, in his dreams the bodhisattva would have actual

                            he would accompany the thus-gone ones and ask them questions. At that
                            time there was in the world a thus-gone one known as Unhindered Teacher.
                            Once when in the company of that thus-gone one the bodhisattva Noble
                            Light asked him, ‘Blessed One, how may one gain knowledge of the <term type="ignore">origin</term> as related to knowledge of the world?

                            the ocean itself, and some again sat speechless, thinking, ‘We have no
                            protector of that sort—let us just die!’ Regardless, nobody came to
                            anyone’s rescue. </p>

                            put their hopes in a being who is neither a protector nor a refuge. In
                            their mistaken devotion they perceive that things have essences. Yet

                            correctly, as they are, one does not perceive any entities. There is no
                            certainty with respect to formations. If one wishes for purity one must

                            Similarly, one must give up marks and rely on the absence of marks; that
                            is the path of liberation. Maudgalyāyana, for the sake of knowledge with
                            an interest in several elements I teach that permanence is bondage, and
                            impermanence is liberation; self is bondage, and absence of self is

                            inclinations of sentient beings? What are the various inclinations of

                        <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-047-001-1443"/>
                        <p tid="1501">“He then thought, ‘Sentient beings are concerned about, and
                            take delight in, whichever objects they rely on the most. Those are the
                            objects they are fond of and pursue. They concentrate on those objects
                            to the extent that they will be adverse to others. However, if that
                            object disappears from their experience, they instead become accustomed
                            to another, which will <ref cRef="F.216.b" type="folio"/> then replace the former
                            object as their object of concern. And so the process continues, as the
                            inclinations shift from one type of object to another. Sentient beings
                            will thus pursue whichever object they currently find rewarding and they
                            will be hostile toward whichever object they deem flawed. One should
                            therefore not become obsessed with the qualities of any object, nor
                            should one develop aggression toward any object one may hold to be
                            flawed. Instead, one should discern the objects and then remain
                            neutral.’ In this way the bodhisattva Nityodyukta would neither crave
                            for desirable objects nor be averse to faulty ones. Instead he would
                            discern objects and remain neutral. In doing so, his achievement of the
                            qualities of the bodhisattvas became irreversible.</p>

                            Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should give up concern for all
                            objects and instead be concerned with the transcendence of suffering.

                            Meanwhile the bodhisattva assumed the form of Vegadharin himself and
                            thus he entered the realm of the māras and took up residence there.
                            While in the land of the māras, he made nine hundred ninety thousand

                            the pleasures of the five senses. As the māra Vegadharin, who still had

                            goddesses engaged together in playful enjoyments. To Vegadharin this

                            Teacher. His lifespan was boundless, and his saṅgha of hearers, his
                            buddha realm, and his assembly of hearers were all immense. The brahmin
                            Famous Sound, who was like a great sal tree, had heard of the thus-gone
                            Stainless Teacher, and so he went before him together with nine hundred
                            eighty million other brahmins. Once there, they presented offerings to
                            the blessed thus-gone Stainless Teacher. In the sky above they unfolded
                            a bejeweled canopy and on the ground below they spread a golden floor.
                            They then ornamented the ten directions with eighty thousand golden
                            mansions, each a league tall. Within each one of them resided thousands
                            of ladies richly adorned with jewelry, and from each of the buildings
                            came the melodious sounds of thousands of cymbals. On the ground bloomed
                            flowers of five colors, divine perfumes filled the air, and the mansions
                            were fragrant and delightfully scented with divine incense. Thus, all
                            the mansions were pleasant and delightful due to the scent of incense
                            and perfume. By the power of the Buddha, all the mansions rested in
                            midair without being otherwise supported. From all of them came the
                            sounds of praises to the Buddha, Dharma, <ref cRef="F.224.a" type="folio"/> and
                            Saṅgha. Likewise, each of the houses resounded with words of emptiness,
                            absence of marks, and absence of wishes; of the fruitions of the
                            stream-enterer, once-returner, and non-returner; of impermanence,
                            suffering, and the absence of self; of concentrations, freedoms,
                            absorptions, and equilibriums; of miraculous <term type="ignore">powers</term>, the divine eye, the divine ear, knowledge of the
                            minds of others, and knowledge of past situations and of cessation. In
                            some places one would hear words that accord with liberation. Such were
                            the sounds that resounded from all of the mansions. From the sky where
                            the mansions were fell rains of perfumed water and divine flowers that
                            were otherworldly. As for the thus-gone Stainless Teacher’s throne, it
                            was covered with five types of flowers. When flowers were cast in
                            offering at the throne, the power of the Buddha made it so that none of
                            the flowers landed on the ground. Instead they came to form a floral
                            canopy above.</p>

                            possessed accurate knowledge of the types of faculties <ref cRef="F.225.a" type="folio"/> that are involved when engaging in an action. Thus,

                            He also knew of their austerities, their disciplined conduct, their

                            jar for drink, and one for food. He also had similar jars made out of

                            oil. This one is a butter jar, and that one is for honey. This jar is
                            for food and that one for drink. These are golden jars and those are of

                            butter jar. He poured drink into the honey jar and honey into the jar
                            for drinking. In that way he changed all the jars around. He then
                            invited the king for lunch, and when the king had arrived he told the

                            of Things now saw all the full vessels, he exclaimed to his minister,
                            ‘Chief of the city, have all these jars not gone to waste? The water jar
                            is full of butter. Likewise, do not all illusory things in this way go

                            about anything. All entities undergo destruction. All things change.

                            Characterized by change, they turn into something else. No thing lasts
                            and nothing is certain about anything. We see things differently and
                            things change. Therefore, great king, train yourself in recognizing the
                            impermanence of all impermanent things. Train yourself in recognizing
                            how all these uncertain things are in movement. Moreover, Your Majesty,
                                <ref cRef="F.235.a" type="folio"/> youth becomes old age. The youth grows up, the

                            such karmic activities there will be a corresponding form of ripening.
                            So the causes are karmic action and affliction. Yet whose is the
                            formation of karmic action, whose are the afflictions, and who will

                            due to anything other than an assembly of factors. Thus, no affliction
                            thinks, “I shall give rise to karmic action”; no karmic action thinks,
                            “I shall bring ripening”; and no ripening thinks, “I shall ripen on
                            someone.” Rather, the thought of “I” is projected without any real
                            basis, and this is what creates the link to the myriad types of
                            suffering. Suffering does not come from anywhere, does not belong to
                            anything, is not produced by anyone, and is not apprehended, even in the
                            slightest. Why is that so? Because the conceived “I” is not there but
                            just thought to be there. When one is attached to a self that does not
                            exist, the self becomes vulnerable, because one is attached to a self
                            that is not really there. With such attachment to self there will be
                            thoughts of “suffering,” as well as of “purity” and “permanence.”
                            However, when instead one accepts the absence of self where there is no
                            self, and when likewise impermanence, unhappiness, and impurity are
                            accepted, one will not become attached to the conception of a self, even

                            beings. The king thought to himself, ‘Why do these beings experience

                            flaws of such ways. He said, ‘Because you regard your own lives with
                            such fondness, that fondness causes you to engage in negative karmic
                            acts. It is due to such karmic formation that you race around with your

                            worms, or while engulfed by a foul smell. Since you believe in a self
                            that truly exists, you experience nothing but suffering and never find
                            even a bit of happiness. Because of your beliefs in individuality, you
                            engage in negative acts, and so you experience this sort of ripening.

                            as there are particles in a buddha realm, he determined the causes and

                            by disengaging from karmic formation. Whenever there is no such
                            formation, there will not be any such distinctions. But when there is
                            such causal formation, there obviously will be. <ref cRef="F.242.b" type="folio"/>
                            All of that is due to ignorance and craving, and craving causes karmic
                            activity. Yet beings are not aware of this. If craving ceases there will
                            not be any karmic activity. Yet beings do not understand this either.

                            afflictions. The afflicted mind, in turn, engages in acts of karmic
                            formation, and those acts come to ripen in various ways. So I shall
                            examine that self, which thus relates to all of that.</p>

                            appear to have physical form but, as physical forms grow or shrink,
                            people do not perceive the self as simultaneously growing or shrinking.
                            Hence, the self cannot be a physical form. Likewise, the self might be
                            thought to be feelings. However, in happy states of mind the self would
                            then be happiness, in painful states of mind the self would be
                            suffering, and in neutral states of mind the self would be neither
                            suffering nor happiness. That is not how it is with the self, and so the
                            self cannot be feeling. <ref cRef="F.247.b" type="folio"/> If it were perception, the
                            self would transform into happiness with regard to pleasant feelings. It

                            are neither enjoyable nor painful. But such transformation into
                            something else is not characteristic of the self and therefore the self
                            cannot be perception. Moreover, if the self were formation it would be
                            virtuous, unvirtuous, or non-transferring. As such, it would ripen as
                            pleasure, pain, or neither of the two. Yet the self is not held to be
                            virtuous, unvirtuous, or non-transferring, and it therefore cannot be
                            formation. Finally, if consciousness were the self, then why does
                            consciousness transform into happiness, pain, and neutrality with regard
                            to sensations that are either enjoyable, painful, or neither enjoyable
                            nor painful, respectively? The self is not thought to change, and

                            due to the mind and cease due to the mind. Whatever form a phenomenon
                            takes, it follows from the mind’s way of thinking. The mind gives birth
                            to all phenomena, and the mind brings them all to an end. But what gives
                            the mind such power?’ </p>

                        <p tid="1750">“Then he thought, ‘The mind has no form and it cannot be
                            shown. When it arises, the mind does not know its own identity and when
                            it ceases, the mind also does not know its own identity. The mind does
                            not produce itself, and it does not make itself cease either. Such is
                            the mind’s nature. This immaterial quality is the intrinsic nature of
                            things. The cessation of mind is not an object of consciousness. When
                            the mind arises, it forms part of the mind’s continuum and when it
                            ceases, it is also part of the mind’s continuum. The cessation of the
                            aggressive mind is part of the mind’s continuum, and the cessation of
                            the ignorant mind is also part of the mind’s continuum. Thus one speaks
                            of “desire or anger within the mind’s continuum.” With a knowledgeable
                            mind, one will know the mind’s three continua. When, for example, a man
                            searches for a jar in darkness he might light an oil lamp, and the light
                            would then make him see the jar as well as other things. Likewise, when
                            the mind driven by desire ceases, and the mind of knowledge arises, all
                            the mind’s continua will be comprehended. When the mind driven by the
                            wish to harm ceases, and the mind of knowledge arises, all the mind’s
                            continua will be comprehended. When the mind driven by ignorance ceases,
                            and the mind of knowledge arises, all the mind’s continua will be
                            comprehended. With such knowledge <ref cRef="F.249.a" type="folio"/> there is no
                            perception of the features of affliction. There is not even any
                            observation of the mind that consciousness sees as being endowed with
                            knowledge. And why is that so? Because that mind is of a nature that is
                            free of ignorance and pride. That which has no essence at all does not
                            arise, and what does not arise does not cease. That which neither arises
                            nor ceases cannot be cognized, comprehended, relinquished, cultivated,
                            or perceived. Just as it is now, so it was in the past. Just as it was
                            in the past, so it will be in the future. It cannot be cognized,
                            comprehended, relinquished, cultivated, or perceived. Despite this
                            sameness of the three times, ordinary beings who are childish and
                            obscured seek awakening apart from the aggregates. But awakening is
                            nothing other than the aggregates!’</p>

                            equality of the three times, <ref cRef="F.249.b" type="folio"/> I established
                            innumerably many tens of thousands of beings within the acceptance that
                            phenomena are unborn. </p>
                        <p tid="1753">Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas who wish to awaken to
                            unexcelled and perfect buddhahood must teach the Dharma of the equality
                            of the three times, and they must establish sentient beings within that
                            equality. Bodhisattvas who establish beings within the equality of the
                            three times will quickly become irreversible from unsurpassed and
                            perfect buddhahood. </p>

                            long before even the distant past there was a brahmin named Joyous Moon,
                            who was like a great sal tree. His parents were extremely pure and he
                            and his wife lived in celibacy. He himself practiced recitation and the
                            memorization of scripture and mastered the three types of knowledge, as
                            well as linguistics, Kaiṭabha literature, grammar, the Fifth, the topics
                            of the past, the teachings of the Lokāyata system, the scriptures on
                            sacrifice, and the characteristics of great men. His understanding of
                            the three types of knowledge was impeccable, and he possessed miraculous
                                <term type="ignore">powers</term> through karmic ripening. Living
                            from alms, he accepted the donations of any extremist or outcaste. While
                            thus committed to a beggar’s livelihood, he decided to feed all beings.
                            He therefore prepared feasts that lasted for a thousand, two thousand,
                            three thousand, and even five thousand days. In this way he performed
                            the moon sacrifice for eight hundred thousand years, and for the same
                            amount of time he did not serve anyone with a degenerate mind. <ref cRef="F.250.a" type="folio"/>

                            alms? Let me think about the offerings that we make. Is there perhaps

                            Suffering and his saṅgha of hearers have avoided paying us a visit? The

                            long before even the distant past there was a king and sage named
                            Samantacakṣu. No matter what topic he examined, he would always
                            understand it. Remaining briefly in composure, the king noticed how the
                            arts and crafts of sentient beings were bringing them only little
                            benefit. He also saw how beings were suffering from poverty, and how the
                            suffering of conditioning afflicted them. Hence, he thought, ‘Unvirtuous
                            actions and defiled virtue take beings into the realms of hell beings,
                            animals, and starving spirits. Defiled virtue leads to the realms of
                            humans and the higher realms. <ref cRef="F.263.b" type="folio"/> Undefiled virtue for
                            the sake of moving toward the transcendence of suffering is neither
                            created by virtuous nor unvirtuous acts. When, for the sake of
                            awakening, one at all times and occasions refrains from both virtuous
                            and unvirtuous acts one will gain the acceptance of the undefiled
                            qualities in the present. That which was not done cannot ripen. This,
                            then, is the transcendence of suffering.’</p>
