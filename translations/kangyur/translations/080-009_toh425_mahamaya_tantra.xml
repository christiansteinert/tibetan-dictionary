                    <p tid="4">The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title>, named after its principal deity Mahāmāyā,
                        belongs to the class of Yoginītantras. According to the post-tenth-century classification scheme of the
                        Tibetan New Schools (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">gsar ma</foreign>), the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> is categorized as a Mother tantra (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ma rgyud</foreign>) among <term>Unexcelled Yoga tantra</term>s (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bla na med pa’i rnal ’byor gyi rgyud</foreign>, <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn"> yoga­niruttara­tantra </foreign>). It earns this classification due both to the
                        importance placed on female divinities in the tantra’s maṇḍala and to its inclusion of practices focused
                        on the manipulation of the body’s subtle energies. In this tantra, Mahāmāyā presides over a maṇḍala
                        populated primarily by yoginīs and ḍākinīs, those semi-divine female figures known throughout South Asian
                        tantric traditions for the power they derive from being propitiated with blood, flesh, and sex. The
                        practitioner engages the antinomian power of these beings through a threefold system of yoga involving the
                        visualization of the maṇḍala deities, the recitation of their mantras, and the direct experience of
                        absolute reality. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> also incorporates the transgressive
                        practices that are the hallmark of earlier tantric systems such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhya­samāja­tantra</title>,<note place="end" index="1" xml:id="UT22084-080-009-161">The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­māyā­tantra</title> clearly postdates the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhya­samāja­tantra</title> because of the instances of intertextuality indicated below in notes
                            3 and 51–55. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhya­samāja­tantra</title>, and similar works like the
                                <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhya­garbha­tantra</title> demonstrate significant iconographic and
                            ritual innovations over those works typically identified as Yoga‌ tantras, such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sarva­tathāgata­tattva­saṃgraha</title>. Beginning in approximately the eighth
                            century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, the pacific and regal Vairocana was replaced at the center of tantric maṇḍalas by deities
                            associated with the vajra family, frequently in the wrathful form of Akṣobhya known as Heruka. This
                            shift is related to the introduction of transgressive practices and a wrathful, mortuary aesthetic
                            into the established structure of the Yoga‌ tantras, leading some Indian Buddhist commentators to
                            begin to refer to Mahāyoga, or “Great yoga,” tantras. In the later Tibetan doxographical schemes of
                            the New Schools these tantras would be identified as Father tantras (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">pha rgyud</foreign>), joining the Yoginītantras in the class of Unexcelled Yoga
                            tantra (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">yoga­niruttara­tantra</foreign>). The Yoginītantras
                            would build upon the framework of these tantras as they introduced their own unique iconographies and
                            practices.</note> specifically the ingestion of sexual fluids and other polluting substances. The
                        tantra promises the grace of Mahāmāyā in the form of mundane and transcendent spiritual attainments
                            (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">siddhi</foreign>) to those who approach it with diligence,

                    <p tid="5">Though it is difficult to pinpoint precisely when the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> first began to circulate within Buddhist tantric communities, the work rose to
                        prominence toward the end of the first millennium <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi> as part of an efflorescence of new tantric material
                        associated with yoginīs, ḍākinīs, and other female divinities. The designation <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Yoginītantra</foreign> was
                        conferred on these texts precisely because of their incorporation of a more feminized vision of divinity
                        and power. Yoginītantras vary in style and content, ranging from somewhat disordered and obscure works
                        like the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Cakra­saṃvara­tantra</title> to refined and doctrinally coherent texts
                        such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāla­cakra­tantra</title>. With its distinct narrative style, focus
                        on the mundane spiritual attainments, and near total absence of clearly articulated Buddhist doctrine, the
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> demonstrates a thematic and rhetorical similarity to
                        the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Cakra­saṃvara­tantra</title>, one of the earliest Yoginītantras.<note place="end" index="2" xml:id="UT22084-080-009-162">On the dating of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Cakra­saṃvara­tantra</title>, see Gray (2007) pp 11–14, and Sanderson (2009) pp 158–69.</note>
                        Additionally, considering instances of intertextuality with the earlier <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhya­samāja­tantra</title>,<note place="end" index="3" xml:id="UT22084-080-009-163">Verses 3.12–14
                            of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­māyā­tantra</title> contain a number of close correspondences
                            with verses 12.52, 53, and 55 of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhya­samāja­tantra</title>.</note> and
                        a seeming lack of awareness of more doctrinally and structurally developed Yoginītantras such as the

                        circles in the late ninth or early tenth centuries. It had certainly gained enough popularity by the
                        eleventh century to draw the attention of the prominent monastic scholars of the period.</p>

                    <p tid="8">The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> describes, in verses both terse and enigmatic,
                        the practices and attainments associated with the deity Mahāmāyā and her retinue of yoginīs. Yoginīs, and
                        their close counterparts the ḍākinīs, are renowned for their ability to grant mastery of temporal and
                        transcendent spiritual attainments to devoted and courageous practitioners who are willing to brave an
                        encounter with these often ferocious beings. In this tantra Mahāmāyā is invoked as the queen of ḍākinīs,
                        the queen of the yoginīs, and the supreme secret of these secret goddesses, making her the paramount
                        source of spiritual attainment. The tantra promises the accomplishment of such powers through the
                        visualization of its deities and their maṇḍalas, the manipulation of the body’s subtle energies and the
                        cultivation of the power of transgression through the ingestion of impure substances. And yet these
                        practices are only hinted at within the tantra itself; the specifics are reserved for initiates and are to
                        be spoken only by a lineage holder. Thus, as is the case with most tantras, this text is meant to be
                        practiced only after receiving initiation and instruction from a qualified master.</p>

                    <p tid="9">The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title>’s three chapters and eighty-one verses depart
                        from the traditional narrative structure of Buddhist scripture. Buddhist tantras typically follow the
                        sūtra tradition by beginning with a formulaic introduction meant to establish the time, place, audience,
                        and above all the authority of a given scripture. This formula, which begins “Thus I have heard...”
                            (<foreign type="quote" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">evaṃ mayā śrutaṃ</foreign>), is absent in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title>, which begins instead with a perfunctory “Now...” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ataḥ</foreign>).<note place="end" index="9" xml:id="UT22084-080-009-169">The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Cakra­saṃvara­tantra</title> shares this abrupt beginning. For an
                            in-depth discussion of the implications of this style of introduction, see Gray (2007) pp
                            28–35.</note> This deviation is in part explained by the fact that this is not a discourse of the
                        Buddha, but rather a dialogue between two deities associated with the tantra. However, the lack of a
                        formal introduction leaves it unclear precisely who these deities are. The interlocutor appears to be none
                        other than Mahāmāyā herself; verse 1.25 invokes her by name as the recipient of the tantra’s instruction.
                        The speaker, however, is never explicitly identified within the text. Kṛṣṇavajra ventures a guess,
                        suggesting Vajraḍākinī as the source of the teaching.<note place="end" index="10" xml:id="UT22084-080-009-170">S, F.108b, lines 6–7. His attribution is somewhat problematic as he
                            contradicts the tantra by stating that the recipient of the discourse is Buddhaḍākinī, not
                            Mahāmāyā.</note> Ratnākaraśānti takes a different approach and, instead of concerning himself with
                        identifying figures not explicitly named in the text, considers the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> to be derived from a much larger mythical compendium of tantras (which he
                        refrains from identifying).<note place="end" index="11" xml:id="UT22084-080-009-171">G, pp 2–4. </note> It
                        is in that collection, he declares, that one may find the traditional introduction that establishes the
                        important details of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title>’s setting.</p>

                    <p tid="10">From this abrupt beginning, the first chapter continues with several verses invoking Mahāmāyā’s
                        qualities and describing the powers acquired through her successful propitiation. Tantras centered upon
                        yoginīs and ḍākinīs, whether Buddhist or non-Buddhist, typically emphasize the attainment of mundane
                        powers over the transcendent; in this the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> is no different.
                        The yogī who masters the practices of Mahāmāyā will, the text promises, be able to magically influence and
                        attack others, acquire whatever he desires, fly through the sky, travel through other realms, become
                        invisible, possess the bodies of others, and become immortal. Compared to this comprehensive and
                        repetitive list of mundane attainments, the tantra makes only passing reference to the more altruistic and
                        transcendent attainments. Only once does the text mention that its attainments can be used to benefit
                        others (1.28), and only once does it explicitly announce that its practice can result in buddhahood
                        (3.25).</p>

                    <p tid="11">Following this exhaustive account of the attainments, the first chapter closes with a description
                        of a short sequence of visualization. The reader may be puzzled at this point to find that Mahāmāyā, who
                        had, up to this point, been invoked using explicitly feminine epithets, is suddenly referred to using
                        undeniably masculine terms. Though some suggest this is the tantra of a male deity with a feminine
                            name,<note place="end" index="12" xml:id="UT22084-080-009-172">English (2002) p 47.</note> Mahāmāyā
                            <emph>is</emph> a female deity, as the verses of invocation make clear—she is the great Queen
                        Mahāmāyā, the mother of the guhyakas, and the queen of yoginīs. She is consistently addressed using a
                        specifically feminine epithet, vidyā, that simultaneously invokes her status as the embodiment of
                        knowledge and as the female deity presiding over a maṇḍala. And yet here, and in the third chapter where
                        her iconography is fully described, she becomes the male Heruka, the Virile One (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vīra</foreign>) embracing the consort Buddhaḍākinī. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-080-009-11"/>
                    <p tid="12">This gender ambiguity is clarified when we consider that the tantra describes Mahāmāyā as a
                        feminized form of absolute reality. She is said to pervade everything in the three worlds, to be the
                        source of all the gods, and to create, sustain, and destroy the universe. Most importantly, she is exactly
                        what her name suggests, the “great illusion” that constitutes apparent reality. When she takes embodiment,
                        she can do so in any form necessary, which in the context of this tantra is Heruka, the male deity most
                        frequently found at the center of tantric maṇḍalas. Ratnākaraśānti makes explicit the ontological primacy
                        of the feminine Mahāmāyā; in his commentary he equates her with Vajradhara, the embodiment of absolute
                        reality, who is typically male, and identifies her as “she who has the form of Heruka.”<note place="end" index="13" xml:id="UT22084-080-009-173">G, p 6: <foreign type="quote" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">saiṣeti

                            fundamental identity of both the male Heruka and his consort, Buddhaḍākinī. He writes, “The lord of
                            the maṇḍala is the glorious Heruka, who is Mahāmāyā; the vidyā Buddhaḍākinī is also Mahāmāyā because
                            they both possess a singular intrinsic nature” (<foreign type="quote" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">maṇḍalādhipatiḥ śrī­heruko mahā­māyā, tadvidyā api buddha­ḍākinī mahā­māyā tayoḥ

                    <p tid="13">The second chapter is the tantra’s shortest and most challenging. Its verses only hint at the
                        techniques and visualizations to which they refer. The communities in which the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> circulated would have guarded their teachings and techniques closely, making
                        complete explanations accessible only to an intimate circle of initiates. The tantra’s verses—especially
                        those that appear to refer to specific techniques—are not meant to be edifying, only allusive. It is the
                        role of the tantric master to unpack each verse and convey its practical content to those prepared to
                        receive it. Thus in this chapter we are offered only the barest of introductions to what was likely a
                        complex sequence of techniques.</p>

                    <p tid="14">The fifth verse of the second chapter introduces the primary structure of the tantra’s practices,
                        one the later Tibetan commentators would identify as a framework for the development stage and completion
                        stage practices unique to the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­māyā­tantra</title>.<note place="end" index="14" xml:id="UT22084-080-009-174">See particularly Jamgön Kongtrul (2008) pp 69–70 and 183–86.
                            He writes: “The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­māyā</title> and other tantras set forth the threefold
                            [formulation consisting of] appearance, mantra and reality [yogas]. These three apply to both path and
                            result; and within the path itself, to both the creation phase and completion phase.” (We have emended
                            “shape” to “appearance” to conform with the terminology used in this translation.) Though the concepts
                            of the development and completion stages were present in the Indian Buddhist tantric tradition, they
                            never reached the degree of uniformity there that they did in the Tibetan tradition. The terms appear

                        harness the force of the transgressive act into a powerful soteriological moment. The same holds true for
                        the ingestion of illicit meats: their ritual consumption negated a social identity formed through the
                        observation of dietary and behavioral proscriptions. Through the eating of taboo substances,
                        practitioners’ bonds with mundane society are fully severed and their acceptance into the community of
                        spiritual adepts is confirmed.</p>

                        his mouth. Kṛṣṇavajra explains that this refers to the ingestion of “relative <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">bodhicitta</foreign>” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">kun rdzob kyi byang

                        associated with the ingestion of sacramental substances. The yogī is instructed to gather the five illicit
                        meats (elephant, horse, cow, dog, and human), roll them individually into pellets, and store them for
                        seven days. Next they are mixed together and stored in the cavity of a rotting jackal for an additional
                        seven days. Finally they are taken out and consumed, resulting in an experience of “the great fruitions”
                            (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">mahāphalāni</foreign>, 3.6), which Ratnākaraśānti identifies

                        are common enough in tantric literature, the especially polluting addition of a jackal corpse appears to
                        be a unique contribution of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn"> Mahā­māyā­tantra</title>. We can understand this
                        distinctly unpalatable process as intended to collapse the binaries of pure and impure, precipitating a
                        more complete rejection of dualistic concepts and, as verse 3.1 states, leading to “omniscience.”</p>

                    <p tid="27">The final section of the tantra concerns the method of practice, the sādhana, for the deity,
                        including the details of the visualization of Mahāmāyā and her maṇḍala. The stages by which a tantra is to
                        be practiced are frequently concealed within the text—the order will be scrambled and the details
                            elided.<note place="end" index="20" xml:id="UT22084-080-009-180">We thank Jacob Dalton for bringing
                            this technique of concealment to our attention.</note> The act of organizing these elements is left to
                        tantric teachers and lineage masters, who composed independent ancillary texts to codify the proper
                        sequence of practice. These texts incorporated practices drawn from the oral tradition and embedded the
                        basic outline provided by the tantra within an established sādhana framework that normally included common
                        Buddhist elements such as refuge in the Three Jewels, the generation of the aspiration for awakening, the
                        offering of confession, and so forth. Thus while the core material for a sādhana is found within the
                        tantra itself, each sādhana is unique, reflecting styles and interpretations that are as diverse as their
                        authors. Sādhanas composed on the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn"> Mahā­māyā­tantra</foreign> by the Indian

                                an interesting verse as it seems thematically disjuntive with the preceding and subsequent lines

                                every verse, does not acknowledge it at all. Ratnākaraśānti, on the other hand, uses this verse as

                                settling” (Skt: <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">paramāhita</foreign> / Tib: <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mchog tu bzhag pa</foreign>) [G, p 19]. The similarity of the
                                Sanskrit terms for supreme benefit (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">parama hita</foreign>)
                                and for supreme settling (Skt: <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">parama āhita</foreign>)
                                probably led to a scribal error resulting in different versions of the verse. Because the version
                                found in the Tibetan translation is attested in Kṛṣṇavajra’s commentary, it was followed here,
                                though Ratnākaraśānti’s reading seems clearer. Where the Tibetan translation reads <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sangs rgyas kun gyi rang bzhin ’bab</foreign> (“become the
                                nature of all Buddhas”), Kṛṣṇavajra reads <foreign type="quote" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sangs rgyas rang

                                which is in agreement with the Sanskrit attested by Ratnākaraśānti and which is followed

                                Kṛṣṇavajra’s commentary, reads: “Vidyā! In the three worlds (Tib: <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’jig rten gsum po na</foreign>) there is nothing equal to my knowledge (Tib:

                                of the tantra used by Ratnākaraśānti appears to have, instead, “there is nothing (Skt: <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">nāsti</foreign>) like you (Skt: <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">te sadṛśī</foreign>) in the triple worlds (Skt: <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">triṣu lokeṣu</foreign>)” [G, p 21].

                                variation. In his <title xml:lang="en">Lamp of Suchness</title> [F.2b] he cites the same line as
