                    absorption,” a meditative state so powerful that it enables awakening to be attained very quickly. He also
                    teaches that this absorption has been mastered particularly well by two bodhisattvas, Avalokiteśvara and
                    Mahā­sthāmprāpta, who live in Sukhāvatī, the distant realm of Buddha Amitābha. Buddha Śākyamuni
                    summons these two bodhisattvas to this world and, when they arrive, recounts the story of how they first
                    engendered the mind of awakening. Finally the Buddha reveals the circumstances surrounding the future
                    awakening of Avalokiteśvara and Mahā­sthāmprāpta.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Illusory Absorption</title> is a sūtra that belongs to the general sūtra section
                        of the Kangyur. In the fashion typical of Great Vehicle sūtras, the Buddha’s discourse unfolds within a
                        worldview vastly different in scope from ordinary reality. Here we meet bodhisattvas who have journeyed
                        across billions of universes to hear the Buddha’s teaching, bringing with them samples of the splendors
                        and pleasures that adorn their distant buddha realms. The vast scope of this sūtra pertains not only to
                        the distances traveled, but also to the timespan covered. Through his omniscience, the Buddha recalls
                        events that happened at the dawn of time and predicts affairs yet to unfold in a far-distant future. In
                        this way our ordinary perceptions of time and space are challenged as we enter the worldview of the Great
                        Vehicle. </p>

                    <p tid="5">The sūtra begins outside Vārāṇasī, in the Deer Park where the Buddha first turned the wheel of
                        Dharma after his awakening. This time, however, he is not just speaking to his five previous companions,
                        the audience for his first teaching. Now, we are told, there are 20,000 monks, 12,000 bodhisattvas, 20,000
                        deities, and several hundred thousand other beings present. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-004-5"/>
                    <p tid="6">As is customary in sūtra literature, the Buddha delivers his Dharma talks at the request of someone
                        who poses a particular question and asks for clarification. In this particular sūtra, the role of the
                        questioner is played by a bodhisattva named Padmaśrīgarbha, who asks the Buddha how one can attain a
                        particular type of absorption known as “the illusory absorption” and, after attaining
                        that absorption, quickly attain complete awakening. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-004-6"/>
                    <p tid="7">The Buddha is pleased with this request and praises Padmaśrīgarbha for asking such a meaningful
                        question. He then proceeds to explain that there is one quality that underlies all attainments of awakened
                        qualities and the state of awakening itself. When in possession of this one quality, a bodhisattva will
                        naturally proceed along the path until finally gaining perfect buddhahood. The Buddha reveals that this
                        crucial and indispensable quality is not to abide anywhere in the three realms, whether internally in the
                        mental sphere or externally in the outer world. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-004-7"/>
                    <p tid="8">If one is able not to abide in this manner, one will come to understand that all phenomena are
                        unborn, an understanding that enables one to practice the bodhisattva path. With the realization that all
                        phenomena are unborn comes the understanding that phenomena are likewise illusory and empty. This is the
                        point at which one attains the illusory absorption. When this absorption is attained, one is able to
                        display a variety of bodies in order to teach and guide sentient beings. At that point, full and complete
                        awakening is not far off. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-004-8"/>
                    <p tid="9">Padmaśrīgarbha continues to ask the Buddha about the illusory absorption, and he wonders whether
                        anyone among his peers in the Buddha’s retinue might have obtained this absorption. Indeed, the Buddha
                        confirms, several students have gained this absorption, but all of them have attained their realization by
                        associating with two bodhisattvas, Avalokiteśvara and Mahā­sthāmprāpta, who live in Sukhāvatī, the distant
                        realm of Buddha Amitābha. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-004-9"/>
                    <p tid="10">Padmaśrīgarbha implores the Buddha to manifest a miraculous sign that will summon these two
                        bodhisattvas, so that others may be blessed by their presence in this world and likewise attain the
                        illusory absorption. The Buddha consents and emits a light from the hair between his eyebrows, a light so
                        bright that it illuminates the entire world of Sukhāvatī. When all the bodhisattvas in Sukhāvatī ask
                        Amitābha about the origin of this light, he reveals that it is being emitted by Buddha Śākyamuni to
                        indicate that a Dharma teaching will shortly be delivered. Avalokiteśvara and Mahā­sthāmprāpta request
                        permission to attend the teaching, and Amitābha encourages them to go. The two bodhisattvas bring with
                        them on the journey no fewer than 840 million other bodhisattvas, who each manifest a beautiful mansion as
                        an offering to the Buddha Śākyamuni. Avalokiteśvara and Mahā­sthāmprāpta multiply this offering by
                        emanating 840 million exact copies within each mansion, thus producing a mind-boggling display of gifts. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-004-10"/>
                    <p tid="11">The pilgrimage to this world is not an arduous one by any means, being completed within a single
                        second. Once the bodhisattvas arrive, they pay homage to Buddha Śākyamuni and sing his praises in a series
                        of beautiful verses. The bodhisattvas and hearers in the retinue of Buddha Śākyamuni are, of course,
                        amazed by the arrival of all the bodhisattvas from Sukhāvatī and their impressive display of offerings. So
                        they ask the Buddha about the merit that allows Avalokiteśvara and Mahā­sthāmprāpta to perform such a
                        display. The Buddha reveals how these two bodhisattvas are able to multiply their bodies in inconceivable
                        ways, thus gaining merit by serving countless buddhas in endless realms. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-004-11"/>
                    <p tid="12">Next, Buddha Śākyamuni recounts the story of how Avalokiteśvara and Mahā­sthāmprāpta first gave
                        rise to the mind of awakening that signifies the beginning of the bodhisattva path. We hear how these two
                        beings, in a far, far distant past, were born miraculously from two lotus flowers in the realm of a buddha
                        known as King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play, who himself was a previous emanation of Buddha Amitābha. The
                        place where it all unfolded, we are told, was none other than the world of Sukhāvatī, at that time known
                        as Boundless Accumulation of Precious Qualities and Full Display of Happiness. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-004-12"/>
                    <p tid="13">As is typical of many Great Vehicle sūtras, the Buddha proceeds to reveal the circumstances
                        surrounding the future awakening of the protagonists in question, in this case Avalokiteśvara and
                        Mahā­sthāmprāpta. Once Buddha Amitābha has passed into nirvāṇa and no trace remains of his teachings,
                        Avalokiteśvara will fully awaken at dawn on the very next day and receive the name Buddha
                        Samanta­raśmyabhyudgata­śrī­kūta­rāja. At that point the realm will no longer be known as Sukhāvatī, but
                        rather Complete Gathering of Wealth. Next, once this particular buddha passes into nirvāṇa,
                        Mahā­sthāmprāpta will awaken in a similar fashion and be known as Supra­tiṣṭhita­guṇa­maṇi­kūṭa­rāja. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-004-13"/>
                    <p tid="14">The names of these two future buddhas turn out to be of key importance in the sūtra, because
                        anyone who happens to hear them will be irreversibly destined to unsurpassed and perfect awakening. The
                        blessing of hearing these two names is also such that any woman will be able to put an end to future
                        female rebirths, and in that way join the saṅgha of monks. </p>

                    <p tid="15">At this point the Buddha’s teaching is complete, and everyone in attendance rejoices and arouses
                        the mind set upon unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Many of the listeners in attendance develop various
                        signs of accomplishment and become free from obscurations. Avalokiteśvara and Mahā­sthāmprāpta also cause
                        a miracle so that the entire retinue can behold all the limitless, uncountable buddhas in all directions,
                        who are making prophecies for their unsurpassed and perfect awakening. </p>

                    <p tid="16">As is typical of Great Vehicle sūtras, toward the end of the story the Buddha speaks of the great
                        amount of merit to be gained by upholding and propagating the sūtra, and everyone gathered at the occasion
                        promises to spread the teaching to the best of their ability. The Buddha repeats his statement that any
                        woman who hears this teaching will be transformed immediately into a man. (Today’s readers should keep in
                        mind that these teachings were given in a society where the status of women was generally low, and women
                        were expected to be subservient and deferential to men. It is also important to remember that the Buddha
                        did allow women into his order, which at the time was a radical endorsement of women as worthy spiritual
                        practitioners.) </p>

                    <p tid="17">Finally, while thousands of gods scatter flowers and praise on the Buddha and the assembled
                        bodhisattvas, a young girl stands up and announces that she has decided to give up the negative emotions
                        that cause beings to be born as women. Instead, she promises, she will set her mind on complete awakening.

                        she requests the Buddha’s blessings to help her do so. Immediately her body is transformed and becomes
                        that of a man. With this metamorphosis complete, the Buddha foretells that she is destined to become a
                        future buddha known by the name Repeller of All Disturbing Emotions, and the sūtra comes to an end. </p>

                        sūtra survives in two earlier Chinese translations. The Tibetan translation, by Surendrabodhi and Bandé
                        Yeshé Dé, must have been completed in the early translation period, as it is listed in both early ninth
                        century inventories, the Denkarma (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan dkar ma</title>) and Phangthangma (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">phang thang ma</title>). According to the catalogues of both the Degé and Narthang
                        Kangyurs, the sūtra has nine chapters or sections (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">le’u</foreign>),
                        and the Narthang catalogue mentions that the existence of nine <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">le’u</foreign> is mentioned by the Great Fifth Dalai Lama in the list of texts of which he received
                        the transmission (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">gsan yig</foreign>). However, no such formal
                        section breaks can be seen in the Tibetan text as preserved in the different Kangyurs, and it would be
                        unusual for a relatively short text such as this to be divided into formally distinct chapters. It may be
