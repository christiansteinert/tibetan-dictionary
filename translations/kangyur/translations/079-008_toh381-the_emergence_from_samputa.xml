                    all-inclusive compendium of Buddhist theory and practice as taught in the two
                    higher divisions of the Yoga class of tantras, the “higher” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uttara</foreign>) and the “highest” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niruttara</foreign>), or, following the
                    popular Tibetan classification, the Father and the Mother tantras. Dating
                    probably to the end of the tenth century, the bulk of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭodbhava Tantra</title> consists of a variety of
                    earlier material, stretching back in time and in the doxographical hierarchy to
                    the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhyasamāja</title>, a text traditionally regarded
                    as the first tantra in the Father group. Drawing from about sixteen well-known
                    and important works, including the most seminal of the Father and Mother
                    tantras, it serves as a digest of this entire group, treating virtually every
                    aspect of advanced tantric theory and practice. As such, it has always occupied
                    a prominent position among canonical works of its class, remaining to this day a
                    rich source of quotations for Tibetan exegetes.</p>

                    <p tid="8">Because of the extremely rich and varied content and complex
                        intertextuality of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭodbhava Tantra</title>
                        (henceforth, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>), it would be
                        difficult in the space of just a few pages to give a comprehensive
                        description of this text. The focus of this introduction is therefore mainly
                        on the specific issues that make this tantra stand out among other tantras,
                        its unique quandaries, and also some of the problems encountered in the
                        preparation, for the first time, of the Sanskrit edition and English
                        translation of the complete text of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>. Some prior awareness of these problems could prove
                        helpful to anyone intending to read the translation presented here. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-079-008-4"/>
                    <p tid="9">In the broadest system of categorization of all tantras into either
                        “root” or “explanatory,” the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> falls
                        into the latter category, even though it does not exactly “explain” the
                        material from the chronologically earlier root tantras; rather, it provides
                        a synopsis of that material, quoting from the sources selectively, either
                        verbatim or with modifications. As a synopsis, however, it still fits into
                        one of the sub-categories of “explanatory” tantras. Treating not one, but a
                        whole range of earlier works (incidentally, not all of them root or even
                        explanatory tantras), it can be further categorized as a “shared” or
                        “common” explanatory tantra. The tantric writer Indrabhūti (though it is not
                        certain which Indrabhūti!) described the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> as “the elucidator of three million six hundred
                        thousand cycles of tantras.” He lists, however, only seventeen titles
                        (Verrill 2012, p. 184) as those “elucidated.” Some sixteen texts, for the
                        most part matching Indrabhūti’s list, have been identified in Szántó (2013).
                        For the sake of those wishing to study the intertextuality of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>, many of the corresponding passages
                        have been noted in the text of the accompanying Sanskrit edition of the
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>, specifying the title of the
                        source text, and the page and verse numbers.</p>

                    <p tid="10">The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> is a fascinating work,
                        albeit difficult and full of challenges. Many features of its
                        intertextuality and philological history would baffle a traditionalist,
                        excite a scholar, or perplex someone seeking to reconcile the traditionalist
                        and philological approaches. Rather than trying to confine the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> within established categories, one
                        should perhaps allow the text itself to inform one’s understanding of
                        tantric scripture in general, and revealed scripture in particular. A brief
                        look at key attributes of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>’s
                        origin and structural composition may be helpful, as they tie in with this
                        tantra’s title and the nature of its content.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-079-008-6"/>
                    <p tid="11">Although a revealed scripture, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> doesn’t fit the model of linear intertextuality
                        particular to revealed literature, where a text is usually claimed to be a
                        recap of its own (“now lost”) longer version, which, in turn, might have
                        been only a summary of a still older and longer version. Instead, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> is a digest of earlier texts. The
                        parts incorporated into the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>, even
                        when modified, always tend to preserve the meter, language (whether
                        classical Sanskrit, BHS, BHS influenced, or Apabhraṃśa), and style of the
                        original sources, thus ruling out the possibility that it might have been
                        the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> that served as the single
                        source for all these individual works. Moreover, some of these sources,
                        having author names given in colophons, are not revealed literature
                        themselves. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Prajñopāyaviniścayasiddhi</title>,
                        for example, was composed by the celebrated scholar Anaṅgavajra; the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vasantatilakā</title>, by Kṛṣṇācārya; and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vajrāmṛtaṭīkā</title>, according to its colophon in
                        the Tengyur, by Bhago. The parts based on the last of these sources, the
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vajrāmṛtaṭīkā</title>, have been adapted, as
                        shown in Szántó (2013), from being a commentary to being a dialogue between
                        the Blessed One and his interlocutor, specifically to fit the conventions of
                        a revealed scripture, with the Blessed One prompted to teach by the
                        interlocutor. Apart from the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vajrāmṛtaṭīkā</title>,
                        a few of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>’s other sources might
                        have originally been composed as commentaries, as they still preserve, in
                        places, the typical commentarial style of what seem to be lemmata followed
                        by glosses. This incorporated material constitutes more than half of the
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>’s content.</p>

                    <p tid="12">As regards revealed literature, the tradition does seem to allow for
                        a compilation of extracts, or other such collated or composite forms, to be

                        sources is attributed to the awakened activity of the Buddha’s sambhogakāya,

                        however, no such act of a divinely inspired compilation is mentioned.
                        Instead, the tantra is introduced as having been delivered by a sambhogakāya
                        deity residing in the realm of nonduality—more precisely, in the bhagas of
                        the goddesses of the vajra realm. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> starts with the usual words of an anonymous narrator,
                        “Thus have I heard at one time,” followed by the description of the
                        circumstances of this tantra’s original delivery. Since such an opening sets
                        the narrative frame by stating the occasion and the reason for the delivery
                        of the tantra—the reason being that it was requested by one of the assembled
                        bodhisattvas for the Blessed One to teach—it is termed the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nidāna</foreign> (foundation).</p>

                        the same group as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> itself defines this class as “the

                        can be regarded as a nondual, blissful awareness as expressed by the sexual

                        All these esoteric connotations, however, boil down to the union (sampuṭa)
                        of emptiness (female) and compassion (male), or gnosis and skillful means.
                        The cultivation of this nondual state (sampuṭa) is the central theme of the
                        Father and Mother tantras, with the former laying the theoretical foundation
                        for the processes that occur in the body by explaining the subtle body with
                        its channels, winds, and drops, and the latter shifting the emphasis to the
                            <term>consort</term> practice with its powerful dynamic. Whatever the
                        exact method, the result of this practice is the recognition of the

                        which emptiness and compassion are an indivisible unity. </p>

                        tantras of the Saṃvara cycle, can be regarded as the cornerstone for the

                        The above verse defines Vajrasattva, who “comprises all buddhas” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sarvabuddhamayaḥ</foreign>), as “supreme
                        bliss” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">paraṃ sukham</foreign>). As
                        such, he is “ever-present” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sadā

                        referring to Vajrasattva/Saṃvara’s indivisibility from the ḍākinīs (as such,

                        however, are usually interpreted as the movement of vital energies in the

                        sampuṭa” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sampuṭodbhava</foreign>),
                        which happens to be the title and also the central idea of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>. But just as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sampuṭa</foreign> can be defined in more
                        than one way, so too can <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sampuṭodbhava</foreign>. In the most general sense, this “emergence”
                        may comprise all animate and inanimate things. Inversely, as these entities
                        arise from sampuṭa, sampuṭa is their intrinsic characteristic (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">lakṣaṇa</foreign>). This perspective
                        naturally applies to all the Father and Mother tantras, themselves an

                        and a teaching <emph>on</emph> sampuṭa. In a more specific sense, “emergence

                        sampuṭa, wherein its two defining elements of emptiness and compassion arise
                        as gnosis and skillful means respectively.</p>

                        present translation have mostly been made in favor of the interpretations
                        specific to the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>. Except for the

                        obviously corrupt, there was no obvious reason to deny the intentionality
                        behind the textual modifications found there, such as the intention to
                        re-contextualize the content and give the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> its own textual integrity (although by no means a
                        complete integrity!). Such intentional modifications should perhaps be
                        respected, despite the fact that the corresponding content in the source
                        tantras was historically earlier and could be regarded as “original.” Also,
                        speaking in general, the teachings and methods presented in the tantras tend
                        to be fluid in character, with their main value, for a practitioner, perhaps
                        lying in their efficacy, rather than absolute fidelity to historically
                        earlier sources.</p>

                            his shoulder, and kneeled on his right knee. With palms joined, he said

                            practitioners, who are beyond the fear of saṃsāric existence, will
                            meditate with a pristine mind. In this way, through the application of
                            skillful means and insight, they will attain the true and pristine
                            state, whose character is the nature of original awareness. Through the
                            transformative power of insight and skillful means, they will become
                            equal to space, illuminating the three realms. This goal is difficult to
                            attain, universally present, and free of causes and conditions. Acting
                            in the world on behalf of oneself and others like a wish-fulfilling gem
                            is the supreme of all siddhis.” {1.4.53}</p>

                                    text is missing here. The Skt. just says “he gives,” which seems
                                    to suggest that Brahmā, who is mentioned two lines above, will
                                    give whatever he is asked for. The Tibetan (99b.5), however,
                                    interprets this as “He should also give the scintillation / Of
                                    different [colored] light rays, radiating all around, / Composed

                                    verse. The Tib. then connects the rest of the verse as follows:

                                    rim. As for the rim: “At a spot dedicated to pacifying, the
                                    inner perimeter should be marked with a vajra, the middle
                                    perimeter should be marked with a diadem, and the outer
                                    perimeter should be with a lotus. For enriching, the inner
                                    perimeter should be marked with a jewel vajra. For overpowering,
                                    it should be marked with a garland of lotuses. And for

                                    vajras.” Comm1 (598) interprets this similarly to be marks on
                                    the rim and the center of the hearth / pit: “Along the corners
                                    outside of it (the pit) should be three-pronged vajra scepters
                                    of wrath, which are [also] in the pit for rites of destruction.
                                    For pacifying there should be wheels, or three-pronged vajra

                                    interpretive, based on Comm3 (298a), which seems to understand
                                    the “five protrusions of the stūpas” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">pañcasphoṭikastūpānām</foreign>) as the five
                                    syllables visualized as blocking the five upper subtle channels
                                    (the “stūpas”). He later specifies the number of these syllables
                                    as eight, but this inconsistency could perhaps be due to the
                                    fact that three of the gates (eyes, ears, and nostrils) require
                                    using the same syllable. Other commentaries identify the “five
                                    protrusions” differently. Comm1 (642-645) and Bu ston
                                    (F.316a.3-4) identify this as the human body, the “protrusions”
                                    being the head, arms, and legs. Bhavabhaṭṭa (Sz 4.3.43cd)
                                    interprets the “five protrusions” (or the “five bursts”) as the
                                    syllable <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="mantra">hūṁ</foreign>.
                                    Durjayacandra (f.45v1-2) seems to identify these five as the
                                    five subtle channels with the natures of the five buddhas,
                                    converging at the throat. The “stūpa” is interpreted by all
                                    commentators except Indrabhūti as a location. Comm1 (642-645)
                                    and Bu ston (F. 316a.3-4) identify it as the head, Durjayacandra
                                    (f.45v1-2) as the heart, and Bhavabhaṭṭa (Sz 4.3.43cd) as the
                                    space between the eyebrows. In the Degé (146b.6-7) this
                                    half-stanza reads, “One should visualize the orifices of the

                                    wind”) as reflected in the Lhasa edition. The only <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> commentary that seems to
                                    support (or at least not contradict) this reading is Comm3
                                    (299a), where we read, “ ‘The root of the seed of wind’ [is
                                    explained as follows:] ‘root’ refers to the ‘wind of shape’ (

                                    from the edge to the top.” The remaining commentaries seem to
                                    reflect the reading “the wind is its root,” adopted also by the
                                    Degé edition. Butön (F.316a.3-4) interprets the “syllable of
                                    wind” and its “root” as the beginningless continuity of cause
                                    and effect, rather than their visualized spatial aspects: “ ‘The
                                    root of the seed of wind’ indicates, like [seed, root,] and
                                    sprout, that it comes about from a beginningless continuity of
                                    cause and effect.” Comm2 (1012) says, “ ‘Its root is wind’ means
                                    that the seed syllable <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="mantra">hūṁ</foreign> is at the root of the maṇḍala of wind.” Comm1
                                    (643) says, “The seed syllable of wind is <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="mantra">yuṁ</foreign>. Since the
                                    root of wind is its (the seed syllable’s) roots, [wind] is
                                    rooted in its seed syllable. This incidentally indicates all
                                    variety of notions, such as seed, sprout, and the rest, in which

                                    interpretation. Comm1 (687) has the “great queens,” in the
                                    plural, referring to a few sets of four goddess, such as
                                    “Pukkasī and so forth,” whereas it treats “the vajra ladies”
                                    (instead of “the vajra lord”) also in the plural, as referring
                                    to the four goddesses, “the Horse Faced One,” and so forth.

                        (the folio numbers with letters indicating either verso or recto have been
                        added in braces), the textual variants have been reported in the critical
                        apparatus only when the reading in C was rejected in favor of another
                        source. In a minority of cases though, the variants were reported even when
                        C was followed, if the rejected readings were deemed significant.</p>

                    <p tid="2235">However, many minor changes have been made without reporting this
                        in the critical apparatus. This applies, <foreign xml:lang="la" type="term">inter alia</foreign>, to the standardization of sibilants and nasal
                        sounds, the doubling of some single consonants (or reducing a double to a
                        single), and many other orthographic and sandhi emendments. Whenever it
                        seemed to have a purpose (as, for example, <foreign xml:lang="la" type="term">metri causa</foreign>, or to follow a convention applying to
                        a particular section of the text), the lack of sandhi was left un-emended,
                        or, inversely, a sandhi was replaced by its absence. The absence of sandhi,
                        most of the time, is indicated by the “bullet” (•).</p>

                        extent of BHS influence, somewhat different editorial <term type="ignore">principles</term> were applied in different parts. Thus, e.g., in parts

                        in place, resulting in what at a first glance may seem grammatical
                        “anomalies.” On some rare occasions, when the information to go by was
                        insufficient, the erroneous syntactical or other features were left

                        accompanying translation, and not to serve as a philological study of the
                        text in its own right. To fulfill the latter purpose, some of its obvious
                        shortcomings would need to be remedied.</p>

                    <p tid="2239">One such shortcomings (to mention but a few) is that the relative
                        reliance on different manuscripts varies from part to part. Manuscript R,
                        for example, whose value was realized late in the editorial work, starts
                        featuring prominently in the critical apparatus only toward the end of the
                        first sub-chapter of chapter seven, replacing, in terms of reliance,
                        manuscript T1. However, some readings from R were later added to the
                        preceding chapters as well. </p>

                        emendation was merely cosmetic (such as, e.g., the changing of an anusvara
                        to <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">m</foreign> before vowels), are
                        not always followed by an “<foreign xml:lang="la" type="term">em.</foreign>”
                        (for “emended”), but simply by the manuscript siglum.</p>

                    <p tid="2241">For those interested in the intertextuality of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>, this edition includes markers
                        indicating points of correspondence with parallel passages in some of the
                        source texts. Each marker consists of a siglum followed by chapter and verse
                        numbers, followed by arrows. For example, “Sz 1.2.3d→” would indicate that
                        the corresponding passage is in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Catuṣpīṭha</title>, and begins (right arrow) from the fourth (d) pāda
                        of the third verse of the second part of the first chapter, while the
                        subsequent “Sz 1.2.15b←” would indicate that this passage ends (left arrow)
                        with the second (b) pāda of the fifteenth verse of the same part. When
                        marking prose, the markers do not include the letters indicating pādas (a,
                        b, c, d, and sometimes e and f), but include the word “prose” instead. The
                        markers of prose passages do not specify the precise location, but since the
                        textual units that the numbers refer to are usually short, it will be easy
                        to find the exact points of correspondence in the relevant source texts.</p>
