                    all-inclusive compendium of Buddhist theory and practice as taught in the two
                    higher divisions of the Yoga class of tantras, the “higher” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uttara</foreign>) and the “highest” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niruttara</foreign>), or, following the
                    popular Tibetan classification, the Father and the Mother tantras. Dating
                    probably to the end of the tenth century, the bulk of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭodbhava Tantra</title> consists of a variety of
                    earlier material, stretching back in time and in the doxographical hierarchy to
                    the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhyasamāja</title>, a text traditionally regarded
                    as the first tantra in the Father group. Drawing from about sixteen well-known
                    and important works, including the most seminal of the Father and Mother
                    tantras, it serves as a digest of this entire group, treating virtually every
                    aspect of advanced tantric theory and practice. As such, it has always occupied
                    a prominent position among canonical works of its class, remaining to this day a
                    rich source of quotations for Tibetan exegetes.</p>

                    the Tengyur, and Wiesiek’s Sanskrit edition, and edited the translation.

                    <p tid="8">Because of the extremely rich and varied content and complex
                        intertextuality of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭodbhava Tantra</title>
                        (henceforth, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>), it would be
                        difficult in the space of just a few pages to give a comprehensive
                        description of this text. The focus of this introduction is therefore mainly
                        on the specific issues that make this tantra stand out among other tantras,
                        its unique quandaries, and also some of the problems encountered in the
                        preparation, for the first time, of the Sanskrit edition and English
                        translation of the complete text of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>. Some prior awareness of these problems could prove
                        helpful to anyone intending to read the translation presented here. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-079-008-4"/>
                    <p tid="9">In the broadest system of categorization of all tantras into either
                        “root” or “explanatory,” the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> falls
                        into the latter category, even though it does not exactly “explain” the
                        material from the chronologically earlier root tantras; rather, it provides
                        a synopsis of that material, quoting from the sources selectively, either
                        verbatim or with modifications. As a synopsis, however, it still fits into
                        one of the sub-categories of “explanatory” tantras. Treating not one, but a
                        whole range of earlier works (incidentally, not all of them root or even
                        explanatory tantras), it can be further categorized as a “shared” or
                        “common” explanatory tantra. The tantric writer Indrabhūti (though it is not
                        certain which Indrabhūti!) described the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> as “the elucidator of three million six hundred
                        thousand cycles of tantras.” He lists, however, only seventeen titles
                        (Verrill 2012, p. 184) as those “elucidated.” Some sixteen texts, for the
                        most part matching Indrabhūti’s list, have been identified in Szántó (2013).
                        For the sake of those wishing to study the intertextuality of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>, many of the corresponding passages
                        have been noted in the text of the accompanying Sanskrit edition of the
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>, specifying the title of the
                        source text, and the page and verse numbers.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-079-008-5"/>
                    <p tid="10">The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> is a fascinating work,
                        albeit difficult and full of challenges. Many features of its
                        intertextuality and philological history would baffle a traditionalist,
                        excite a scholar, or perplex someone seeking to reconcile the traditionalist
                        and philological approaches. Rather than trying to confine the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> within established categories, one
                        should perhaps allow the text itself to inform one’s understanding of
                        tantric scripture in general, and revealed scripture in particular. A brief
                        look at key attributes of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>’s
                        origin and structural composition may be helpful, as they tie in with this
                        tantra’s title and the nature of its content.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-079-008-6"/>
                    <p tid="11">Although a revealed scripture, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> doesn’t fit the model of linear intertextuality
                        particular to revealed literature, where a text is usually claimed to be a
                        recap of its own (“now lost”) longer version, which, in turn, might have
                        been only a summary of a still older and longer version. Instead, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> is a digest of earlier texts. The
                        parts incorporated into the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>, even
                        when modified, always tend to preserve the meter, language (whether
                        classical Sanskrit, BHS, BHS influenced, or Apabhraṃśa), and style of the
                        original sources, thus ruling out the possibility that it might have been
                        the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title> that served as the single
                        source for all these individual works. Moreover, some of these sources,
                        having author names given in colophons, are not revealed literature
                        themselves. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Prajñopāyaviniścayasiddhi</title>,
                        for example, was composed by the celebrated scholar Anaṅgavajra; the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vasantatilakā</title>, by Kṛṣṇācārya; and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vajrāmṛtaṭīkā</title>, according to its colophon in
                        the Tengyur, by Bhago. The parts based on the last of these sources, the
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vajrāmṛtaṭīkā</title>, have been adapted, as
                        shown in Szántó (2013), from being a commentary to being a dialogue between
                        the Blessed One and his interlocutor, specifically to fit the conventions of
                        a revealed scripture, with the Blessed One prompted to teach by the
                        interlocutor. Apart from the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vajrāmṛtaṭīkā</title>,
                        a few of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>’s other sources might
                        have originally been composed as commentaries, as they still preserve, in
                        places, the typical commentarial style of what seem to be lemmata followed
                        by glosses. This incorporated material constitutes more than half of the
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>’s content.</p>

                    <p tid="12">As regards revealed literature, the tradition does seem to allow for
                        a compilation of extracts, or other such collated or composite forms, to be
                        classed as such. We find an example of this in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kurukullākalpa</title>, where we read:</p>

                        All these esoteric connotations, however, boil down to the union (sampuṭa)
                        of emptiness (female) and compassion (male), or gnosis and skillful means.
                        The cultivation of this nondual state (sampuṭa) is the central theme of the
                        Father and Mother tantras, with the former laying the theoretical foundation
                        for the processes that occur in the body by explaining the subtle body with
                        its channels, winds, and drops, and the latter shifting the emphasis to the
                            <term>consort</term> practice with its powerful dynamic. Whatever the
                        exact method, the result of this practice is the recognition of the

                        The above verse defines Vajrasattva, who “comprises all buddhas” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sarvabuddhamayaḥ</foreign>), as “supreme
                        bliss” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">paraṃ sukham</foreign>). As

                        which happens to be the title and also the central idea of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>. But just as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sampuṭa</foreign> can be defined in more

                        arise from sampuṭa, sampuṭa is their intrinsic characteristic (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">lakṣaṇa</foreign>). This perspective
                        naturally applies to all the Father and Mother tantras, themselves an

                        sampuṭa, wherein its two defining elements of emptiness and compassion arise

                        individual editions of the Kangyur also disagreeing with one another. The
                        three Sanskrit commentaries, available in Tibetan translation only (see the
                        Bibliography), might narrow down the choice of options, but also might, and
                        often do, contribute to the confusion, as the individual views of the
                        commentators can diverge quite a lot. Complicating matters further, until
                        the publication in China of Abhayākaragupta’s famous <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Āmnāyamañjarī</title> commentary in 2015, which we
                        were unfortunately unable to consult for this translation, these three
                        commentaries were available only in Tibetan translation. A careful
                        comparison of Abhāyakagupta’s commentary in Sanskrit remains a desideratum. </p>

                        tantras was historically earlier and could be regarded as “original.” Also,
                        speaking in general, the teachings and methods presented in the tantras tend
                        to be fluid in character, with their main value, for a practitioner, perhaps
                        lying in their efficacy, rather than absolute fidelity to historically

                            meditate with a pristine mind. In this way, through the application of
                            skillful means and insight, they will attain the true and pristine
                            state, whose character is the nature of original awareness. Through the
                            transformative power of insight and skillful means, they will become
                            equal to space, illuminating the three realms. This goal is difficult to
                            attain, universally present, and free of causes and conditions. Acting
                            in the world on behalf of oneself and others like a wish-fulfilling gem
                            is the supreme of all siddhis.” {1.4.53}</p>

                                    to suggest that Brahmā, who is mentioned two lines above, will
                                    give whatever he is asked for. The Tibetan (99b.5), however,
                                    interprets this as “He should also give the scintillation / Of

                                    rim. As for the rim: “At a spot dedicated to pacifying, the
                                    inner perimeter should be marked with a vajra, the middle
                                    perimeter should be marked with a diadem, and the outer
                                    perimeter should be with a lotus. For enriching, the inner
                                    perimeter should be marked with a jewel vajra. For overpowering,
                                    it should be marked with a garland of lotuses. And for

                                    vajras.” Comm1 (598) interprets this similarly to be marks on
                                    the rim and the center of the hearth / pit: “Along the corners
                                    outside of it (the pit) should be three-pronged vajra scepters
                                    of wrath, which are [also] in the pit for rites of destruction.
                                    For pacifying there should be wheels, or three-pronged vajra

                                    supported also by the Degé (141a.3–4): “He should form the

                                    translation of this highly enigmatic half-stanza is
                                    interpretive, based on Comm3 (298a), which seems to understand
                                    the “five protrusions of the stūpas” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">pañcasphoṭikastūpānām</foreign>) as the five
                                    syllables visualized as blocking the five upper subtle channels
                                    (the “stūpas”). He later specifies the number of these syllables
                                    as eight, but this inconsistency could perhaps be due to the
                                    fact that three of the gates (eyes, ears, and nostrils) require
                                    using the same syllable. Other commentaries identify the “five
                                    protrusions” differently. Comm1 (642–645) and Bu ston
                                    (F.316a.3–4) identify this as the human body, the “protrusions”
                                    being the head, arms, and legs. Bhavabhaṭṭa (Sz 4.3.43cd)
                                    interprets the “five protrusions” (or the “five bursts”) as the
                                    syllable <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">hūṁ</mantra>.
                                    Durjayacandra (f.45v1–2) seems to identify these five as the
                                    five subtle channels with the natures of the five buddhas,
                                    converging at the throat. The “stūpa” is interpreted by all
                                    commentators except Indrabhūti as a location. Comm1 (642–645)
                                    and Bu ston (F. 316a.3–4) identify it as the head, Durjayacandra
                                    (f.45v1–2) as the heart, and Bhavabhaṭṭa (Sz 4.3.43cd) as the
                                    space between the eyebrows. In the Degé (146b.6–7) this
                                    half-stanza reads, “One should visualize the orifices of the

                                    support (or at least not contradict) this reading is Comm3
                                    (299a), where we read, “ ‘The root of the seed of wind’ [is
                                    explained as follows:] ‘root’ refers to the ‘wind of shape’

                                    from the edge to the top.” The remaining commentaries seem to
                                    reflect the reading “the wind is its root,” adopted also by the
                                    Degé edition. Butön (F.316a.3–4) interprets the “syllable of
                                    wind” and its “root” as the beginningless continuity of cause
                                    and effect, rather than their visualized spatial aspects: “ ‘The
                                    root of the seed of wind’ indicates, like [seed, root,] and
                                    sprout, that it comes about from a beginningless continuity of
                                    cause and effect.” Comm2 (1012) says, “ ‘Its root is wind’ means
                                    that the seed syllable <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">hūṁ</mantra> is at the root of the maṇḍala of wind.” Comm1
                                    (643) says, “The seed syllable of wind is <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">yuṁ</mantra>. Since the
                                    root of wind is its (the seed syllable’s) roots, [wind] is
                                    rooted in its seed syllable. This incidentally indicates all
                                    variety of notions, such as seed, sprout, and the rest, in which

                                    (152b.3) and Comm3 (1618). The Tib. reads, “The queen of the
                                    yoga maṇḍala, / And likewise, the exalted vajra lord” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">/rnal ’byor dkyil ’khor rgyal

                                    Comm3 states, “ ‘Great queen’ is wisdom in the form of
                                    Nairātymā. ‘Vajra lord’ is the element of gnosis. The main one
                                        (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prabhu</foreign>) is
                                    Vajrasattva.” The other two commentaries, however, differ in
                                    interpretation. Comm1 (687) has the “great queens,” in the
                                    plural, referring to a few sets of four goddess, such as
                                    “Pukkasī and so forth,” whereas it treats “the vajra ladies”
                                    (instead of “the vajra lord”) also in the plural, as referring
                                    to the four goddesses, “the Horse Faced One,” and so forth.
                                    Comm2 (1027) has this whole verse, including the second two
                                    lines and even the “vajra queen” in the next verse, as referring
                                    to the “five queens of the maṇḍala: the main vajra lady,

                        (the folio numbers with letters indicating either verso or recto have been
                        added in braces), the textual variants have been reported in the critical
                        apparatus only when the reading in C was rejected in favor of another
                        source. In a minority of cases though, the variants were reported even when
                        C was followed, if the rejected readings were deemed significant.</p>

                    <p tid="2235">However, many minor changes have been made without reporting this
                        in the critical apparatus. This applies, <foreign xml:lang="la" type="term">inter alia</foreign>, to the standardization of sibilants and nasal
                        sounds, the doubling of some single consonants (or reducing a double to a
                        single), and many other orthographic and sandhi emendments. Whenever it
                        seemed to have a purpose (as, for example, <foreign xml:lang="la" type="term">metri causa</foreign>, or to follow a convention applying to
                        a particular section of the text), the lack of sandhi was left un-emended,
                        or, inversely, a sandhi was replaced by its absence. The absence of sandhi,
                        most of the time, is indicated by the “bullet” (•).</p>

                    <p tid="2236">As the language of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>
                        varies considerably from part to part in terms of style, grammar, and the
                        extent of BHS influence, somewhat different editorial <term type="ignore">principles</term> were applied in different parts. Thus, e.g., in parts
                        where some BHS forms appeared to be the norm, many such forms have been left
                        in place, resulting in what at a first glance may seem grammatical
                        “anomalies.” On some rare occasions, when the information to go by was
                        insufficient, the erroneous syntactical or other features were left
                        unemended.</p>

                    <p tid="2238">The purpose of the present edition is mainly to support the
                        accompanying translation, and not to serve as a philological study of the
                        text in its own right. To fulfill the latter purpose, some of its obvious
                        shortcomings would need to be remedied.</p>
                    <p tid="2239">One such shortcomings (to mention but a few) is that the relative
                        reliance on different manuscripts varies from part to part. Manuscript R,
                        for example, whose value was realized late in the editorial work, starts
                        featuring prominently in the critical apparatus only toward the end of the
                        first sub-chapter of chapter seven, replacing, in terms of reliance,
                        manuscript T1. However, some readings from R were later added to the
                        preceding chapters as well. </p>

                        emendation was merely cosmetic (such as, e.g., the changing of an anusvara
                        to <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">m</foreign> before vowels), are
                        not always followed by an “<foreign xml:lang="la" type="term">em</foreign>.”

                    <p tid="2241">For those interested in the intertextuality of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sampuṭa</title>, this edition includes markers
                        indicating points of correspondence with parallel passages in some of the
                        source texts. Each marker consists of a siglum followed by chapter and verse
                        numbers, followed by arrows. For example, “Sz 1.2.3d→” would indicate that
                        the corresponding passage is in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Catuṣpīṭha</title>, and begins (right arrow) from the fourth (d) pāda
                        of the third verse of the second part of the first chapter, while the
                        subsequent “Sz 1.2.15b←” would indicate that this passage ends (left arrow)
                        with the second (b) pāda of the fifteenth verse of the same part. When
                        marking prose, the markers do not include the letters indicating pādas (a,
                        b, c, d, and sometimes e and f), but include the word “prose” instead. The
                        markers of prose passages do not specify the precise location, but since the
                        textual units that the numbers refer to are usually short, it will be easy
                        to find the exact points of correspondence in the relevant source texts.</p>
