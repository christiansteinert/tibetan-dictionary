                <p tid="1">The main topic of this sūtra is an explanation of how the Buddha and all things share the very same
                    empty nature. Through a set of similes, the sūtra shows how an illusion-like Buddha may dispense appropriate
                    teachings to sentient beings in accordance with their propensities. His activities are effortless since his
                    realization is free from concepts. Thus, the Tathāgata’s non-conceptual awareness results in great compassion
                    beyond any reference point.</p>

                        hereafter JAA) is of particular significance for its discussion of the nature of a buddha, his appearance
                        to sentient beings, and his beneficial activities. These themes are in turn related to the doctrine of
                        buddha nature (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">tathāgatagarbha</foreign>), important for both
                        general Mahāyāna Buddhism and Secret Mantra. The JAA has even been interpreted as propounding an explicit
                        Vajrayāna perspective of purity, and has been quoted by masters of secret mantra in India, Tibet, and
                        Japan. </p>

                    <p tid="6">Although this sūtra is called “an ornament” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">alaṃkāra</foreign>), it is perhaps rather about an ornament. More literally, <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">alaṃkāra</foreign> means “something that completes,” and according to the
                        conventions of ancient and medieval Indian literature, that is what an ornament should do. Therefore,
                        rather than being a dispensable decoration, the sūtra completes and adorns the light or appearance
                            (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">āloka</foreign>) of a special type of knowledge (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">jñāna</foreign>). This knowledge is a meaningful awareness, not just the
                        awareness of an ordinary object. This awareness can engage with, or descend into (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">avatāra</foreign>), the scope of all buddhas, which is their object or, more
                        precisely, their domain (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">viṣaya</foreign>). If we follow the
                        interpretation of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratna­gotra­vibhāga</title>, the light of awareness is
                        itself the ornament that allows bodhisattvas to descend or enter into the domain of all buddhas.<note place="end" index="2" xml:id="UT22084-047-002-345">

                    <p tid="7">Although texts preserved as sūtra or <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">sūtrānta</foreign> are
                        classified as “Word of the Buddha” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">buddhavacana</foreign>), this
                        does not necessarily mean that the Buddha is the main speaker. For example, the bulk of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Prajñā­pāramitā­hṛdaya</title> (the “<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Heart Sūtra</title>”)
                        consists of a dialogue between the venerable Śāriputra and the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. In the present
                        sūtra, however, Buddha Śākyamuni is not only there to offer a seal of approval but is, in effect, the main
                        speaker. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-047-002-7"/>
                    <p tid="8">The sūtra locates its teaching in Rājgir, on the mountain of Vulture Peak. Although this is also
                        the place where many of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prajñāpāramitā</title> teachings are set, the Buddha
                        is here dwelling in the Womb of the Dharmadhātu Palace. The symbolism is perhaps more attuned to the third
                        turning of the <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dharmacakra</foreign>, taking place in a variety of
                        locations and teaching a wide array of advanced topics. </p>
                    <p tid="9">The teaching does not take place within the ordinary appearance of our world sphere. Just before
                        the Buddha sits on his lion throne, the entire environment is transformed into the purest gold and jewels.
                        Such emphasis on the purified appearance of the environment of the sūtra may be significant in the light
                        of its more esoteric interpretations. </p>

                    <p tid="10">The audience is made up of two kinds of individual: hearers who have already become arhats, and
                        bodhisattvas who are close to buddhahood, i.e., on the tenth or last level (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">bhūmi</foreign>), called “Cloud of Dharma.” The hearers are headed by
                        Ājñāta­kauṇḍinya; his name means “Kauṇḍinya who understood,” and he is described in other sūtras as the
                        first monk to have been praised by the Buddha for having understood his teaching. The bodhisattvas are
                        headed by Mañjuśrī, the embodiment of wisdom or higher knowledge, who is also the main interlocutor of
                        this sūtra. </p>

                    <p tid="11">The Buddha signals that an exceptional teaching will take place through a <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prātihārya</foreign>, an extraordinary display of light meant to attract audiences
                        from very far away. <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Prātihārya</foreign> is sometimes translated as
                        “miracle,” but rather than being an inexplicable testimony of divine intervention, <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prātihāryas</foreign> are classified in Mahāyāna scholasticism as a means to draw
                        the listeners’ attention, and to instill reverence toward what is going to be taught. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-047-002-10"/>
                    <p tid="12">If we follow Buddhist cosmology and cosmogony, the appearance of a buddha may be understood as an
                        exceptional event, resulting from a myriad of positive causal concomitances. Each buddha conforms to
                        specific cosmic regularities, due to inner causal factors (his aspirations during countless previous
                        lives) and outer ones (the collective merit of sentient beings); and each buddha arises within a specific
                        area of the universe, called a “buddhafield” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">buddhakṣetra</foreign>). This will be the field of activity of one, and only one, buddha—at least in
                        the sense that only one buddha will enact the specific set of activities that, just as the sun cannot
                        avoid shining, no buddha can avoid performing. Certain teachings will be taught by all the buddhas; the
                        jeweled throne that appears and invites Buddha Śākyamuni to sit and teach suggests that this is, indeed,
                        one of those recurrent teachings. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-047-002-11"/>
                    <p tid="13">Infinite buddhafields may exist at the same time. Mahāyāna sūtras often specify that diligent and
                        wise bodhisattvas can perceive and even visit other buddhafields, paying their respects and obtaining
                        teachings from the buddhas residing there. In this sūtra, after Buddha Śākyamuni emits light that fills
                        the entire trichiliocosm, a very large number of bodhisattvas arrive from other buddhafields—suggesting
                        once more the importance of the teaching about to be given. </p>
                    <p tid="14"> Mañjuśrī is the bodhisattva associated with wisdom (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prajñā</foreign>).<note place="end" index="3" xml:id="UT22084-047-002-346"><!--KB-->It is by now common to
                            translate <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prajñā</foreign> as “wisdom,” and more precise
                            alternatives (such as “superior cognition”) may appear cumbersome or odd. However, it is useful to
                            keep in mind that <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prajñā</foreign> is also a synonym for
                                <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">abhidharma</foreign> (a higher understanding of the
                            dharmas), <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dharma­pravicaya</foreign> (the grouping or analysis
                            of the dharmas), and of <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vipaśyanā</foreign> (special insight
                            into the nature of things). This also helps explain the sūtra’s interest in discrete classifications,
                            especially in the last sections.</note> The JAA’s thematic focus on wisdom and the <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prajñāpāramitā</foreign> is quite clear: Mañjuśrī begins by asking the
                        Buddha about the meaning of non-arising and non-cessation. </p>

                        sentience, defined as the perception of objects. Mañjuśrī most consistently praises the Buddha for the
                        lack of that perception. The section on the nature of awakening concludes with several verses extolling
                        Śākyamuni Buddha as “you who are free of any point of reference” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">nirālamba</foreign>). Freedom from point of reference is <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">jñāna</foreign> rather than <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vijñāna</foreign>; it is not mind
                        or conventions (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">buddhi</foreign> or <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">saṃvṛti</foreign>). Mañjuśrī is asked by the Buddha to rely on <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">jñāna</foreign>, and he responds to the teachings with an extensive praise of its
                        nature. This section is therefore related to the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Laṅkāvatāra</title>’s explicit

                        Kangyur. In several instances the Tibetan proved useful by offering more complete readings. Hence, we have
                        at times followed the Tibetan rather than the Sanskrit reading. On occasion, we have also consulted
                        Kimura’s transliteration of the Sanskrit manuscript (GRETIL version, 2004) and reverted to its readings.
                        For the most part, the Tibetan follows the Sanskrit closely, although in a few instances it appears to be
                        based on a different manuscript tradition. This is certainly plausible if the proposed date of the
                        Sanskrit manuscript (11th–13th century) is correct, since the Tibetan translation was produced centuries

                        basis: the peaceful basis. That which is peaceful is very peaceful. That which is very peaceful is utterly
                        peaceful. That which is utterly peaceful is utter pacification; utter pacification is called the sage.
                        Thus, Mañjuśrī, just like space, so is awakening. Just like awakening, so are the dharmas. Just like the
                        dharmas, so are sentient beings. Just like sentient beings, so are the fields. Just like the fields, so is
                        nirvāṇa. Therefore, Mañjuśrī, it is said that all dharmas are the same as nirvāṇa. Since this is their
                        ultimate mode, there is no counteragent. Because there is no counteragent, they are primordially pure,
                        primordially stainless, and primordially without disturbances. It is thus, Mañjuśrī, that the Tathāgata
                        realized all dharmas to be; as he observes the sphere of sentient beings, a pure, great compassion that is
                        free from disturbances, called play, comes about toward those sentient beings. <ref cRef="134" type="sanskrit"/>

                        destruction; and conforming to destruction is the destruction of nothing whatsoever. And that, wherein
                        there is no destruction of anything whatsoever, is unproduced. With respect to the unproduced, there is no
