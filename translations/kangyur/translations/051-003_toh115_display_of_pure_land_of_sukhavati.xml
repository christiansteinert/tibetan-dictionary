                    disciple Śāriputra a detailed description of the realm of Sukhāvatī, a delightful, enlightened abode, free of
                    suffering. Its inhabitants are described as mature beings in an environment where everything enhances their
                    spiritual inclinations. The principal buddha of Sukhāvatī is addressed as Amitāyus (Limitless Life) as well as
                    Amitābha (Limitless Light). </p>
                <p tid="2">Buddha Śākyamuni further explains how virtuous people who focus single-mindedly on Buddha Amitābha will
                    obtain a rebirth in Sukhāvatī in their next life, and he urges all to develop faith in this teaching. In
                    support, he cites the similar way in which the various buddhas of the six directions exhort their followers to
                    develop confidence in this teaching on Sukhāvatī. </p>
                <p tid="3">The sūtra ends with a short dialogue between Śāriputra and Buddha Śākyamuni that highlights the
                    difficulty of enlightened activity in a degenerate age. </p>

                        that expound the Land of Delight, the pure realm of Amitābha, called Sukhāvatī. The Kangyur includes
                        Tibetan translations of two of these texts: this one, often called the “shorter” <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sukhāvatī</title>, and the “longer” sūtra, with the formal title <title xml:lang="en">The Array of Amitābha</title> (Toh 49 in the Heap of Jewels section).<note place="end" index="1" xml:id="UT22084-051-003-169">Toh 49 (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’od dpag med kyi bkod pa’i mdo</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Amitābha­vyūha­sūtra</foreign>), also known in Tibetan as <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bde ba can gyi zhing  bkod pa’i bstan pa</title> (<title xml:lang="en">The Teaching on the Display of the Pure Land  of Sukhāvatī</title>) or, informally, the “longer” <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sukhāvatī</title>.</note> The third, <title xml:lang="en">The Amitāyus Meditation Sūtra</title>,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-051-003-145" index="2">The latter sūtra’s

                            fabricated at a later date. Most scholars even consider the <title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Guan wu liang
                                shou jing</title> to be a Chinese or Central Asian compilation. See Fujita (1990), especially p.
                            155 and n. 48, on the question of the title. On p. 155 Fujita says: “It cannot be determined

                        only one Tibetan version, translated in the eighth or ninth century. The Chinese versions of the sūtra
                        spread through China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam and played an important role in the formation of the Pure
                        Land schools in these countries. These versions appear to embellish the description of the wonders of the

                        whereas the Tibetan version is more subdued and shows its main variations from the Sanskrit original in
                        the names and the number of buddhas presiding over the different buddha realms. The various editions in
                        the Tibetan canon, i.e., the Degé, Narthang, Peking, and Lhasa editions, show no major differences that
                        would alter the meaning. </p>

                        realms, we have retained their original Sanskrit names, unless the Tibetan text had names without a known
                        Sanskrit equivalent, in which case we chose to translate those names into English. The differences are

                        and arhats, and engage exclusively in wholesome activities. The principal buddha of this realm has two
                        names, Amitāyus (Limitless Life) and Amitābha (Limitless Light). Even though it is not explicitly stated
                        in this particular sūtra, Amitāyus is, in Vajrayāna contexts, sometimes considered a sambhogakāya form of
                        Buddha Amitābha.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-051-003-149" index="6">But see also Roberts and Bower

                        jewels, with magical birds, and with little bells producing lovely sounds. Its ideal environment enhances

                    <p tid="15">The narrative of the sūtra takes place in the Jeta Grove of Śrāvastī, where Buddha Śākyamuni, in
                        the presence of a large audience consisting of arhats and bodhisattvas, addresses his disciple Śāriputra
                        and tells him about the realm of Sukhāvatī. The sūtra is in large part a discourse spoken by the Buddha.
                        Even though the Buddha regularly asks the question, “Śāriputra, what do you think about this?” Śāriputra
                        speaks only at the very end of the sūtra and praises the Buddha.</p>
                    <p tid="16">The sūtra ends with a short dialogue between Śāriputra and Buddha Śākyamuni that highlights the
                        difficulty of Buddha Śākyamuni’s attaining enlightenment and preaching in a degenerate age.</p>

                    <p tid="17">The notion of innumerable buddha realms coexisting with our reality became popular with the
                        emergence of Mahāyāna Buddhism around the first century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. They have been interchangeably translated as
                        buddhafields, buddha realms, or pure lands.</p>
                    <p tid="18">In <title xml:lang="en">The Display of the Pure Land of Sukhāvatī</title>, the Land of Delight is
                        described as a realm beyond space and time. The two larger sūtras elaborate on the history of its
                        emergence. According to those sūtras, the Land of Delight is the result of the powerful vows of Buddha
                        Amitābha, who out of great compassion created a safe environment for fortunate beings to progress toward
                        spiritual maturity. The smaller sūtra, however, refers only to the existence of such a realm and its
                        characteristics.</p>
                    <p tid="19">In the sūtra, Buddha Śākyamuni explains the manner in which beings take birth in this realm:
                        fortunate sons and daughters are told to accumulate a significant amount of merit and direct their faith
                        single-mindedly toward Buddha Amitābha.</p>
                    <p tid="20">Śākyamuni’s discourse mentions an alternative title for this sūtra. He explains that there are
