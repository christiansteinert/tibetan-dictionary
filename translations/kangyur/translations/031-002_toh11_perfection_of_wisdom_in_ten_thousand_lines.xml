                <p tid="1">While dwelling at Vulture Peak near Rāja­gṛha, the Buddha sets in <term type="ignore">motion</term> the
                    sūtras that are the most extensive of all—the sūtras on the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Prajñā­pāramitā</title>,
                    or “Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom.” Committed to writing around the start of the first millennium, these
                    sūtras were expanded and contracted in the centuries that followed, eventually amounting to twenty-three
                    volumes in the Tibetan Kangyur. Among them, <title xml:lang="en">The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten
                        Thousand Lines</title> is a compact and coherent restatement of the longer versions, uniquely extant in
                    Tibetan translation, without specific commentaries, and rarely studied. While the structure generally follows
                    that of the longer versions, chapters 1–2 conveniently summarize all three hundred and sixty-seven categories
                    of phenomena, causal and fruitional attributes which the sūtra examines in the <term type="ignore">light</term> of wisdom or discriminative awareness. Chapter 31 and the final chapter 33 conclude with an
                    appraisal of <term>irreversible bodhisattvas</term>, the pitfalls of rejecting this teaching, and the
                    blessings that accrue from committing it to writing.</p>

                    <p tid="3">The Tibetan Buddhist tradition classifies the discourses delivered by Buddha Śākyamuni in terms of
                        the three turnings of the doctrinal wheel, promulgated at different places and times in the course of his
                            <term type="ignore">life</term>. Among them, the sūtras of the first turning expound the four noble
                        truths, those of the second turning explain emptiness and the essenceless nature of all phenomena, while
                        those of the third turning elaborate further distinctions between the three essenceless natures.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-031-002-4" index="1"><!--KB-->On the distinctions between the three promulgations,
                            see Jamgon Kongtrul’s concise <term type="ignore">explanation</term> in TOK Book 5, pp. 145–156. The three essenceless natures,

                    <p tid="4">It is in these sūtras that the role of the compassionate bodhisattva with a mind set upon
                        enlightenment achieves preeminence over the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas of lesser attainment.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-031-002-8" index="4"> The setting of the mind on enlightenment (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bodhi­cittotpāda</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">byang chub sems su bskyed pa</foreign>) for the sake of all sentient beings, which marks the
                            onset of the bodhisattva path and culminates in the actual attainment of buddhahood, distinguishes the
                            compassionate bodhisattva path from that of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas who are both preoccupied
                            with their own emancipation from cyclic existence. See Dayal (1932): 50–79, Williams (1989): 197–204,
                            and Padmakara Translation Group (1994): 218–234. The śrāvakas are pious attendants who listen to the
                            teachings that the buddhas taught by word of mouth, and place great emphasis on destroying the
                            mistaken belief in personal identity (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pudgala</foreign>,
                                <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">gang zag</foreign>) by overcoming all afflicted mental
                            states. In the course of determining their own emancipation from cyclic existence, they may achieve in
                            succession the fruit of entering the stream to nirvāṇa, the fruit of being tied to only one more
                            rebirth, the fruit of being no longer subject to rebirth, and the fruit of arhatship. By contrast, the
                            pratyekabuddhas are hermit buddhas who pursue their path to individual enlightenment in solitude or in
                            small groups, without relying on a teacher and without communicating their understanding to others.
                            Following a natural predisposition for meditation through which they <term type="ignore">comprehend</term> the twelve links of
                            dependent origination in forward and reverse order, they are said to surpass the śrāvakas in the sense
                            that they realize the emptiness of external phenomena, composed of atomic particles, in addition to
                            realising the emptiness of personal identity. However, unlike bodhisattvas, they fail to realize that
                            the internal phenomena of consciousness are also without inherent existence. Only the bodhisattvas
                            resolve to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood or omniscience, in order to benefit all sentient
                            beings.</note> The central message subtly integrates relative truth and ultimate truth, reiterating
                        that great bodhisattva beings should strive to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in order to eliminate
                        the sufferings of all sentient beings rather than merely terminate cyclic existence for their own sake,
                        even though, from an ultimate perspective, there are no phenomena, no sentient beings, and no attainment
                        of manifestly perfect buddhahood. </p>

                    <p tid="5">The relentless deconstruction of all conceptual elaborations with respect to phenomena, meditative
                        experiences, and even the causal and fruitional attributes characteristic of the bodhisattva path, which
                        is explicitly emphasized throughout these sūtras, may have been controversial,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-031-002-10" index="5">The sūtras themselves frequently allude to proponents of the Vinaya and to
                            upholders of the lesser vehicles (śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas) who would have balked at their
                            unrelenting deconstruction of phenomena and buddha attributes, and sought to oppose them. See, for
                            example, <ptr target="#UT22084-031-002-2689"/>.</note> but it has given rise to both Madhyamaka
                        dialectics and to the non-analytical meditative pursuits of the Chan (Zen) tradition. In Tibet, on the
                        other hand, the sūtras are generally approached through <term type="ignore">study</term> of <title xml:lang="en">The Ornament of
                            Clear Realization</title> and its extensive commentaries, which constitute the Parchin (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phar phyin</foreign>) literature—one of the principal subjects of the
                        monastic college curriculum. These treatises elaborate on the eightfold structural progression of the
                        bodhisattvas’ goals, paths, and fruit which are implied, though understated, in all but the recast
                        manuscript of the <title xml:lang="en">Sūtra in Twenty-five Thousand Lines</title>.</p>

                        in Kharoṣṭhī script, which was, by all accounts, retrieved from a stone case in the Bajaur region of the

                        Aparaśaila schools of the Mahāsaṅghika order, where the monasteries of Amarāvati and Dhānyakataka each
                        seems to have preserved a version in Prakrit. Other evidence, not least the survival of the Kharoṣṭhī
                        manuscript segments from Bajaur, suggests, on the contrary, that the sūtras were first committed to
                        writing in the northwest. The epigraphic research of Richard Salomon at the University of Washington tends
                        toward the latter view. The Arapacana alphabet found in some of the longer sūtras as a mnemonic
                        incantation follows the order of letters and peculiarities of the Kharoṣṭhī script.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-031-002-19" index="9">Salomon (1990): 255–273.</note> Furthermore, the earliest

                    <p tid="19">The pioneering Norwegian Indologist Sten Konow is the only academic to have given serious
                        consideration to our text in his 1941 monograph, which includes a Sanskrit reconstruction and translation
                        of the first two chapters. These particular chapters are of great interest because they conveniently draw
                        together the enumerations of the three hundred and sixty-seven aspects of phenomena, meditative
                        experiences, causal and fruitional attributes, and attainments that form the critique of the sūtras. Konow
                        (1941: 70) compares the list of these phenomena and attributes to those found in other sūtras within the
                        cycle and in other Mahāyāna texts. In particular, with regard to the unusual listing of only seventy-eight
                        minor marks, rather than eighty, he speculates that <title xml:lang="en">The Ten Thousand Lines</title>
                        “may represent an earlier attempt,” predating the enumerations found in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­vastu</title>, <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Lalita­vistara</title>, and <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­vyutpatti</title>, which all appear to have a common source. </p>

                                        with respect to all phenomena, all meditative experiences, all causal attributes acquired
                                        by bodhisattvas, all fruitional attributes manifested by buddhas, and all attainments up
                                        to and including omniscience. along with unconditioned phenomena, such as the abiding
                                        nature of all things and the finality of existence, these are all attributes with respect
                                        to which a great bodhisattva being should cultivate detachment. Bodhisattvas do perceive
                                        such phenomena distinctly, but only on the relative level; in an ultimate sense they
                                        consider them to be illusory, in the manner of a dream and so forth. </p>

                                        of wisdom is also non-existent, because all phenomena and attributes are without

                                        attained because the transcendent perfection of wisdom does not establish anything at all
                                        in an apprehending manner, not even omniscience. Despite that, bodhisattvas do not
                                        undervalue the transcendent perfection of wisdom. Those who retain it will never be
                                        separated from omniscience. Those who commit it to writing in the form of a book and make
                                        offerings to it will accrue advantages in this life and the next. They will always be
                                        protected, everyone will rejoice in them, and they will be capable of warding off all
                                        refutations. </p>

                                        buddhas, when they see or hear the transcendent perfection of wisdom they will realize it
                                        in a signless, non-dual, and non-focusing manner. All phenomena, causal and fruitional
                                        attributes, and attainments are neither fettered nor liberated, since their natural
                                        expression remains unchanged. All things are pure owing to the indivisible purity of
                                        sentient beings and afflicted mental states. This purity is not subject to affliction due
                                        to the natural luminosity of all phenomena, attributes, and attainments. It is neither
                                        attained nor manifestly realized, and it has not been actualized. Nor is this purity
                                        cognizant of anything, due to the emptiness of inherent existence. The transcendent
                                        perfection of wisdom neither helps nor hinders omniscience and it does not appropriate

                                        intrinsic awareness. The defining characteristic of the six transcendent perfections are

                                        apart from emptiness. All apprehension of phenomena, causal and fruitional attributes, and
                                        attainments constitutes the immaturity of the bodhisattvas. The absence of all
                                        apprehension constitutes the maturity of the bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas who practice
                                        the transcendent perfection of wisdom perceive that all things are gathered within it, but
                                        do not apprehend anything, owing to non-duality. All things are undifferentiated, without
                                        defining characteristics, and subject neither to arising nor cessation. </p>

                                        ordinary people who grasp dreams as reality that all phenomena are <term>empty of notions

                                        are grasped erroneously through the maturation of past actions, what other cause can there
                                        be for their perception of non-entities as entities? Skillful bodhisattvas cause sentient

                                        least to become established in the causal and fruitional attributes. Although all things

                                        They purify the negativity of body, speech, and mind. Seized by great compassion, they may

                            the eight sense fields of mastery originate through engagement with the aforementioned eight aspects

                        ensues when one who perceives inner formlessness regards greater external forms, along with excellent

                            to other Indic sources, see Konow (1941): 57–81, and the reconstructed Sanskrit on pp. 110–112. In
                            fact only seventy-eight minor marks are listed here, in contrast to the standard listings of eighty,
                            which are found in chapter 63 of <title xml:lang="en">The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in One
                                Hundred Thousand Lines</title> (<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Śata­sāhasrikā­prajñā­pāramitā­sūtra</title>), KPD 25: 111–117; in chapter 62 of <title xml:lang="en">The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Twenty-five Thousand Lines</title> (<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Pañca­viṃśatī­sāhasrikā­prajñā­pāramitā­sūtra</title>), KPD 28: 537–543 and
                            Kimura (2006) VI–VIII, pp. 64ff., and in Chapter 73 of <title xml:lang="en">The Transcendent

                            without significant differences in meaning. That standard list of eighty is largely reinterated in the
                                <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhi­samayālaṃkāra</title> and its <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Spuṭārtha</title> commentary, pp. 89–90 (see also Sparham (2012 IV): 90–96 and 257–262; Conze
                            (1975): 661–664; and Tsepak Rigdzin (1986): 165–166). The only differences, other than in the order,
                            between the list given in those three sūtra recensions and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhi­samayālaṃkāra</title> is that the latter combines the <term type="ignore">purity</term> and cleanliness of the body (21

                            (68) with long and extended arms. However, our present text contains many more divergent readings. In
                            fact, twenty-six items of the standard list are missing and several others appear to be combined or
                            else only tentatively identified. About half of them do correspond to the standard <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sphuṭārtha</title> listing, although they are frequently presented in a
                            different order. The Sanskrit terms given in parenthesis generally follow the terminology of <title xml:lang="en">The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Twenty-five Thousand Lines</title> and the
                                <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sphuṭārtha</title>, although Konow’s reconstructions have also been
                            included when the original is unlocatable. This passage may also be compared to that found in Conze
                            (1975): 586–587, which <term type="ignore">struggles</term> to present a clear enumeration of eighty. The following notes 76–146,

                        illusions another. Illusion is itself the applications of mindfulness, and applications of mindfulness are
                        themselves illusion. In the same vein, [all the other causal attributes], up to and including the noble

                        should train as follows: They should not in any respect make assumptions on account of physical forms.
                        They should not make assumptions on account of feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and
                        consciousness. They should not make assumptions on account of the eyes, and similarly, they should not

                        account of sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental phenomena. They should not make asumptions on

                        element of sights. They should not make assumptions on account of the sensory element of visual

                        elements], up to and including the sensory element of mental consciousness. They should not make
                        assumptions on account of the transcendent perfection of generosity. Similarly, they should not make
                        assumptions on account of the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, the transcendent perfection
                        of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of perseverance, the transcendent perfection of meditative
                        concentration, and the transcendent perfection of wisdom. Similarly, they should not make assumptions on

                        absorptions. They should not make assumptions on account of the applications of mindfulness, and in the
                        same vein, <ref cRef="F.78.a"/> they should not make assumptions on account of [all the other causal

                        should not make assumptions even on account of the enlightened mind, the mind that is equal to the

                        of ideation and scrutiny being due to one-pointed mental focus, while the joy and bliss that arise from

                        because blissful and unhappy states of mind have both previously subsided, while equanimity and

                        Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings, abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdom, actualize the

                        the śrāvakas and the levels of the pratyekabuddhas. Nor are they attached to any attributes through which
                        manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment would be attained.
                        Through the adamantine meditative stability that comes from that extrasensory power, they abandon all

                        would appropriate nothing at all, since he had taken reality as his standard and was not attentive to

                        have grasped or anything that he might have relinquished. Since he did not make assumptions about
                        anything, he did not make assumptions even on the basis of nirvāṇa. <ref cRef="cf. Dutt: 134–135" type="sanskrit" rend="hidden"/>

                        rest. On the other hand, the vehicle will come to rest by way of its non-resting. Su­bhūti, just as the
                        expanse of reality neither comes to rest, nor does it not come to rest, similarly, Su­bhūti, the vehicle
                        does not come to rest, nor does it not come to rest. The same refrain should be extensively applied here,

                        If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because the essential nature of the expanse of reality neither comes to
                        rest, nor does it not come to rest. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because the essential nature of the

                        perfection of wisdom sheds light owing to its utter purity. Venerable Lord! I pay homage to the
                        transcendent perfection of wisdom. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom is unsullied by
                        the three world systems. <ref cRef="F.174.b"/> Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom
                        dispels the blindness of afflicted mental states and all false views. Venerable Lord! The transcendent
                        perfection of wisdom has precedence over all branches of enlightenment. Venerable Lord! The transcendent
                        perfection of wisdom secures happiness, distinct from all fears, enmity, and harmful [thoughts or deeds].
                        Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom brings light to all sentient beings so that they
                        might acquire the [five] eyes. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom demonstrates the path
                        to those who are going astray so that they might abandon the two extremes. Venerable Lord! The
                        transcendent perfection of wisdom is omniscience, so that all afflicted mental states and involuntary
                        reincarnation through propensities might be abandoned. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of
                        wisdom is the mother of the bodhisattvas because it generates all the attributes of the buddhas. Venerable
                        Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom is neither produced, nor does it disintegrate, because it is
                        empty of intrinsic defining characteristics. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom
                        abandons cyclic existences because it is neither an enduring state, nor is it perishable. Venerable Lord!
                        The transcendent perfection of wisdom offers protection to those who lack protection because it bestows
                        all that is precious. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom is endowed with the completely

                            lead to the cessation of suffering. The twelve aspects are specifically identified as follows: suffering is this, it can
                            be diagnosed, it has been diagnosed; the origin of suffering is this, it can be abandoned, it has been
                            abandoned; the cessation of suffering is this, it can be verified, it has been verified; the path
                            leading to the cessation of suffering is this, it can be cultivated, and it has been cultivated. The

                        The transcendent perfection of wisdom genuinely displays the essential nature of all things because it is

                        on the vehicle of the bodhisattvas, those who are on the vehicle of the śrāvakas, or those who are on the

                        wisdom. If you ask why, Śāradvatī­putra, it is because this transcendent perfection of wisdom is itself
                        the Teacher. The Teacher is not one thing, and the transcendent perfection of wisdom another. Rather,
                        emptiness is the transcendent perfection of wisdom and the nature of the transcendent perfection of wisdom
                        is empty. It is owing to this transcendent perfection of wisdom that the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely

                        enter a hamlet, town, city, or country without a guide, and they are incapable and inadequate, having no

                        them. Therefore, the tathāgatas are established, intimately dependent on this transcendent perfection of

                        perfect buddhahood would be attained is non-existent and non-apprehensible. If one were to ask why,
                        Venerable Lord, it is because all things are empty of all things, and things are non-existent and
                        non-apprehensible—even those which great bodhisattva beings seek to reduce or enhance, while they dispense
                        generosity, and similarly, maintain ethical discipline, cultivate tolerance, undertake perseverance,
                        become equipoised in meditative concentration, cultivate wisdom, and in the same vein, engage with
                        omniscience, and so forth. Venerable Lord! For these reasons, the unsurpassed, genuinely perfect
                        enlightenment of great bodhisattva beings is easy to bring forth, and it is easy to attain manifestly
                        perfect buddhahood! If one were to ask why, Venerable Lord, it is because physical forms are empty of
                        their own essential nature. Similarly, feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness
                        are empty of their own essential nature. In the same vein, <ref cRef="F.262.b"/> [all other phenomena,

                    <p tid="2353">Then, Senior Śāradvatī­putra addressed Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Senior Su­bhūti, it is for
                        this very reason that the unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment of the bodhisattvas is extremely
                        hard to bring forth, and it is extremely hard to attain manifestly perfect enlightenment. Just as space
                        does not entertain the thought, ‘I must attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely
                        perfect enlightenment,’ in the same way, Senior Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings also do not entertain
                        the thought, ‘I should attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect
                        enlightenment!’ If you ask why, Senior Su­bhūti, it is because all things are equal to space. Once great
                        bodhisattva beings accept that all things resemble space, they will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood
                        in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. Senior Su­bhūti, if, once great bodhisattva beings accept
                        that all things resemble space, it were easy for them to bring forth unsurpassed, genuinely perfect
                        enlightenment, and it were easy to attain manifestly perfect enlightenment, and it were not hard to bring
                        this forth, and not hard to attain manifestly perfect enlightenment, then great bodhisattva beings,
                        numerous as the sands of the River Ganges, who don the armor, would not regress from unsurpassed,
                        genuinely perfect enlightenment. For this reason, Senior Su­bhūti, it is clear that unsurpassed, genuinely
                        perfect enlightenment is extremely hard to bring forth, and it is hard to attain manifestly perfect
                        enlightenment.” <ref cRef="cf. Kimura IV: 130–131" type="sanskrit" rend="hidden"/>

                        to the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas, they also give religious robes, alms, bedding,
                        medicines to cure the sick, and necessities to śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. They give flowers, garlands,
                        perfume, unguents, powders, parasols, victory banners, ribbons, butter, grain-seed oils, and <term type="ignore">lamps</term>. Just

                        toward those of degenerate morality. In the same way they dispense generosity toward human beings, and
                        likewise they dispense generosity toward non-human beings. They do not discriminate between those who are
                        worthy recipients and those who are unworthy. Rather, they dispense their generosity, having <term type="ignore">established</term>
                        the notion that all sentient beings are undifferentiated. If you ask why, since they realize that all
                        things are undifferentiated, having comprehended and actualized this, they dispense generosity that is
                        undifferentiated, and so they attain that which is undifferentiated—that is to say, omniscience. <ref cRef="cf. Kimura                         VI–VIII: 47–48" type="sanskrit" rend="hidden"/>

                        from the notions of feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness are reckoned to be

                        fields; the notions of desire, hatred, and delusion; the notion of the sixty-two aspects of false

                        the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, the notion of the levels of the śrāvakas and
                        pratyekabuddhas, and the notion of the [attainments], up to and including omniscience, are all reckoned to

                        irreversible have entered upon the maturity of the bodhisattvas with respect to all phenomena, which are
                        empty of intrinsic defining characteristics. They apprehend nothing at all, even to the extent of an
                        indivisible atomic particle, and because they do not apprehend anything at all, they do not condition
                        anything at all. Because they do not condition anything at all, they do not produce anything at all.
                        Therefore, great bodhisattva beings, who have accepted that phenomena are non-arising, are revealed to be
                        irreversible. <ref cRef="cf. Kimura IV: 152–153" type="sanskrit" rend="hidden"/>

                                suitable term of address for himself. See, e.g., Dudjom Rinpoche 1991: 423). <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Āyuṣmān</foreign> may imply one who has held monastic ordination for

                                to cyclic existence, in contrast to the buddhas, who are “immortal.” Even today Thai monks

                            <term type="definition">Nirvāṇa, the state beyond sorrow, denotes the ultimate attainment of
                                buddhahood, the permanent cessation of all suffering and the afflicted mental states which cause
                                and perpetuate suffering, along with all misapprehension with regard to the nature of emptiness.
                                As such, it is the antithesis of cyclic existence. Three types of nirvāṇa are identified: (1) the
                                residual nirvāṇa where the person is still dependent on conditioned psycho-physical aggregates,
                                (2) the non-residual nirvāṇa where the aggregates have also been consumed within
                                emptiness, and (3) the non-abiding nirvāṇa transcending the extremes of phenomenal existence and
                                quiescence. <term type="ignore">Final nirvāṇa</term> implies the non-residual attainment.</term>

                                (Dayal 1932: 136) and not as an abstract “body of knowledge,” or in any aloof and mysterious
