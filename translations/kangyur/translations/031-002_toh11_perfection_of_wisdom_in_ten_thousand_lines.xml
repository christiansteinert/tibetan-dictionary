                <p tid="1">While dwelling at Vulture Peak near Rāja­gṛha, the Buddha sets in <term type="ignore">motion</term> the sūtras that are the most extensive of
                    all—the sūtras on the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Prajñā­pāramitā</title>, or
                    “Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom.” Committed to writing around the start of
                    the first millennium, these sūtras were expanded and contracted in the centuries
                    that followed, eventually amounting to twenty-three volumes in the Tibetan
                    Kangyur. Among them, <title xml:lang="en">The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom
                        in Ten Thousand Lines</title> is a compact and coherent restatement of the
                    longer versions, uniquely extant in Tibetan translation, without specific
                    commentaries, and rarely studied. While the structure generally follows that of
                    the longer versions, chapters 1–2 conveniently summarize all three hundred and
                    sixty-seven categories of phenomena, causal and fruitional attributes which the
                    sūtra examines in the <term type="ignore">light</term> of wisdom or
                    discriminative awareness. Chapter 31 and the final chapter 33 conclude with an
                    appraisal of <term>irreversible bodhisattvas</term>, the pitfalls of rejecting
                    this teaching, and the blessings that accrue from committing it to writing.</p>

                        Buddha Śākyamuni in terms of the three turnings of the doctrinal wheel,
                        promulgated at different places and times in the course of his <term type="ignore">life</term>. Among them, the sūtras of the first turning
                        expound the four noble truths, those of the second turning explain emptiness
                        and the essenceless nature of all phenomena, while those of the third
                        turning elaborate further distinctions between the three essenceless

                    <p tid="4">It is in these sūtras that the role of the compassionate bodhisattva
                        with a mind set upon enlightenment achieves preeminence over the śrāvakas
                        and pratyekabuddhas of lesser attainment.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-031-002-8" index="4"> The setting of the mind on

                            sentient beings, which marks the onset of the bodhisattva path and
                            culminates in the actual attainment of buddhahood, distinguishes the
                            compassionate bodhisattva path from that of the śrāvakas and
                            pratyekabuddhas who are both preoccupied with their own emancipation
                            from cyclic existence. See Dayal (1932): 50–79, Williams (1989):
                            197–204, and Padmakara Translation Group (1994): 218–234. The śrāvakas
                            are pious attendants who listen to the teachings that the buddhas taught
                            by word of mouth, and place great emphasis on destroying the mistaken
                            belief in personal identity (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pudgala</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">gang
                                zag</foreign>) by overcoming all afflicted mental states. In the
                            course of determining their own emancipation from cyclic existence, they
                            may achieve in succession the fruit of entering the stream to nirvāṇa,
                            the fruit of being tied to only one more rebirth, the fruit of being no
                            longer subject to rebirth, and the fruit of arhatship. By contrast, the
                            pratyekabuddhas are hermit buddhas who pursue their path to individual

                        all sentient beings rather than merely terminate cyclic existence for their

                        to have given serious consideration to our text in his 1941 monograph, which
                        includes a Sanskrit reconstruction and translation of the first two
                        chapters. These particular chapters are of great interest because they
                        conveniently draw together the enumerations of the three hundred and
                        sixty-seven aspects of phenomena, meditative experiences, causal and
                        fruitional attributes, and attainments that form the critique of the sūtras.
                        Konow (1941: 70) compares the list of these phenomena and attributes to
                        those found in other sūtras within the cycle and in other Mahāyāna texts. In

                                        experiences, all causal attributes acquired by bodhisattvas,

                                        and dispels the blindness of afflicted mental states and all
                                        false views owing to its utter purity. It secures happiness,
                                        demonstrating the path to those who go astray. It is
                                        omniscience, the mother of bodhisattvas, because it
                                        generates all buddha attributes. Just as the blind cannot
                                        get around without a guide, the five other transcendent
                                        perfections have no scope to attain omniscience unguided by
                                        the transcendent perfection of wisdom. Yet, this
                                        transcendent perfection of wisdom is actualized owing to the
                                        non-actualization of all things because they are
                                        non-arising, non-apprehensible, and do not disintegrate.
                                        Nothing at all will be attained because the transcendent
                                        perfection of wisdom does not establish anything at all in
                                        an apprehending manner, not even omniscience. Despite that,
                                        bodhisattvas do not undervalue the transcendent perfection
                                        of wisdom. Those who retain it will never be separated from
                                        omniscience. Those who commit it to writing in the form of a
                                        book and make offerings to it will accrue advantages in this
                                        life and the next. They will always be protected, everyone
                                        will rejoice in them, and they will be capable of warding
                                        off all refutations. </p>

                                        made offerings to innumerable buddhas, when they see or hear

                                        are neither fettered nor liberated, since their natural
                                        expression remains unchanged. All things are pure owing to
                                        the indivisible purity of sentient beings and afflicted
                                        mental states. This purity is not subject to affliction due
                                        to the natural luminosity of all phenomena, attributes, and
                                        attainments. It is neither attained nor manifestly realized,
                                        and it has not been actualized. Nor is this purity cognizant
                                        of anything, due to the emptiness of inherent existence. The

                                        but that is not the case in ultimate reality. For instance,

                                        comprehensibility, conditioning, and particularizing
                                        intrinsic awareness. The defining characteristic of the six

                                        aggregates which are dreamlike, without essential nature,
                                        and without defining characteristics. They perfect all
                                        meditative experiences and all causal and fruitional
                                        attributes, and then, participating in cyclic existence for
                                        the sake of all sentient beings, they are untainted by the
                                        defects of cyclic existence. Understanding that all things
                                        are without defining characteristics, they go on to attain
                                        omniscience. Owing to the emptiness of essential nature and
                                        the emptiness of ultimate reality, they do not conceptualize
                                        and they come to accept that phenomena are non-arising.

                                        apprehend anything at all apart from emptiness. All
                                        apprehension of phenomena, causal and fruitional attributes,
                                        and attainments constitutes the immaturity of the
                                        bodhisattvas. The absence of all apprehension constitutes
                                        the maturity of the bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas who
                                        practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom perceive that
                                        all things are gathered within it, but do not apprehend
                                        anything, owing to non-duality. All things are
                                        undifferentiated, without defining characteristics, and
                                        subject neither to arising nor cessation. </p>

                                        perfections, they attract sentient beings and establish them
                                        on the bodhisattva levels, releasing them from erroneous
                                        views. When the relative truth is taken as the standard,
                                        they systematically present the various fruits, but not so
                                        in ultimate truth because all things are without arising,
                                        without cessation, without affliction and without
                                        purification. This reality of emptiness is non-conceptual
                                        and indescribable. Owing to emptiness, they do not become
                                        fixated on anything at all, and they do not train in
                                        anything except emptiness, signlessness and
                                        aspirationlessness. In this way they undertake
                                        training—realizing the four noble truths, comprehending the
                                        twelve links of dependent origination, and refining the
                                        causal and fruitional attributes. </p>

                                        bubble of water, perceptions resemble a mirage, formative

                                        illusionist. The defining characteristic of suffering is

                                        is production, the defining characteristic of cessation is

                                        expanse of reality; and yet, owing to their skill in means,
                                        they continue to practice the transcendent perfections and
                                        encourage others to do so. If all things were not empty of
                                        inherent existence, the bodhisattvas would not demonstrate
                                        to sentient beings that all things are empty of inherent
                                        existence. The emptiness of inherent existence is the
                                        natural expression of all things. Abiding therein, they
                                        strive toward genuinely perfect enlightenment, training in
                                        order to liberate sentient beings. Having perfected those

                                        from the causal and fruitional attributes. They do not cause
                                        others to doubt the discipline of the sacred doctrine, nor
                                        do they maintain a sense of supremacy. They will not be
                                        disadvantaged and they will always practice the transcendent
                                        perfections, cultivating them for the sake of sentient
                                        beings and dedicating their merits without apprehending
                                        anything. Their physical, verbal, and mental actions are
                                        gentle, without hostility toward any sentient being, and
                                        imbued with loving kindness. Entering into the maturity of
                                        the bodhisattvas, they never cultivate thoughts of
                                        miserliness, degenerate morality, indolence, distraction, or
                                        delusion. If Māra seeks to deceive and dissuade them by
                                        conjuring up negative images of bodhisattvas suffering in
                                        the hells, or by denouncing the bodhisattva path as a poetic
                                        fabrication, their minds will not be alienated and they will
                                        not turn back from genuinely perfect enlightenment. </p>

                                        Among the transcendent perfections and the causal and

                            (1986): 165–166). The only differences, other than in the order, between
                            the list given in those three sūtra recensions and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhi­samayālaṃkāra</title> is that the latter

                        transcendent perfection of wisdom accordingly have minds that are equal to
                        the unequaled and that are not shared in common with the śrāvakas and
                        pratyekabuddhas. Because this mind [of the bodhisattvas] is non-perceptual,
                        it does not make assumptions, and it does not become fixated.” <ref cRef="cf. Dutt: 174–175" type="sanskrit" rend="hidden"/>

                        who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should train as follows:
                        They should not in any respect make assumptions on account of physical
                        forms. They should not make assumptions on account of feelings, perceptions,
                        formative predispositions, and consciousness. They should not make
                        assumptions on account of the eyes, and similarly, they should not make
                        assumptions on account of the ears, the nose, the tongue, the body, and the
                        mental faculty. They should not make assumptions on account of sights, and
                        similarly, they should not make assumptions on account of sounds, odors,
                        tastes, tangibles, and mental phenomena. They should not make asumptions on
                        account of the sensory element of the eyes. They should not make assumptions
                        on account of the sensory element of sights. They should not make
                        assumptions on account of the sensory element of visual consciousness. And
                        in the same vein, they should not make assumptions on account of [all the
                        other sensory elements], up to and including the sensory element of mental
                        consciousness. They should not make assumptions on account of the
                        transcendent perfection of generosity. Similarly, they should not make
                        assumptions on account of the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline,
                        the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of
                        perseverance, the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration, and
                        the transcendent perfection of wisdom. Similarly, they should not make
                        assumptions on account of the meditative concentrations, the immeasurable

                        tangibles, and mental phenomena. They should not abide in visual
                        consciousness, and they should not abide in [the other aspects of
                        consciousness], up to and including mental consciousness. In the same vein,

                        compounded, and they should not abide in [the other aspects of feelings], up
                        to and including feelings due to sensory contact that is mentally
                        compounded. They should not abide in the earth element. They should not
                        abide in the water element, the fire element, and the wind element. They

                            be cultivated, and it has been cultivated. The three times at which the
                            wheel of the sacred doctrine is turned denote the past, present, and

                        transcendent perfection of wisdom another. Rather, emptiness is the
                        transcendent perfection of wisdom and the nature of the transcendent
                        perfection of wisdom is empty. It is owing to this transcendent perfection
                        of wisdom that the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas are

                        transcendent perfection of wisdom is instructive because consciousness [and
                        the other aggregates] are unseen when there is no consciousness arising that

                        Similarly, it indicates to these worlds that the four applications of

                        know that they are approaching unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment.
                        If you ask why, it is because even though those great bodhisattva beings may
                        have dispensed generosity from the time when they first began to set their
                        mind on enlightenment, they have not conceptualized it. Even though they may
                        have maintained ethical discipline, they have not conceptualized it. Even
                        though they may have cultivated tolerance, they have not conceptualized it.
                        Even though they may have undertaken perseverance, they have not
                        conceptualized it. Even though they may have become equipoised in meditative
                        concentration, they have not conceptualized it. Even though they may have
                        cultivated wisdom, they have not conceptualized it. Indeed, they have not
                        conceptualized the ethical discipline of the lord buddhas of the past,
                        future, and present, nor their meditative stability, wisdom, liberation, or
                        perception of liberating pristine cognition. Śāradvatī­putra, those who,
                        with a mind free from conceptualization, dispense generosity, maintain
                        ethical discipline, cultivate tolerance, undertake perseverance, become
                        equipoised in meditative concentration, and, in the same vein, practice in

                            and abides in the sense field of infinite consciousness, thinking,
                            ‘Consciousness is infinite.’</term> The sixth aspect of liberation
                        ensues when the sense field of infinite consciousness has been completely

                        of nothing-at-all, thinking, ‘There is nothing at all.’ The seventh aspect

                        completely transcended in all respects, and one achieves and abides in the

                        become fixated on anything at all. If you ask why, it is because, owing to
                        the emptiness of essential nature, they have no fixation on anything since
                        all things lack any essential nature by which they would become fixated,
                        upon which they would become fixated, or which would become fixated.
                        Consequently, great bodhisattva beings practice the path of perfect
                        enlightenment, but do not abide in anything at all. Indeed they abide in a
                        non-abiding manner. They practice the transcendent perfection of generosity
                        but they do not abide therein. Similarly, they practice the transcendent

                        they do not abide therein. They become equipoised in the first meditative

                        ask why, it is because [the first] meditative concentration is empty of its
                        essential nature, while those who become absorbed in it are also empty, and
                        the aspects [of it] through which they [become absorbed] are also empty. The
                        same applies to [all the other meditative concentrations], up to and

                        Similarly, they attain individual enlightenment, but they do not abide
                        therein. If you ask why, there are two reasons: those fruits are without
                        essential nature, and they themselves are not satisfied merely by abiding
                        therein. Indeed, they think, ‘I should not attain the fruit of entering the

                                Śrāvakas are said to expound the doctrine of selflessness only in
                                terms of the absence of personal identity, while pratyekabuddhas
                                additionally realize the emptiness of external phenomena, composed
                                of atomic particles. However, unlike bodhisattvas they do not
                                realize that the internal phenomena of consciousness too are without
                                inherent existence.</term>

                                that nothing exists independently of other factors, the reason for
                                this being that things and events come into existence only by
                                dependence on the aggregation of multiple causes and <term type="ignore">conditions</term>. In general, the processes of

                                beings within it revolve in a continuous cycle of suffering,
                                propelled by the propensities of past actions and their interaction
                                with afflicted mental states, originate dependent on the sequential
                                unfolding of twelve links, commencing from fundamental ignorance and
                                ending with birth, aging, and death (see <ptr target="#UT22084-031-002-155"/>–<ptr target="#UT22084-031-002-156"/>). It is only through deliberate
                                reversal of these twelve links that one can succeed in bringing the

                            <term type="definition">Nirvāṇa, the state beyond sorrow, denotes the
                                ultimate attainment of buddhahood, the permanent cessation of all
                                suffering and the afflicted mental states which cause and perpetuate
                                suffering, along with all misapprehension with regard to the nature
                                of emptiness. As such, it is the antithesis of cyclic existence.
                                Three types of nirvāṇa are identified: (1) the residual nirvāṇa
                                where the person is still dependent on conditioned psycho-physical
                                aggregates, (2) the non-residual nirvāṇa where the aggregates have
                                also been consumed within emptiness, and (3) the non-abiding nirvāṇa
                                transcending the extremes of phenomenal existence and quiescence.

                                Jamgon Kongtrul (TOK, Book 6, Pt. 2, p. 498), defines <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prajñā</foreign> as “the

                                sixteen-syllable lines (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">pāda</foreign>) each of which can be subdivided into two
                                half-lines of eight syllables. In the Tibetan translations a śloka
                                is usually rendered as a four-line verse. However, the term is also
                                used (especially in catalogues of canonical works) as a unit
                                measuring the length of texts written in prose or in a mixture of
                                prose and verse, in which case it simply measures thirty-two
                                syllables. The titles of the principal Prajñā­pāramitā sūtras, most
                                of which are written in prose, identify them by including mention of
                                their length in ślokas, usually translated in English as “in nnn
                                lines.” The original titles, even in their long form, include only
                                the number itself, and that this refers to the length in ślokas is
                                by convention inferred.</term>
