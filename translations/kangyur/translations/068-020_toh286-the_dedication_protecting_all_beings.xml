                        sbyong</foreign>). The text enumerates the many faults, shortcomings, and
                    afflictions that burden sentient beings, and also the many possible attainments
                    that they may have consequently not realized, with the wish that everything that
                    will ripen for sentient beings ripen instead for the reciter, so that all
                    sentient beings are thus liberated and purified.</p>

                    translator Zsuzsa Majer in collaboration with Karma Dorje (Rabjampa), a native
                    Tibetan speaker and Tibetan language expert; Beáta Kakas, the Sanskrit expert
                    for checking Sanskrit terms; and Nathaniel Rich, the English-language editor, in

                    <p tid="7"> This short text and <title xml:lang="en">The Dedication “Fulfilling
                        All Aspirations”</title> (<ref target="https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-068-019.html">Toh 285</ref>) appear to
                        constitute a pair, and this for several reasons. First, the two texts, both
                        of which lack Sanskrit titles, appear side by side both in the Denkarma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan dkar ma</foreign>) imperial catalogue
                        and in the extant Kangyurs of the Tshalpa and Thempangma lines. In the
                        Tshalpa Kangyurs, the two are placed at the very end of the Mahāyāna
                        division of the General Sūtra (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mdo sde</foreign>) section, and in the Thempangma Kangyurs toward the end of the entire
                        General Sūtra section. Their function as dedications therefore seems to be
                        reflected in that placement, and in the Tshalpa Kangyurs, at the very least,
                        the two appear to be dedications meant specifically to seal the Mahāyāna
                        sūtra sections. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-068-020-4"/>
                    <p tid="8"> Second, since the two texts are dedications, it is perhaps not
                        surprising that they are neither called sūtras nor are they works that
                        possess features typical of sūtras, such as the opening “Thus did I hear” or
                        an introductory passage describing the setting and audience of the
                        discourse. What is somewhat surprising is that, in spite of that, both are
                        included together in the sūtra section of the Kangyur. Along those lines,
                        the lack of features that typically distinguish sūtras led the
                        fifteenth-century scholar Pekar Sangpo (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">pad dkar
                            bzang po</foreign>), in his analytical survey of all the sūtras found
                        in the Kangyur, to conclude that the two texts are extracts from another
                        sūtra, though he does not say which.<note place="end" index="1" xml:id="UT22084-068-020-5"> Pekar Sangpo (2006), pp. 383–390. In this
                            regard, it is worth noting that Pekar Sangpo gives both texts titles
                            that include the word “sūtra.”</note> No such text, sūtra or otherwise,
                        has yet been identified. What can be said with a reasonable degree of
                        confidence is that, regardless of their exact provenance, the two texts were
                        translated from Sanskrit or another Indic language in the late eighth or
                        early ninth century. The short colophon to the present text attests to that,
                        providing the names of the two translators, the Indian abbot Vidyākaraprabha
                        and the Tibetan translator Bandé Yeshé Nyingpo, and the senior
                        editor-translator Bandé Paltsek, who edited and finalized the text. The text
                        is also listed in both the Denkarma and Phangthangma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’phang thang ma</foreign>) catalogues. This confirms
                        the dating of the Tibetan translation to the early ninth century at the
                        latest.<note place="end" index="2" xml:id="UT22084-068-020-6"> The present
                            text is found in the Denkarma catalogue in the Various Prayers (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">smon lam sna tshogs</foreign>) section under the

                    <p tid="10">The structure of the present text partly reflects the liturgy of
                        “seven branches” or “seven limbs” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">yan lag bdun pa</foreign>), a set of practices that came to serve as
                        the basic structure of many Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna Buddhist prayers,
                        sādhanas, and pūjās. The seven branches are commonly as follows: prostration or
                        homage, offering, rejoicing in virtue, requesting the buddhas to teach,
                        requesting the buddhas to not pass into nirvāṇa, and dedication of merit.
                        Not all of these seven are present in this text, which suggests that perhaps
                        the set was formalized only later. The structure of the present text also
                        partly reflects the structure of the preceding text. For example, here there
                        is also only a single line of homage at the very beginning, which might
                        indicate that the line was intended only as a customary homage. Also in
                        common with the preceding text, the line of homage is followed by a request
                        that the buddhas and bodhisattvas pay heed to the reciter. And what
                        immediately follows are four brief lines, each of them devoted to a single
                        act in the order in which they appear in the preceding text: confession,
                        rejoicing, supplicating the buddhas, and dedicating all merits. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-068-020-10"/>
                    <p tid="11"> What sets this short text apart, however, is the extensive
                        dedication that follows, comprising the bulk of the prayer. This features an
                        enumeration of the many faults, shortcomings, and afflictions that burden
                        sentient beings and also the many possible attainments that they may have
                        consequently not realized, with the reciter expressing the wish that
                        everything that will ripen for sentient beings instead “ripen for me”
                            (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">bdag la smin</foreign>), so
                        that all sentient beings are thus liberated and purified. This strongly
                        resonates with the much later Tibetan mind training (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">blo sbyong</foreign>) teachings,
                        especially their central contem­plative exercise of “giving and taking” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">gtong len</foreign>).
                        Considering how pervasive the mind training teachings became, and still
                        remain, in the Tibetan Buddhist world, it might come as a surprise to learn
                        that other sūtra sources in the Kangyur for the development of that specific
                        aspiration—that the suffering and negative karma of sentient beings “ripen
                        for me”—are practically nonexistent. In fact, it would appear that this
                        hitherto-unnoticed dedication contains the only explicit articulation to be
                        found in the Kangyur of the paradigmatic aspiration of mind training—the
                        wish that the suffering of others instead “ripen for me.” </p>

                        whatever falsehoods they have spoken and harmful thoughts they have had;

                        practicing in accordance with the Dharma; that they have not correctly known

                        obscured, veiled, and fettered by obscurations: the taming of sentient
                        beings, the taming of self, the taming of others, the taming of both, taming
                        gently, <ref cRef="F.80.b" type="folio"/> taming wrathfully, taming with equanimity, taming

                        the practice of the perfections of generosity, ethical discipline,
