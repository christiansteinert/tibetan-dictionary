                <p tid="1">Written around the tenth or the eleventh century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, in the late Mantra­yāna period, <title xml:lang="en">The Tantra of
                        Caṇḍa­mahāroṣaṇa</title> represents the flowering of the Yoginī­tantra
                    genre. The tantra offers instructions on how to attain the wisdom state of
                    Buddha Caṇḍa­mahāroṣaṇa through the practice of the four joys. The tantra covers
                    a range of practices and philosophical perspectives of late tantric Buddhism,
                    including the development stage, the completion stage, the use of mantras, and a
                    number of magical rites and rituals. The text is quite unique with its tribute
                    to and apotheosis of women and, in this regard, probably has few parallels
                    anywhere else in world literature. It is written in the spirit of great
                    sincerity and devotion, and it is this very spirit that mitigates, and at the
                    same time empowers, the text’s stark imagery and sometimes shocking practices.
                    This text certainly calls for an open mind. </p>

                    the supervision of Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche. Wiesiek Mical translated the text from
                    the Sanskrit manuscripts, prepared the Sanskrit edition, and wrote the
                    introduction. The translation was then compared against the Tibetan translation
                    found in the Degé Kangyur by James Gentry, and edited by Andreas Doctor. </p>
                <p tid="3">The Dharmachakra Translation Committee is also indebted to Professor
                    Harunaga Isaacson and Dr. Péter Szántó for their help in obtaining facsimiles of
                    some of the manuscripts, and to Professor Isaacson for making available some of
                    his personal materials. </p>

                    <p tid="5">Like most Buddhist tantras, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa­tantra</title> (CMT) is regarded within the Vajrayāna
                        tradition as a divinely revealed text, with its teachings delivered directly
                        from the level of the saṃbhogakāya, that is, the bliss body of Lord Buddha.
                        In such tantras, the saṃbhogakāya deity who delivers the original discourse
                        varies—it could be Avalokiteśvara, Vajrapāṇi, or others. In this case, it is
                        Lord Vajrasattva. The teaching itself takes the form of a dialogue between
                        Vajrasattva and his consort. Lord Vajrasattva here assumes the identity of
                        the deity Acala (Immovable One), which is another name for the deity of the
                        title, Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa (Fierce Great Angry One). His consort is
                        Vajra­dhātvīśvarī (<term>Goddess of the Vajra Realm</term>). </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-080-015-4"/>
                    <p tid="6">As is the case with all tantras, the person who put the CMT into
                        writing chose to remain anonymous in conformity with the tradition, which no
                        doubt saw the author merely as a medium for conveying this secret teaching.
                        However, in the search for the earthly origin of this text, the
                        circumstantial evidence seems to point to a Nepalese origin, most likely
                        Newar. Of the more than one hundred extant manuscripts of the CMT, ranging
                        in date from 1380 up to the twentieth century, all were written in Nepal, as
                        were the only two known manuscripts of the CMT commentary, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Padmāvatī</title>. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-080-015-5"/>
                    <p tid="7">Although the tradition of this tantra and its title deity never
                        became widespread or popular outside the Kathmandu Valley, it flowered and
                        thrived for almost a millennium among Kathmandu’s Newar Buddhist community,
                        leaving a rich legacy still evident today. There is at least one active
                        shrine of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa in the Kathmandu Valley; it is part of the
                        sacred Hiraṇyavarṇa Mahāvihāra complex in Patan. Most shops that sell
                        Buddhist art in Kathmandu offer a selection of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa paintings,
                        and the CMT is still being taught by Newari Bajracharyas—themselves part of
                        its unbroken spiritual heritage—such as Yagnyaman Pati Bajracharya, who
                        traces his family line back to the eighth-century Buddhist master
                        Vilāsavajra. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-080-015-6"/>
                    <p tid="8">The CMT appears to have drawn on a number of earlier scriptures,
                        including the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhya­samāja­tantra</title> (Toh
                        442), the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">He­vajra­tantra</title> (Toh 417), the
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Siddhaika­vīra­tantra</title> (Toh 544),<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-080-015-2142" index="1">Cf. Dharmachakra
                            (2016).</note> and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Citta­viśuddhi­prakaraṇa</title> of Āryadeva (Toh 1804). In turn, it
                        influenced other works, such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vidyā­dhara­vinoda­tantra</title>.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-080-015-2143" index="2">Cf. Isaacson (2006).</note>
                        However, among all the works devoted to the deity Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, the CMT
                        is unquestionably the most important. Other works centered on this deity
                        include sādhana, dhāraṇī, and stotra compositions—all of them, as their
                        genres might suggest, much shorter than the CMT. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-080-015-7"/>
                    <p tid="9">One should note, however, that the CMT was not the first scripture to
                        introduce its main deity. There is at least one earlier occurrence of the
                        name Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, found in the first chapter of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Siddhaika­vīra­tantra</title> as part of the mantra
                            <foreign type="mantra" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa hūṁ
                            phaṭ</foreign>.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-080-015-2144" index="3">The seventeenth mantra; see Dharmachakra (2016).</note> Moreover, the
                        deity himself seems to predate the name Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa. Under his other
                        name, Acala, he has a tantra devoted to himself, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Acalakalpa</title>. This is one of the core
                        Kriyātantras of the Tathāgatakula group, predating the CMT by a few or even
                        several hundred years. The name Acala is also found in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vairocanābhi­sambodhi</title>

                        Although the cult of this deity under the name Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa was more or
                        less confined to the Kathmandu valley, it spread farther afield under the
                        name Acala, reaching as far as Japan, where the practice of Acala (“Fudō” in
                        Japanese) became important in Shingon Buddhism.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-080-015-2147" index="6">Cf. Isaacson (2010).</note>

                        Sanskrit text of the complete tantra that appears as the appendix to this
                        translation is a half-critical, half-diplomatic edition chiefly based on the

                        in the endnotes. However, as there are literally hundreds of minor

                        on the CMT, which was written by one Mahāsukhavajra. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Padmāvatī</title> is preserved in two Nepali

                        9–12 of the CMT, which was edited by Harunaga Isaacson to accompany his

                    <p tid="14">The text of the CMT presumes the reader’s prior knowledge and
                        understanding of Buddhism’s main principles, including the tenets of
                        Vajrayāna. Further, it requires that the reader has faith and devotion,
                        which is so indispensable for the intuitive grasp of, and the eventual
                        awakening to, the true nature of things—the nature that is described as
                        empty (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">śūnya</foreign>). According to
                        the CMT, this awakening is irreversible and is therefore termed
                            <distinct>indestructible awakening</distinct> (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vajrabodhi</foreign>). It can only take place when all
                        dualistic concepts, such as “pure” and “impure,” fall away. And it is here
                        that the seemingly revolting practices found in our text become significant:
                        they are a call to give up our deluded dualistic notions, while at the same
                        time constituting a touchstone for the direct experience of reality, a
                        reality where even what may seem revolting to the conceptual mind can now be
                        experienced as the deity. The inclusion of such “extreme” practices is a
                        testimony to the fact that the CMT presents us not with mere sophistries,
                        but with practices rooted in actual experience. </p>

                        on the “inverted” practices to someone who has not first been initiated into
                        the maṇḍala of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa. The initiation itself would not be
                        effective unless the pupil has realized the empty nature of mind, and the
                        practices must not be undertaken by someone who has not achieved sufficient
                        control over his <term type="ignore">prāṇa</term>-mind (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vāyucitta</foreign>). However, as there are currently

                        would be difficult, if not impossible, to become initiated into these
                        practices. As for simply reading the CMT, one should proceed at one’s own
                        risk—with the prerequisite, at the least, of an open and respectful frame of
                        mind. </p>

                        especially those of the Yoginī class, bring in another essential element.
                        This is the overwhelming intensity of experience that obliterates mental
                        acts of self-reference. When this experience is founded on an exclusively
                        benevolent frame of mind, such as the feeling of great affection (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">mahārāga</foreign>), there is a chance
                        that dualistic fixations can melt away, bringing on an irreversible change.
                        This brings us closer to the specific content of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Caṇḍa­mahāroṣaṇa­tantra</title>, namely its sexual
                        practices. When used skillfully, sexuality becomes a powerful tool. The
                        ritual union engages the two partners on all levels—the physical level; the
                        level of the five senses (the senses constituting a bridge between the body
                        and consciousness); and all the different levels of consciousness. The
                        partners, perceiving each other as deities, generate strong love and
                        devotion for one another. Their union allows for an intense experience,
                        which brings the mind effortlessly into focus and sharpens the awareness.
                        After the intensity peaks, there is a brief natural gap, when the three
                            <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kleśas</foreign>—desire,
                        aversion, and indifference, which normally drive one’s conceptual
                        thinking—completely cease. All that is needed at this point is recognition.
                        This recognition can be arrived at and stabilized through the repeated
                        practice of ritual union. </p>

                    <p tid="19">The theory and practice of this union as presented in the CMT
                        revolves around the four joys (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">caturānandāḥ</foreign>). One observes these four as they arise during
                        the ritualized lovemaking, and one learns to discern the “gap”—an ineffable
                        state of nondual awareness at the point at which supreme joy (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">paramānanda</foreign>) gives way to innate
                        joy (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">sahajānanda</foreign>). This gap
                        can be discerned during the innate joy phase, which, as the commentary tells
                        us, corresponds in the male to the period between the moment when semen
                        reaches the tip of the penis, to the moment when all of the semen has
                        entered the vagina. Once this gap—an interruption in the continuum of the
                        subject, the object, and grasping—is recognized, one gradually learns to
                        prolong this state of mind until one attains stability. The four joys are,
                        in fact, the foundation stone for the practice of the deity
                        Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, and also the central theme of the soteriological part
                        (roughly the first sixteen chapters) of the CMT. </p>

                    <p tid="20">Readers not familiar with the social customs of the period might
                        feel surprised at the young age of girls—sometimes as low as twelve—accepted
                        as consorts in the practice of sexual yoga. Sexual initiation early in life
                        was the norm of the day and certainly not unique to the tantras. In India,
                        the ancient norm-setting law books (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">smṛtiśāstras</foreign>), which remained authoritative throughout the
                        entire Indian phase of Vajrayāna Buddhism, were concerned not so much with
                        the youngest age at which sexual activity was permissible, but rather with
                        the oldest <emph>before</emph> which the girl must become sexually active in
                        order not to miss her first opportunity to conceive. One law book warns of
                        consequences if this opportunity is missed: “When she reaches twelve…, the
                        forefathers (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">pitṛ</foreign>) of the
                        girl who has not yet been given in marriage will themselves drink her
                        menstrual discharge every month” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Parāśarasmṛti</foreign>, 7:5–6). Another book concurs: “A girl who sees
                        her own menstrual blood in her father’s house shall be known as an outcaste”
                            (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Viṣṇusmṛti</foreign>, 24:41).
                        The purpose of the sexual act as espoused in different literary genres may
                        have varied (from the reproductive in the <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">smṛtiśāstras</foreign> to the soteriological in the
                        Yoga- and Yoginītantras), but the early sexual initiation is evidenced
                        throughout the whole spectrum of Indian literature. That said, one must add
                        that the age most often recommended by the tantras was actually not twelve
                        but sixteen; this is paralleled by the age of the deity forms visualized
                        during the sādhana. </p>

                        present throughout the text, starts from the premise that the man and the
                        woman are deities—Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa and Vajra­dhātvīśvarī, respectively—and
                        both should worship each other as such. The text, however, dwells on the
                        service rendered by a man to a woman, rather than the other way around. The
                        woman is the one who grants the ultimate beatitude and the final awakening,
                        and she is the one who deserves infinite gratitude and devout service. This

                        presented a particular difficulty during the translation work. There are
                        discrepancies between the traditional sources as regards plant names, and
                        sometimes several plant species contend for the same name. Modern scholars
                        of āyurveda or ethnobotany do not always agree among themselves concerning
                        the correct identification of some plants. A certain amount of care was
                        taken, however, to identify every plant by the names found in the Sanskrit
                        and the Tibetan texts. A number of reference works and specialized websites
                        were consulted, but, needless to say, not all the plants and substances have
                        been identified reliably, and some could not be identified at all. Some
                        passages in the sections containing such recipes still remain unclear. </p>

                    <p tid="28">The mantras and dhāraṇīs have been translated, for the most part, as
                        they often take the form of a request or a prayer, and their semantic
                        content is usually related to the ritual in which they are employed. This
                        particularly applies to the longer formulae, such as garland mantras or
                        dhāraṇīs. However, because they are meant to be recited in their original
                        Sanskrit form, which is believed to possess liturgical and magical
                        significance, their full Sanskrit text has been given in notes. Translation
                        of these formulae, again, presented a problem, and the reader should note
                        that many words that are not standard Sanskrit have not been identified with
                        certainty, and some have not been identified at all. </p>

                    <p tid="29">Technical Sanskrit terms that do not have English equivalents have
                        either been translated descriptively, or the original term was used with a
                        link to the glossary. As the ritual jargon of the tantras is often
                        incompatible with modern English in terms of semantics and usage, the reader
                        will find that certain English words in our translation have been used in a
                        somewhat unconventional way. For example, in our translation the direct
                        object of the verb <emph>to incant</emph> can be not only the mantra but
                        also, just as in Old English, the object over which the spell or the mantra
                        is to be recited. Although there is a significant precedent for this
                        particular usage in modern English, in genres ranging from academic works to
                        the Harry Potter novels, this could still seem “incorrect” to many readers. </p>

                    <p tid="30">As already mentioned, the CMT includes instructions that are not
                        intended as spiritual per se. Among the methods of the do-it-yourself type,
                        the tantra distinguishes a special category that it refers to as <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kutūhala</foreign>, that is, “curious” or
                        “odd.” As this name suggests, these methods—such as setting a cow bone
                        ablaze, making things glow at night, or causing iron to appear as
                        copper—might have been included in the tantra because of their curiosity
                        rather than their practical value. Obtaining the necessary requisites for
                        some of these practices might require <term type="ignore">killing</term>
                        animals or performing other acts conventionally regarded as unwholesome. A
                        few of these practices might appear, by society’s norms, as frivolous, if
                        not gratuitously harmful. These “odd” elements are, however, neither unique
                        to the CMT (many tantras include a chapter or section devoted to them), nor
                        do they purport to be part of this tantra’s main message. The aim and
                        purpose of the CMT’s profound teachings lies in the realization of nondual
                        awareness through the practice of the four joys. As such its unique beauty
                        is in the love and devotion experienced in the union of the two partners—the
                        wisdom and the <term>means</term>. </p>

                        days. If one cannot see the tip of one’s nose, one will die within five
                        months. If one doesn’t see flashes of light when pressing one’s eyes with
                        one’s fingers, one will die within one hundred days. If one cannot hear
                        sounds in one’s ears, one will die within one year. If one cannot see one’s
                        own reflection in another person’s eyes, one will die within a fortnight.

                        the sources used for the first eight chapters was the Sanskrit text included
                        in George (1974), and for chapter 16, the Sanskrit text in Poussin (1897).
                        Most of the readings adopted here that depart from these two editions have
                        been reported, but on the whole, variant readings have been reported only
                        selectively. The edition follows mainly Manuscript A, our most reliable
                        source.</p>
                    <p tid="954">The abbreviation “Mss” can denote any combination of the above
                        listed manuscripts. Unreported emendments include the standardization of
                        Sanskrit sibilants or sandhi emendments. Sometimes the sandhi has not been
                        applied, for example, in mantras where it would not be pronounced, or metri
                        causa. Some of such instances have been marked with “ · ” (the “middle
                        dot”). We apologize for any editorial errors and other shortcomings.</p>
