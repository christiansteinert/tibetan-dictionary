                    narrative genre widely represented in the Sanskrit Buddhist literature and
                    its derivatives—comprising more than 120 individual texts. It includes
                    narratives of Buddha Śākyamuni’s notable deeds and foundational teachings, the
                    stories of other well-known Buddhist figures, and a variety of other
                    tales featuring people from all walks of ancient Indian life and beings from all six
                    realms of existence. The texts sometimes include stretches of verse. In the
                    majority of the stories the Buddha’s purpose in recounting the past lives of one or more
                    individuals is to make definitive statements about the karmic ripening of actions across
                    multiple lifetimes, and the sūtra is perhaps the best known of the many works in the 
                    Kangyur on this theme.</p>

                        derivatives. The term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadāna</foreign> can be analyzed 
                        and understood in several ways.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-073-001-7" index="2">See Sarkar (1981) pp.
                            46–49.</note> One common interpretation is “legend,” but that
                        understanding is perhaps too rigid, as well as too romantic, for what could be described
                        as religious or spiritual biography.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-073-001-8" index="3"> Perhaps a 
                            better definition is that of Sastri (1960) p. 72: “The word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadāna</foreign> 
                            signifies a ‘great religious or moral achievement
                            as well as the history of a great achievement.’ ”
                        </note> The general intention of avadāna literature is to elicit faith and
                        devotion in the reader through an object lesson in karmic cause and effect:
                        how, for example, a noble act motivated by faith and devotion toward the
                        Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha), or toward another object of
                        veneration, yields a good result, while the result of an ignoble act is dreadful.
                        Historically, the specific functions of avadāna literature were to propagate
                        Buddhism and to provide inspiration and preliminary education in the Dharma,
                        particularly for laypersons and the recently ordained.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-073-001-9" index="4"> See Rotman (2008) pp. 19–20.

                        most likely the product of the Sarvāstivādin school of Mahāyāna

                        to have originated in the northwest of India in the vicinity of Kashmir.

                        the Sanskrit text, but does not offer any indication of which school he
                        believes may have been responsible.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-073-001-12" index="6"> “Le Karma-Çataka me parait-être

Even before that, according to the fourteenth century chronicle <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">rgyal rabs gsal ba’i me long</title>, Drenka Mūlakośa and Jñānakumāra were sent by King Tridé Tsuktsen to invite “the two paṇḍitas Buddhaguhya and Buddhaśānta” to Tibet; the two paṇḍitas declined the invitation but the two translators learned by heart five Mahāyāna sūtras, including the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Karmaśataka</title>, and brought them back with them (see Sørensen 1994, p. 352).

                            for ordinary people a habit, and the tendency toward self-inflicted

                            Dharma, and are in fact harmful. For those who keep their distance from
                            these two extremes, there is a middle way that fully enlightens, passes
                            beyond all sorrow, gives rise to the eye of wisdom, and brings true
                            peace. What is this middle way? It is the eightfold path: right view,

                                and wood. One day, he ventured into the forest to cut down a tree
                                and a lion began to stalk him. In fear he scrambled up the tree, and
                                he found a bear sitting there who had already climbed up because he
                                too was afraid of the lion. When the man saw him he was doubly

                                this one might cause me harm.’ That bear, however, was a bodhisattva
                                of this fortunate eon. </p>

                            wondered, “Do these monks have some small measure of the virtues that
                            are conducive to the four stages of penetrative insight?” They looked
                            out and saw that they did, but that it depended solely on the two of
                            them. So Venerable Maudgalyāyana inspired the monks with a miracle of
                            magical abilities and Venerable Śāriputra inspired them with a miracle
                            of admonition. Casting away all afflictive emotions through diligence,
                            practice, and effort, they manifested arhatship. </p>

                        <p tid="1854">“What do you need him for?” they asked.</p>

                            his head to their feet and sat before Venerable Śāriputra to listen to
                            the Dharma. Venerable Śāriputra directly apprehended his thoughts,
                            habitual tendencies, temperament, capacity, and nature, and taught him
                            the Dharma accordingly. When he heard it, the young man destroyed with

                            concerning the transitory collection, and manifested the resultant state

                            manifested arhatship. Having achieved arhatship, he established his

                            King Udaya reigned in Suvīra. The two were dear friends, and from time

                            the king of Suvīra sent gifts of many mangoes to please King Pradyota.
                            King Pradyota gave some to the queen, some to his sons, and some to his
                            ministers. Then King Caṇḍapradyota himself ate some of the mangoes, <ref cRef="F.213.b" type="folio"/> and the thought came to him, “Here in
                            my country there are no mangoes, so I’ll plant these mango pits in the
                            garden.” He took those mango pits and planted them in his own garden,
                            and before long the trees grew big, and there was a large grove with
                            mature branches. Later, the trees blossomed and bore fruit, and King
                            Pradyota charged some untouchables with protecting the mangoes so they
                            would not be eaten by others. </p>

                            remnants of the mangoes, the royal servants informed King Pradyota.

                            householder, prosperous and wealthy, a person of vast and magnificent
                            means, endowed with the wealth of Vaiśravaṇa—with wealth to rival
                            Vaiśravaṇa’s. When the time came for him to marry he took a wife, and
                            they enjoyed themselves and coupled. As they enjoyed themselves and
                            coupled, one day his wife conceived, whereupon her whole body began to
                            smell of excrement. Then she had the impulse to eat excrement and drink
                                urine,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-073-001-2754" index="149">
                                “Had the impulse to eat excrement and drink urine.” This could also
                                be translated as a direct quotation of her thoughts: “had a

                            him, “Your wife has not been possessed by a rotting spirit. All this has
                            taken place on account of the being in her womb. When the child is born,
                            the smell of excrement will disappear from her body and such impulses
                            will disappear from her mind.”</p>

                        <p tid="2684">As soon as he heard this, the man began applying all manner of
                            ointments to his wife’s body. He was also worried that she would eat
                            excrement and drink urine, so he appointed attendants and guards for his
                            wife. After nine or ten months had passed, she gave birth to a child
                            caked in excrement and urine. Upon his birth the house was suffused by
                            the smell of excrement. The women washed the child and laid him out on
                            the bed, but still the smell of excrement did not clear from his body,
                            so his mother began applying all manner of ointments to him and left him
                            like that. After his birth the mother’s previous impulses disappeared. </p>

                            according to their clan. They reared him on milk, yogurt, butter, 
                            ghee, and milk solids, but once he was able to walk, he would pick up
                            excrement—some to eat, some to smear on his body—until the women put a
                            stop to this. As he grew up they made him study letters, but when they
                            sent him to a teacher, wherever there was some filthy excrement, he
                            would go and eat it. </p>

                            sure, we had a son,” they thought, “but if he has problems like
                            this—spoken ill of, all over the world—what use is he to us?” and they
                            threw him out of the house. And so he went to live in filthy excrement,
                            and <ref cRef="F.243.a" type="folio"/> constantly ate excrement and
                            drank urine. Many people saw him eating filth, and when they saw this,
                            they remarked to one another, “This young man is like a <term type="ignore">jackal</term>, eating excrement and drinking urine.”
                            So instead of his old name they started calling him Jackal, since he ate
                            excrement and drank urine like a jackal. </p>

                        <p tid="2688">“I don’t know that I’ve taken a vow, really,” the young man
                            replied. “I just crave excrement. I don’t care for ordinary food and

                            Then he went to where there was some excrement, and there he stayed.</p>

                            from rebirth as anguished spirits and took rebirth as gods. Take refuge
                            in the Blessed Buddha, and perhaps you too will be freed from

                            householder, prosperous and wealthy, a person of vast and magnificent
                            means, endowed with the wealth of Vaiśravaṇa—with wealth to rival
                            Vaiśravaṇa’s. The householder was of a loving nature, quite
                            compassionate, and equitable in charity. He cared for beings, wanted
                            deeply to perform acts of charity, and regarded persons of any and every
                            type of view equally.</p>

                            in textual studies of the treatises. When he looked out, he saw that he
                            was getting all of the praise while others were being disparaged, and
                            they were unhappy with him. </p>

                            and he thought, “Since the Blessed One has realized all dharmas, it’s
                            certain he’s omniscient.” And when he heard him being praised, he
                            thought, “How good it would be for the Blessed One to come to the site
                            of my sacrifice!”</p>

                            great many disciples.” With that thought he disappeared from the garden
                            of Prince Jeta and approached the householder’s site of sacrifice.</p>

                            the Blessed One, touched his head to the Blessed One’s feet, and
                            beseeched him, <ref cRef="F.45.a" type="folio"/> “Please come to the

                            Blessed One assented by his silence. Once the householder knew that the
                            Buddha and the rest of the saṅgha of monks were comfortably seated, by
                            his own hand he contented them with many good, wholesome foods,

                            for unexcelled, total, and complete enlightenment. He extended an

                            months, and provided everything they needed. On the last day he offered
                            the Buddha and the rest of the saṅgha of monks food of a hundred
                            flavors, and to the Blessed One he offered a very costly robe. </p>

                                transmitted in an essential form. Therefore it can mean “pithy
                                statements,” “rules,” and “aphorisms.” In Buddhism it refers to the
                                Buddha’s teachings, whatever their length, and in terms of the three
                                divisions of the Buddha’s teachings, it is the category of teachings
                                other than those on the vinaya and abhidharma. It is also used as a
                                category to contrast with the tantra teachings, though a number of
                                important tantras have sūtra in their title. Another very specific
                                meaning is when it is classed as one of the nine or twelve aspects
                                of the Dharma. In that context sūtra means “a teaching given in
                                prose,” and as such is one aspect of what is generally called a
                                sūtra (Roberts, Toh 113).</term>

                                of seeing. The seven limbs of enlightenment belonging to this path
                                are (23) the limb of right mindfulness, (24) the limb of right
                                analysis, (25) the limb of right effort, (26) the limb of right joy,
                                (27) the limb of right purification, (28) the limb of right
                                meditation, and (29) the limb of right equanimity. Here begins the
                                fourth path, the path of meditation, consisting of the noble
                                eightfold path: (30) right view, (31) right understanding, (32)
                                right speech, (33) right action, (34) right livelihood, (35) right
                                effort, (36) right mindfulness, and (37) right meditation. Upon
                                mastery of these thirty-seven comes the fifth path, the path of no
                                more learning (Gampopa 169, 260, 439; Jamspal 2012).</term>
