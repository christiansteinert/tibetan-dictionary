                    narrative genre widely represented in the Sanskrit Buddhist literature and
                    its derivatives—comprising more than 120 individual texts. It includes
                    narratives of Buddha Śākyamuni’s notable deeds and foundational teachings, the
                    stories of other well-known Buddhist figures, and a variety of other
                    tales featuring people from all walks of ancient Indian life and beings from all six
                    realms of existence. The texts sometimes include stretches of verse. In the
                    majority of the stories the Buddha’s purpose in recounting the past lives of one or more
                    individuals is to make definitive statements about the karmic ripening of actions across
                    multiple lifetimes, and the sūtra is perhaps the best known of the many works in the 
                    Kangyur on this theme.</p>

                            46–49.</note> One common interpretation is “legend,” but that
                        understanding is perhaps too rigid, as well as too romantic, for what could be described
                        as religious or spiritual biography.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-073-001-8" index="3"> Perhaps a 
                            better definition is that of Sastri (1960) p. 72: “The word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadāna</foreign> 
                            signifies a ‘great religious or moral achievement
                            as well as the history of a great achievement.’ ”
                        </note> The general intention of avadāna literature is to elicit faith and
                        devotion in the reader through an object lesson in karmic cause and effect:
                        how, for example, a noble act motivated by faith and devotion toward the
                        Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha), or toward another object of
                        veneration, yields a good result, while the result of an ignoble act is dreadful.
                        Historically, the specific functions of avadāna literature were to propagate
                        Buddhism and to provide inspiration and preliminary education in the Dharma,
                        particularly for laypersons and the recently ordained.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-073-001-9" index="4"> See Rotman (2008) pp. 19–20.

Even before that, according to the fourteenth century chronicle <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">rgyal rabs gsal ba’i me long</title>, Drenka Mūlakośa and Jñānakumāra were sent by King Tridé Tsuktsen to invite “the two paṇḍitas Buddhaguhya and Buddhaśānta” to Tibet; the two paṇḍitas declined the invitation but the two translators learned by heart five Mahāyāna sūtras, including the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Karmaśataka</title>, and brought them back with them (see Sørensen 1994, p. 352). If they were, in fact, responsible for an early Tibetan translation, it would almost certainly have been revised later, and the Tibetan that has survived in the Kangyur bears no particularly archaic characteristics. </note>

                            disillusionment with saṃsāra. When the Blessed One saw that they would

                            for ordinary people a habit, and the tendency toward self-inflicted
                            hardships, which are a form of suffering, do not belong to the noble
                            Dharma, and are in fact harmful. For those who keep their distance from
                            these two extremes, there is a middle way that fully enlightens, passes
                            beyond all sorrow, gives rise to the eye of wisdom, and brings true
                            peace. What is this middle way? It is the eightfold path: right view,
                            right understanding, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
                            effort, right mindfulness, and right meditation.” </p>

                                leftover decoction.” </p>

                                said. With these words he prepared a simple rice soup of his own,
                                but no sooner had he eaten it than stomach pain overtook him. He
                                rolled around on the ground, unable to bear the pain in his

                                Ānanda was concerned about his brother Devadatta and became worried.
                                He approached the Blessed One and informed him, “Lord, Devadatta is

                                As soon as the Blessed One heard this, he was seized by great

                                and wood. One day, he ventured into the forest to cut down a tree
                                and a lion began to stalk him. In fear he scrambled up the tree, and
                                he found a bear sitting there who had already climbed up because he
                                too was afraid of the lion. When the man saw him he was doubly

                                this one might cause me harm.’ That bear, however, was a bodhisattva
                                of this fortunate eon. </p>

                                creatures known as timi, whose bodies are 700 yojanas in length.
                                Whenever they get hungry they rise from this first stratum of water,
                                surfacing with mouths agape. Any smaller living beings present there
                                spill with the water into their mouths. When they have filled their

                                then eat the living beings that remain in their stomachs. The second
                                stratum of water is 25,000 yojanas deep, and in that stratum dwell
                                the sea creatures known as timiṅgila, whose bodies are 1,400 yojanas

                                25,000 yojanas deep, and in that stratum dwell the sea creatures
                                known as timiṅgilagila. Their bodies <ref cRef="F.143.a" type="folio"/> are enormous, measuring 2,100 yojanas. Whenever
                                they get hungry they rise up through the first, second, and third

                            travel through the townships for a little while. Lords, please confer
                            upon these monks instruction, advice to ponder, and a topic for further

                            wondered, “Do these monks have some small measure of the virtues that
                            are conducive to the four stages of penetrative insight?” They looked
                            out and saw that they did, but that it depended solely on the two of
                            them. So Venerable Maudgalyāyana inspired the monks with a miracle of
                            magical abilities and Venerable Śāriputra inspired them with a miracle
                            of admonition. Casting away all afflictive emotions through diligence,
                            practice, and effort, they manifested arhatship. </p>

                        <p tid="1854">“What do you need him for?” they asked.</p>

                            King Pradyota gave some to the queen, some to his sons, and some to his
                            ministers. Then King Caṇḍapradyota himself ate some of the mangoes, <ref cRef="F.213.b" type="folio"/> and the thought came to him, “Here in

                            mature branches. Later, the trees blossomed and bore fruit, and King

                            listening to the Dharma, they neither rose nor greeted him. At this King

                            anger. He looked about, saw Venerable Saraṇa there, surrounded by the
                            queens, and bristled with rage. In his anger he thought, “This monk is
                            ogling my wives, that’s why they’re not receiving me!” Then he thought,
                            “I will watch a while and see whether he is he rid of lust.”</p>

                            householder, prosperous and wealthy, a person of vast and magnificent
                            means, endowed with the wealth of Vaiśravaṇa—with wealth to rival
                            Vaiśravaṇa’s. The householder was of a loving nature, quite
                            compassionate, and equitable in charity. He cared for beings, wanted
                            deeply to perform acts of charity, and regarded persons of any and every
                            type of view equally.</p>

                            in textual studies of the treatises. When he looked out, he saw that he
                            was getting all of the praise while others were being disparaged, and
                            they were unhappy with him. </p>

                            certain he’s omniscient.” And when he heard him being praised, he
                            thought, “How good it would be for the Blessed One to come to the site
                            of my sacrifice!”</p>

                            beseeched him, <ref cRef="F.45.a" type="folio"/> “Please come to the

                            Buddha and the rest of the saṅgha of monks were comfortably seated, by

                            for unexcelled, total, and complete enlightenment. He extended an

                            months, and provided everything they needed. On the last day he offered
                            the Buddha and the rest of the saṅgha of monks food of a hundred
                            flavors, and to the Blessed One he offered a very costly robe. </p>

                            a god, but at that time their bodies begin to reek. (5) Deities’ eyes

                                but did not appear to them. The young brahmin, however, saw the
                                Blessed Buddha seated at the head of the row. Seeing him there, once

                                transmitted in an essential form. Therefore it can mean “pithy
                                statements,” “rules,” and “aphorisms.” In Buddhism it refers to the
                                Buddha’s teachings, whatever their length, and in terms of the three
                                divisions of the Buddha’s teachings, it is the category of teachings
                                other than those on the vinaya and abhidharma. It is also used as a
                                category to contrast with the tantra teachings, though a number of
                                important tantras have sūtra in their title. Another very specific
                                meaning is when it is classed as one of the nine or twelve aspects
                                of the Dharma. In that context sūtra means “a teaching given in
                                prose,” and as such is one aspect of what is generally called a
                                sūtra (Roberts, Toh 113).</term>

                                faculty of mindfulness, (16) the faculty of meditation, and (17) the
                                faculty of wisdom, and then the five strengths (on the five paths,

                                worldly dharma on the second path, the path of
                                application/application), which are (18) the strength of faith, (19)

                                strength of meditation, and (22) the strength of wisdom. Upon
                                completion of the five strengths, you enter the third path, the path
                                of seeing. The seven limbs of enlightenment belonging to this path
                                are (23) the limb of right mindfulness, (24) the limb of right
                                analysis, (25) the limb of right effort, (26) the limb of right joy,
                                (27) the limb of right purification, (28) the limb of right
                                meditation, and (29) the limb of right equanimity. Here begins the
                                fourth path, the path of meditation, consisting of the noble
                                eightfold path: (30) right view, (31) right understanding, (32)
                                right speech, (33) right action, (34) right livelihood, (35) right
                                effort, (36) right mindfulness, and (37) right meditation. Upon
                                mastery of these thirty-seven comes the fifth path, the path of no
                                more learning (Gampopa 169, 260, 439; Jamspal 2012).</term>
