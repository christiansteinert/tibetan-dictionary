This is a preliminary version, not a proper release.  

It will eventually get fleshed out, packaged properly as a module, and
submitted to CPAN.

Meanwhile, you need to create the directories "Lingua" and "Lingua/BO"
somewhere in your perl @LIB, and copy the files there: 

- Wylie.pm
- Phonetics.pm
- word_list.txt
- exceptions.txt

The files wylie.pl and phonetics.pl are CGI scripts that provide a user
interface to these modules; they can be copied to the cgi-bin of your
web server.

The files bin/wylie.pl and bin/pronounce.pl provide a command-line 
interface to the conversion between Wylie and Unicode, and to the phonetics
generation.
