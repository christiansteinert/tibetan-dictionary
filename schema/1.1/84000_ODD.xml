        <head>General Remarks</head>
        <p>Here is the complete documentation for 84000 TEI Documents. In the body there is a list
          of all the specifications for element, model classes, attribute classes, macros, and
          datatypes. The back matter contains first a set of guidelines for our own markup editors
          showing the process for the markup stage of our texts, which is then followed by some
          other appendices with further topeics and instructions for markup editors. All of these
          sections are accessible through links in the table of contents.</p>
        <p>NOTE FOR UPDATING THE SCHEMA: This ODD contains some content models that are written
          directly with RELAX NG in order to shape and restrict the form for published 84000 texts.
          If these need to be updated in the ODD, these content models, which outline the whole of
          the <gi>text</gi> are primarily to be found in the <gi>elementSpec</gi>s for the
            <gi>teiHeader</gi>, <gi>front</gi>, <gi>body</gi>, and <gi>back</gi> elementsSome RELAX
          NG content models are also defined in the a few <gi>macroSpec</gi> elements that are
          pointed to from within the content models of these four mentioned <gi>elementSpec</gi>s.
          All the the <gi>macroSpec</gi>s have been placed at the beginning of the ODD's XML after
          the <gi>moduleRef</gi>s and <gi>classSpec</gi>s, these are then followed by the
            <gi>elementSpec</gi>s. See <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.9">Appendix
            I</ref> for more details on proceedures for updating the schema.</p>

            <p>For 84000 texts, the <gi>bibl</gi> element is used for each bibliographic entry in
              the bibliography within the <gi>back</gi> section of the text. However, in each 84000
              text the <gi>bibl</gi> element is also used once in the <gi>sourceDesc</gi> to
              describe the bibliographic information for the 84000 text itelf; in this case the
                <gi>bibl</gi> is more elaborate and contains several child elements, see the second
              example below:</p>

          <remarks>
            <p>
              <gi>body</gi> (text body) contains the whole body of a single unitary text, excluding
              any front or back matter. So in an 84000 TEI encoded document, the body contains the
              whole translated text. It does not material written by the translator or editors, but
              just the original text in translation. It is part of the <gi>text</gi>, coming after
                <gi>front</gi> and before <gi>back</gi>. The body section opens approximately the
              same way in every document. The front closing tag precedes the body opening tag. That
              is followed by the div tag with the type attribute containing the "translation" value.
              This is followed by the head elements, with type values first of "translation" and
              then "titleMain", and then "titleHon" as shown below. After this comes the chapter or
              section div's, and so on. Even if there is no chapter division in the body of the
              translated text, there is minimally one section or chapter div, containing then the
              whole of the translation, and closing before the "colophon". Structurally the colophon
              section is equivalent to a chapter, and colophon is a value of a type attribute of a
              div element. The colophon div closes and then comes the closing div tag of the
              translation, and then the closing body tag. </p>

            <p>For 84000 texts, our parser italicizes text within this element. In the mark-up
              process, text that should be italicized but does not fall into the category of foreign
              text (tagged with the <gi>foreign</gi> element) should be marked up either with the
                <gi>distinct</gi> or <gi>emph</gi> element. <gi>distinct</gi> indicates that the
              italics identify any word or phrase that is not foreign, but is regarded as
              linguistically distinct, for example as archaic, technical, dialectal, non-preferred,
              etc., or as forming part of a sublanguage. <gi>emph</gi> indicates that the italicized
              words are not in a foreign language but are stressed or emphasized for linguistic or
              rhetorical effect.</p>

              <gi>div</gi> (text division) contains a subdivision of the front, body, or back of a
              text. All three subsections of the Front are designated by a div tag, which includes a
              type attribute that holds a value reflecting which subsection it is, for example:
                <tag>div type="acknowledgment"</tag>. Likewise the body has a div tag marking the
              translation, and within the translation, at least two div's, making the main part of
              the translation and the colophon. Any further subdivisions of the translation, into
              chapters or sections require additional div tags. All of the tags also contain the
              type attribute and translation, chapter, section or colophon values. This works the
              same way for the back section, with four div tags, at least. Each again has the type
              attribute and values of notes, listBibl (within listBible at least one div with type
              section) and glossary. </p>
            <p> Note that a prologue should have type="prologue" and not be labeled as "section". </p>

          <remarks>
            <p>Because of the particularities of electronic publishing, P5 Guidelines says that "the
              term edition may be used for a particular state of a machine-readable text at which
              substantive changes are made and fixed. The words revision and update, by contrast,
              are used for minor changes to a file which do not amount to a new edition. No simple
              rule can specify how ‘substantive’ changes have to be before they are regarded as
              producing a new edition, rather than a simple update. The general principle proposed
              here is that the production of a new edition entails a significant change in the
              intellectual content of the file, rather than its encoding or appearance. " For 84000
              texts, the element should include a version number or name and can include the
                <gi>date</gi> element. </p>

              second component of the fileDesc element and groups information relating to one
              edition of a text. It is an optional element, but recommended. It follows directly

              5 potential child elements that it can contain, but for 84000 texts, the only child

            <p>For 84000 texts, our parser italicizes text within this element. In the mark-up
              process, text that should be italicized but does not fall into the category of foreign
              text (tagged with the <gi>foreign</gi> element) should be marked up either with the
                <gi>distinct</gi> or <gi>emph</gi> element. <gi>distinct</gi> indicates that the
              italics identify any word or phrase that is not foreign, but is regarded as
              linguistically distinct, for example as archaic, technical, dialectal, non-preferred,
              etc., or as forming part of a sublanguage. <gi>emph</gi> indicates that the italicized
              words are not in a foreign language but are stressed or emphasized for linguistic or
              rhetorical effect.</p>
            <p>
              <gi>emph</gi> is also used for the word "Warning" in the tantric restriction within

              Romanized script then the first letter should be capitalized and "-Ltn" should be
              added to the value. For example Sanskrit "sa" becomes "Sa-Ltn", Tibetan "bo" becomes
              "Bo-Ltn", Chinese "zh" becomes "Zh-Ltn" and so forth. But use, the regular ISO 639-1
              code if the native script is used (usually this should only be the case with Tibetan
              "bo" or Chinese "zh"). Most instances of the <gi>foreign</gi> element should include
              the <att>type</att> attribute detailed above, although there are a few exceptions when
              foreign text will not fall into the "term", "quote", or "mantra" category and this
              attribute is not needed, for instance, the case of Tibetan Wylie transliteration given
              in parenthesis after the phonetic rendering of a Tibetan name. However, in general
              romanized foreign names should not be tagged with the <gi>foreign</gi> element. This
              tag should only be used for foreign text that are to be italicized according to
              84000's style guidelines, as our parser will italicize all instances of foreign text
              in the web display. There is one exception to this, in that text in the Tibetan and
              Chinese script should be tagged with the <gi>foreign</gi> element, but will not be
              italicized in the parser.</p>

            <p>The <gi>front</gi> (front matter) contains any prefatory matter. It is the first
              section of the <gi>text</gi> structure, so it comes after the <gi>teiHeader</gi>,
              which is outside of the <gi>text</gi> itself, and before the <gi>body</gi>, which is
              the second part of the <gi>text</gi> proper. The front matter of an encoded text
              should not be confused with the TEI header. The TEI Header, serves as a kind of front
              matter for the computer file itself, not the text it encodes. The <gi>front</gi>

            <p>In the glossary found in the back material of each 84000 text, the <gi>gloss</gi>
              element wraps each glossary term with its variations in Tibetan and Sanskrit along
              with a definition. The <gi>gloss</gi> element is requires the <att>xml:id</att>
              attribute, and the <att>type</att> attribute declaring whether it is a "term",
              "person", "place", or "text". The first <gi>term</gi> element (which has no attributes
              and presents the English translation of the term) will create a link to the glossary
              in the reading room for each instance of that term as it appears as a string in the
              text. However, in some cases it may be inappropriate to link certain strings of text
              that match this term and so optionally the <att>mode</att> attribute may be added with
              the values of "marked" or "match". A <gi>gloss</gi> element with the mode "match" will
              match with all instances of that string in the text unless they are marked with
              &lt;term type="ignore"&gt;. A term in the glossary with the mode "marked" will only
              link to terms with the <gi>term</gi> element. of the term, that are marked also by
                <gi>term</gi> tags the type attribute with the value of "alternate".</p>
          </remarks>
          <remarks>
            <p>There also may be occasions were the translator has used alternate translations for
              the same term, or different variations for the spelling of a string that correspond to
              the same glossary entry. In this case an additional <gi>term </gi> element should be
              added with the value "alternative". This will cause the parser to link these alternate
              string instances of the text in 84000's reading room.</p>

                  faraway buddha realm to teach in a way that demolishes all dualistic experience.
                  As Mañjuśrī begins to teach, the main message of the sūtra unfolds as an
                  explanation of the two truths. The general theme of Mañjuśrī’s discourse is
                  centered on the particular circumstances in Ratnaketu’s buddha realm, but the
                  message is equally applicable to the experiences of beings here in this world.

                  of Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche. Miguel Sawaya and Andreas Doctor produced the

                  grateful to Khenpo Trokpa Tulku, Lama Karma Oser, and Lama Tenzin Sangpo from
                  Ka-Nying Shedrub Ling Monastery for their assistance in resolving several

            <p> Unlike the div tags, the text between the opening and closing head tags are visible
              to the reader. So any major section of the front, body or back parts of the text that
              has a title, wraps that title in a head tag. Head tags need to follow directly after a
              div tag, or another head tag. Head tags have type attributes with values that often
              match the text between the tags. You can see this in the following snippet, from the
              front part of UT22084-060-008.</p>

            <p> Unlike section or chapter tags, label tags do not result in a real structural
              section of the text. A reader need to click a button to go to the next chapter. The
              label tag is a less obtrusive heading tag, labeling parts of texts, and not
              designating major sections. <gi>label</gi>s will appears in bold text in a slight
              larger type than the rest of the text, but the same color and same font. </p>

              <desc>These "type" values are used to identify the types of lists used in various
                places throughout the text: "glossary" is applied to the main list in the glossary,
                "abbreviation" is applied to the list of abbreviations within the notes section of
                the text. In addition to these two standard lists, the <gi>list</gi> element is also
                used for any outlines, bulleted lists, or other lists that appear with the actual
                text itself. In this case, the type attribute with the value "section" or "bullet"
                should be used, and this will effect how the list is displayed by the parser. The
                type value "section" will render a list of sections, with some vertical spacing
                between each item in the list; this is ideal for lists where each item is a
                paragraph or longer. The type value "bullet" will render the list with indentation
                but without vertical spacing; this is ideal for short items with identifiers (it
                isn't necessary that there be an actual "bullet" before each item, this is just the
                name we are using to distinguish the type). The latter two list types may also be
                used in combination to create an outline. For instance, see the sample of XML markup

                    wisdom which bodhisattvas are to perfect, Lord Buddha replies that it is the
                    absence of fixation with respect to all phenomena, all meditative experiences,
                    all causal attributes acquired by bodhisattvas, all fruitional attributes
                    manifested by buddhas, and all attainments up to and including omniscience.
                    along with unconditioned phenomena, such as the abiding nature of all things and
                    the finality of existence, these are all attributes with respect to which a
                    great bodhisattva being should cultivate detachment. Bodhisattvas do perceive
                    such phenomena distinctly, but only on the relative level; in an ultimate sense
                    they consider them to be illusory, in the manner of a dream and so forth. </p>

                    minds would view these phenomena and attributes as absolutely existent whereas
                    bodhisattvas should train so as to understand that they are all
                    non-apprehensible—mere designations and conceptualizations. </p>

            <p> In the texts, we use the milestone tag to develop as artificial demarcations of the
              text that will eventually allow people to refer to parts of a text in a somewhat
              standardized manner. Because there are no consistent natural break points in the
              original Tibetan texts, the 84000 team decided to use milestone tags. They represent
              small amounts of texts that are in someway semantically cohesive. They are not tied to
              a specific text length, but they are not more than a few paragraphs. <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.4">See the instructions for entering

                in Jeta Wood in Śrāvastī together with a great assembly of monks and a great
                multitude of bodhisatvas. The Buddha then addresses the bodhisatva Jayamati,
                instructs him on nineteen moral prescriptions, and indicates the corresponding
                effects of practicing these prescriptions when they are cultivated. </p>

            <p>This is by far the most common tag used in the markup. Pretty much any prose other

                <gi>p</gi> tag. Note that each <gi>p</gi> element should be numbered by the
                <att>tid</att> attribute; however, the markup editors do not need to enter these
              manually as they will be automatically applied when the file is saved to the

          <remarks>
            <p>Most of the <gi>p</gi> elements should be preceded by a <gi>milestone</gi> element.
              These will be automatically created by the XSLT script, but markup editors should go
              through and delete some of them according to the guidelines for entering in
              milestones.</p>

            <p>This element is used for in-text citations. The <att>target</att> attribute will
              point to the <att>xml:id</att> value of the appropriate <gi>milestone</gi>,
                <gi>note</gi>, or <gi>bibl</gi> (The value should be preceded by a "#" as in the
              example below). In the reading room this will create a link with the appropriate
              number. The milestone number itself will be automatically rendered in the reading room
              display, so this shouldn't be entered into the <gi>ptr</gi> element itself, but it may
              be displayed after as a comment for the editor's reference. Note, that links to other
              texts, i.e., external links, should be done with the <gi>ref</gi> element and not the
                <gi>ptr</gi> element. For more information on how to create links and references see

                  virtues of the bodhisattvas, showing how the Bodhisattva descended from the
                  sublime palace in the Heaven of Joy, intentionally entered the womb, and sojourned
                  in the womb. It shows the power of the place where he was born to a noble family,
                  and how he surpassed others through all the superior special qualities that he
                  demonstrated through his actions as a youth. It shows his many unique qualities,

                  fencing, archery, feats of physical strength, and wrestling, demonstrating his

                  the fourfold fearlessness, and the other innumerable qualities of a thus-gone one,

                  or else the parser will erroneously link to that folio in the eKangyur according to the <att>cRef</att>.
                  When the <att>work</att> attribute is present, the parser will create a link to that work
                  or leave the reference unlinked if the alternate work in not in the database.</p>

            <p>First, most commonly, the <gi>ref</gi> element is used to mark all folio references
              and bampo references in the text that correspond to the physical Dege pages. The
              actual reference number should be placed in the <att>cRef</att> attribute. This should
              always follow the format: F.[folio number].["a" for the recto (front) side or "b" for
              the verso (back) side], for example "F.82.b". Bampo references should be accompanied
              by the <att>type</att> attribute with the value "bampo" and follow the format "B[bampo
              number]", for example:</p>

            <p>Primarily the <gi>term</gi> element is used to list glossary terms in the back matter
              of a text. For each individual <gi>gloss</gi> element, which constitutes a single
              glossary entry, a list of several <gi>term</gi> elements are used (see the example
              below). The first <gi>term</gi> element, which should have no attritutes, shows the
              English translation of the term or the string used in for that term as it is found in
              the text. This first <gi>term</gi> element indicates to the parser which word or
              string of text to link to the glossary entry, and it will create a link for every
              instance of that term that is found in the text. The next <gi>term</gi> elements that
              follow within the <gi>gloss</gi> list the Wylie, Tibetan, and Sanskrit for that term,
              all indicated by the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute with the appropriate value. After
              that a definition is given in its own <gi>term</gi> element with the type="definition"
              attribute. Finally, if there are any alternate translations used for the term within
              the text that should be linked to this gloss, they are listed last each marked by
              type="alternative". These instances of alternative strings of text will also be linked
              to the glossary entry wherever they are found in the text. All of this can be seen in
              the first example below. For further notes about the glossary see <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.3">Appendix C</ref>.</p>

            <p>The <gi>term</gi> element may also be used in the text itself to alter the way a
              string of text is to be linked to the glossary. For example, a string of text can
              bypass being linked if it is placed within a <tag>term type="ignore"</tag> as like the
              following example. Alternatively, if the parent <gi>gloss</gi> element for an entry is
              given the attribute mode="marked" then it will only link to instances in the text that
              are contained within a <gi>term</gi> element. For more details on how the glossary

              it is the end of that chapter or text. This doesn't include colophons. This element
              functions like the paragraph, <gi>p</gi>, element and may require a milestone

            from the copy editors, it is important to check their work and make sure the text has
            been placed properly into the template.)</p>
          <list>
            <item>In general you can follow the instructions written in the template.</item>
            <item>Paste the text into all the appropriate sections using the "Heading 1, 2, or 3"
              styles to outline the text. Make sure that the style “Heading 4” or higher isn’t used
              anywhere in the document, as that information will be lost in the conversion process.
              Any headings for fourth level subsections (or higher) written by the translator should
              be set to the “Normal” style in the style set and be tagged with &lt;level 4 header&gt; or similar tags.
              These subsections will need to be manually created with <gi>div</gi> elements when you edit the XML. </item>
            <item>Apply all the various styles to the italics in the text.</item>
            <item>Apply the "verse" style to verses and format the verses (change the display
              settings to show paragraph marks and line breaks so you can see more clearly whether
              they are formatted correctly).</item>
            <item>In some cases the copy editors may have left comments for the markup editors with
              the MS Word comments feature. The script will convert these into <gi>note</gi>
              elements that will have the "place" attribute with the value of
              "comment_from_copyeditor_to_markup_editor." I have intentionally set this up to be
              highlighted by the schema as an error, so that the copy editors may highlight any
              unusual formatting or other issues that need to be addressed by the markup editors.
              You may leave these in and address them as you work on the XML or alternatively keep a
              backup of the .docx and reference the comments from there. If you don't want to see
              them in the XML, make a backup of the .docx and select "Delete All Comments in the
              Document" from the review pane in Word before sending the document through the
              conversion script.</item>

            <item>Use this <ref target="http://operations.84000-translate.org/index.html">conversion app on the project management page</ref>. First click on the "Search"
              tab and locate the file using the Tohoku number. Once you have found the text click on "edit
              headers", From there you can expand the "submissions" section and upload the .docx there.
              The app will perform the conversion and the output .xml file can be found in the 84000 Collaboration/apps/84000-import-data folder. 
            There will be a unique folder created with the name of the texts xml:id number.</item>
            <item>Occasionally the app may be down or the project management page may give you a permissions error. If it says that
              permission is denied you should email the lead technician who handles the server's
              permissions (Dominic). Alternatively, it is also possible to convert the
              word .docx created in the template through the <ref target="http://oxgarage.tei-c.org/">oXgarage website</ref> or <ref target="https://oxgarage2.tei-c.org/#">it's mirror site</ref>. Convert the file to a
              "TEI P5 XML Document" and run our own .xslt script on the document. The .xslt script
              is in apps/84000-import-data/xsl. (<ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.8">Instructions for running an .xslt script can be found in Appendix H</ref>)</item>

            </head>
            <item>This should create a file that is closer to what we want. However, the script is
              definitely not perfect, and many sections will need some reworking.</item>
            <item>If the "verse" styles were applied appropriately in the template, then the script
              should put them correctly into <gi>lg</gi> and <gi>l</gi> elements. It should also
              preserve and convert any italic markup within the verses. The script is able to do
              both because in MS Word the "verse" is a paragraph style and all the italic markups
              are character styles. However, for the script to work properly the individual lines of
              verse need to be separated by line breaks, and the stanzas themselves need to be
              separated by paragraph breaks. There are instructions for how to do this in the
              template, but this process can be a bit finicky, so you should double check some of
              the verses to make sure the conversion has worked properly. Refer to the section on
              the <gi>lg</gi> element to see how verses need to be formatted. </item>
            <item>Another note about the script to keep in mind is that the script is designed to
              automatically create divisions with <gi>div</gi> elements in the markup whenever the
              copy editors use the "heading 1," "heading 2," or "heading 3" styles in the template.
              This will create up to three levels of <gi>div</gi>s. As mentioned above any fourth
              level <gi>div</gi>s or further should be placed into tags by the copy editor and you
              will need to create the <gi>div</gi>s manually when you edit the XML. Occasionally,
              the copy editor will put a heading into the "heading 1" or "heading 2" style but they
              will mistakenly leave the paragraph break at the end of the heading's text in the
              "normal" style. The script generates the <gi>div</gi> elements according to these
              paragraph breaks, so in this case, it will not create the proper division. Usually it
              is easy enough to correct these in either the template .docx or in the .xml, but in
              some cases it may save you some time if you can identify and fix them before the
              conversion. For example, this happened in the bibliography of a text, and because the
              bibliography entries were nested with one <gi>div</gi> instead of two, the script
              rendered them into <gi>p</gi> elements instead of <gi>bibl</gi> elements as is
              required. </item>
            <item>The script has a section for making appendices, which should appear in the
                <gi>back</gi> after the bibliography. However, since not all the texts have
              appendices, and since appendices could appear in many different forms such as lists,
              outlines, Sanskrit sources, etc., the script only converts these into the minimal
              default paragraphs or verses. You may need to reformat the markup in the section
              extensively or paste it in from the word file and mark it up from there. If there are
              more appendices in the future, or a particularly large appendix that needs to be
              extensively edited, we will develop the script to convert the appendices in a more
              detailed way.</item>
            <item>If there is some unusual formatting or other issue that is preventing the script
              from converting the text properly, one strategy for isolating the problem is to divide
              the text into three pieces (front material, body, and back material), convert each
              section one be one, and then paste them into the final .xml. <ref target="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lVxX3YzQv1WC2fl0Sqb2G1jCdQte-q5t">For this
                purpose we have created a Dummy Template</ref> which is just the minimal format for
              an 84000 text. Try pasting the smaller sections of the text into the Dummy Template
              and convert them one by one.</item>

              <hi rend="bold">Merge the Converted XML into the Placeholder File:</hi>
            </head>
            <item> When you have finished converting the document into an TEI-XML file, it is time to
              transfer it into the translations folder. There should already be a placeholder file for each of the
              Kangyur and Tengyur texts. Go to 84000 Collaboration &gt; apps &gt; 84000-data &gt;
              tei &gt; translations, and you will see the "kangyur" and "tengyur" folders. Each of
              these folders in turn contain a "placeholders" folder and a "translations" folder.
              Find the placeholder file right click and select "cut" then move it into the sibling "translations"
              folder by right and select "paste" (don't use "copy" and "paste" as this will reset the files permissions). 
            </item>
            <item>
              You can then begin pasting the text from the XML you just converted into the placeholder
              text. The placeholder files mostly just contain the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, however, most of this is important
              information and should not be overwritten. 
              The converted XML will have directions in the form of comments, which will tell you specifically
              what elements within the teiHeader need to be added to the placeholder, and which to be left as is. 
              In general, try to preserve all pertinent information from both sources, and if there is any 
              data that seems to be contradictory, comment out the additional data and make a note of this in your 
              final list of notes and issues.</item>
            <item> The placeholder <gi>titleStmt</gi> should already contain some of the titles for
              the text, but the English titles should be updated according to the new translation (in this
              one case it is fine to overwrite the placeholder titles), add any of the titles that are not
              already in the placeholder. There should be a minimum of nine titles:
              4 Main Titles (Sanskrit, Tibetan, Wylie, English), 4 Long Titles (Sanskrit, Tibetan, Wylie, English), and
              1 Chinese. Any additional variant <gi>title</gi>s (whether coming from the converted file or already
              present in the placeholder) should be added after this as type="otherTitle". 
              The actual order of the titles doesn't matter because the parser
              will display them in the same order no matter what order the XML is in, but if one or
              more of the nine default titles are not present, leave an empty element there as a place holder,
              e.g., &lt;title type="otherTitle" xml:lang="zh"/&gt;.</item>
            <item>Also check the original word document for additional titles or authors, as
              the conversion script is quite rigid, and some of them might
              disappear if they were not entered properly.</item>
            <item>Alternatively, if you prefer, the titles can also be edited from <ref target="http://operations.84000-translate.org/index.html">the project management page</ref>
              using the original .docx as a reference. The project management page is linked directly to the teiHeaders in the XML.</item>

            should be selected from a drop down list, and (c) the "expression:" for how it appears as written in the
            acknowledgements. When you click on "save" it will automatically add these contributors to the teiHeader with

            <item>Click on the "status". From this window you will be able to see various features regarding the 
            text's status, some of which corresponds to data in the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, and some of this data
              is contained in separate data files. In the right column you will see a checklist for "Current Tasks".
            Here you can see the text's current stage within the work flow. You may "add to current tasks" as needed. </item>
            <item> To display the text on the Utilities page, you will need to change the "status"
              attribute within the <gi>publicationStmt</gi>. It should be at "2.b" during the
              copyediting phase, and now for the markup you should change it to "2.a." (Although it has probably already 
              been updated by the script). The text will
              now appear on <ref target="http://utilities.84000-translate.org/translations.html">the
                Utilities Page</ref>. Here you will be able to see how the text will be displayed on
              the webpage before it is published on the official 84000 page. Click on the link that

            <item>The schema should already be applied to the placeholder file, but if you need to 
              apply the schema directly it is located in “84000 Collaboration &gt; apps &gt; 84000-data &gt;
              schema &gt; current &gt; translation.rng.” You will see any schema errors as red bars
              on the right column in the oXygen window. Checking the schema is the best way to see
              if the XML is going to work correctly in the parser. If later on you have trouble
              saving to the database, or if you can save to the database but the web page does not
              display the text, then start by checking for schema errors in oXygen. If it says that
              there is an error where you don’t think there is really an error, but you need to
              check the XML on the web display, you can comment-out that section with comment
              tags:<lb/> &lt;!-- --&gt; (or highlight and press Ctrl-Shift “,” on PC or
              Command-Shift "m" on mac). Then you will be able to temporarily block all the seeming
              schema errors to help identify the problem. </item>
            <item>You will initially see many schema errors for some missing attributes such as "xml:id"s and "tid"s. 
              Note that all "xml:id" attributes, "tid" attributes in the <gi>p</gi> elements,
              and "index" attributes in the <gi>note</gi> elements will be added automatically when
              you save and reload the XML, so you don't need to worry about adding these. However,
              in the <gi>teiHeader</gi> within the <gi>publicationStmt</gi> there is an element for
              the id number for the text, <gi>idno</gi>. The script should just say "DUMMY" here so
              you will need to enter the number manually (you should be able to look up the text
              number as it is posted on the Trello board "UT22084-###-###"). Then the database will
              automatically generate the xml:id attributes throughout the text based on this.</item>
            <item>In case there is an error in any of the "xml:id" or "tid" attributes due to duplicates, then you can
              regenerate them by deleting any problematic ones, saving the file, and then
              re-opening. The "xml:id" and "tid" will be generated wherever they are missing. If
              not, email the lead technician and they will make sure they are regenerated. It is
              fine if the "xml:id" attributes are not in order as long as they each have a unique
              value.</item>

              <hi rend="bold">Some General Guidelines for Editing the XML:</hi>
            </head>
            <item>While editing the XML, I usually use a previously edited and published TEI
              document as a model to make sure everything is formatted in the same way. This can be
              helpful, especially if this is your first time marking up a text or if you haven't
              done the markup for some time.</item>
            <item>In general, while going through the text, it is important to periodically refer
              back to the .docx you received from the copy editor. If the document has an unusually
              formatted outline, some portions of text may be lost in the XSLT conversion. A good
              way to check this is to open the original .docx and look at the outline of the text
              (on PC go to “View” and check the box that says “Show Navigation Pane”; on Mac go to
              “View” &gt; “Sidebar” &gt; “Document Map Pane”; this might be different for other
              versions of Word). For example, if there are any fourth-level headers or extra
              divisions in the summary or acknowledgements, these sections may disappear. It is
              particularly good to check the front material and the bibliography for anything
              unusual.</item>
            <item>When you first get to the <gi>body</gi> of the text, you may notice that the title
            has been repeated with two lines containing separate <gi>p</gi> and <gi>milestone</gi>
              tags. For example: 
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <body>
                  <div type="translation">
                  <head type="translation"> The Translation </head>
                  <head type="titleHon">The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra</head>
                  <head type="titleMain">Distinguishing Between Phenomena and Reality</head>
                  <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                  <p>
                    The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra
                  </p>
                  <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                  <p>
                    Distinguishing Between Phenomena and Reality
                  </p>
                  
                  <!--...body of the text...-->
                  
                 </div>
                </body>
              </egXML>
              The reason for this, is the script has a safeguard to display any text within 
              the first main <gi>div</gi> but not included in the first second level <gi>div</gi>.
              A not ideal consequence of this safeguard results in this repetition of the first two lines,
              which simply needed to be deleted manually. So the above example should 
              be edited to look as follows:              
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <body>
                <div type="translation">
                <head type="translation"> The Translation </head>
                <head type="titleHon">The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra</head>
                <head type="titleMain">Distinguishing Between Phenomena and Reality</head>
              
                <!--...body of the text...-->
              
                </div>
              </body>
            </egXML>
            </item>
            <item>If either one of the introduction, main translation, and/or bibliography have only one section you will probably
              see this heading at the beginning of their second level <gi>div</gi> element: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <head>Main Section</head>
              </egXML> This is actually a placeholder from the template and should be removed, as
              the heading from the previous <gi>div</gi> element will provide the heading
              "Introduction" or "The Translation." </item>
            <item>If there were any italics that were missed in the copy editing phase, they will
              appear with a schema error in an element called "fix." You will need to manually fix
              these and replace them with the appropriate element, whether it be <gi>foreign</gi>,
                <gi>title</gi>, <gi>distinct</gi>, etc. Sometimes these may be just italicized punctuation
            that the copy editor or author made by mistake, in which case you can go ahead and remove these tags.</item>
            <item>Double check that the tag &lt;hi rend="small-caps"&gt; is used for any small capital
              letters in the text. This includes any abbreviations for CE ("Common Era") or
              BCE ("Before Common Era") in dates. 
              Note that the lowercase letter needs to be used for small-caps, for example:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                In the year 2000 <hi rend="small-caps">bce</hi>
              </egXML>
              Then the parser will render this as small capital "BCE".<lb/>
              Also, some of the Kangyur sigla in the abbreviations and notes use subscript letters. 
              For Kangyur sigla we use the Vienna system, which <ref target="https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/kanjur/rktsneu/sigla/">you can check the spelling here.</ref>
              Note that most of the sigla use a Capital letter followed by a lowercase one, but the sigla
              from the Peking Group, Mongolian, and Nyingma Kangyurs use a capital letter followed by subscript letters, 
              and these second letters should have the &lt;hi rend="subscript"&gt; tag. Here either the lowercase or uppercase 
              letter should be used according to the definitive sigla, for example:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                Peking 1737 PK = K<hi rend="subscript">Q</hi>, rnying rgyud bris ma = G<hi rend="subscript">bm</hi>.
              </egXML>
              Do not use any unicode for the small caps or subscript such as "ʙᴄᴇ" or "ᵥ" as this won't display consistently in the
              reading room for all browsers. The script should convert all small-caps and subscript from the template with the proper tag, 
              if "small-caps" and "subscript" were applied in the template using MS Words Font dialog (Format &gt; Font), but
              these should be double checked in the XML.
            </item>
            <item>Typically there will be many left over "<gi>hi</gi>" elements after the script has
              converted the text. With the one exception of rendering small capital and subscript letters (as shown in the example above)
              we don't really don't use any of these <gi>hi</gi> elements in our mark up. Most of these
              are just remnants of formatting from the word document, and the script should convert all of these to type="wordfile-remnant". 
              The refactoring tool is very helpful for removing them.
              In the oXygen menu go to "Tools" &gt; XML Refactoring, and then select "unwrap
              element." This operation removes the "<gi>hi</gi>" tags but leave the text within them
              untouched, however we only want to remove the &lt;hi type="wordfile-remnant"&gt; elements
              but not the &lt;hi rend="small-caps"&gt; and &lt;hi rend="subscript"&gt;elements. To do this, after selecting the "unwrap element"
              operation, it will ask us for the Target Elements (XPath). For this we should enter the XPath:
              <code>hi[@type="wordfile-remnant"]</code> This will only remove the <gi>hi</gi> elements with this attribute. 
              Now you can click on "Next" and then "Preview". Note that it will ask you to save all opened editors, 
              so be sure to close any editor windows that you don't want saved. 
              The Refactoring tool is very useful for removing or changing other unwanted
              markup as well. However, use some caution when making global changes like this. You
              will want to make sure you aren't removing any important data. Using the
              preview mode, you can see how a command is going to effect
              the text. In most cases, we will want to remove all the "&lt;hi type="wordfile-remnant"&gt;" tags, but before
              using the refactoring tool to remove them, be sure to take a quick glance through the
              text and make sure the <gi>hi</gi> tags are not being used for a significant markup
              that may have been missed or unrepresented in the copy editing phase. If you are
              unsure, or if the <gi>hi</gi> tags are too messy to tell, save a backup copy of the
              markup before removing them with the refactoring tool, then you can check them once
              more after you finish marking up the text.</item>
            <item>Look for any weird tags that shouldn't be there like "type="endnote text"" or any
              other relics from the oxgarage/script conversion.</item>
            <item>Look for any mistakes: typos, mislabeled tags, etc.</item>
            <item>As you do any major work on the text, it is a good idea to occasionally update the version
            number as a reference for file backups. For guidelines on how and when to do this, see
              <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.10">Appendix K: Guidelines for Updating Versions of the TEI Document</ref>.</item>

              <hi rend="bold">Editing the References in the XML:</hi>
            </head>
            <item>All the references such as [F.100.a], etc. need to be entered into <gi>ref</gi>
              elements with the "cRef" attribute, thus [F.100.a] should look like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <ref cRef="F.100.a"/>
              </egXML> Note that this is the standard we are using for all folio references: it
              should be an "F" followed by a period, a number, another period, and the letter "a" or
              "b." To put the bracketed folios into the <gi>ref</gi> element I usually use a search
              and replace with regular expressions. To do this open a find and replace box, check
              the "Regular Expressions" box and search for: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> \[(F\.\d+\.[ab])\] </egXML> Replace with:
                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <ref cRef="$1"/>
              </egXML> Or if they forgot to add the second period before that "a" or "b," like
              "[F.100a]", then search for: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                \[(F\.\d+)([ab])\] </egXML> And replace with: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <ref cRef="$1.$2"/>
              </egXML> Regular expressions are very useful for such tasks, just be careful not to
              search and replace any text or markup you did not intend to. For example, the
              introduction of a text might quote a folio reference number in the same format in
              which it was applied in the body of the text, say "[F.100.a]". We definitely don't
              want this instance placed into a <gi>ref</gi> element, so be careful not to
              inadvertently replace it with a "replace all" command. Usually when I do a search and
              replace, I replace a few individual items to make sure it is working properly and
              there aren't any anomalies before I do a "replace all" command. If you aren't familiar
              with regular expressions <ref target="https://regexr.com/"> this is a good reference
                website</ref>, and there are a lot of tutorials on youtube too. </item>
            <item>Sometimes there will be Bampo references and hidden references. To work with
              these see the section on <ref target="84000_ODD.html#TEI.ref">the <gi>ref</gi>
                element</ref>. </item>
            <item>When a <gi>ref</gi> comes between two paragraphs, it is better to place it at the
              end of the preceding paragraph rather than the beginning of proceeding one, as this
              will be less distracting for the reader. The very first <gi>ref</gi>, however, must be
              placed at the beginning of the paragraph as there is no other choice.</item>
            <item>Note, there are some texts that are duplicated in multiple sections of the Kangyur. For example 
              The Prophecy of Sri_Mahadevi is found twice in the Kangyur as Toh. 193 and 739. Theses
              are both word for word exactly the same, but the folio references are going to be different for each
              duplicate version of the text. So in this situation we just use one TEI file, "061-014_toh193,739"
              but the folio references are differentiated with the <att>key</att> attribute which will relate each
              individual <gi>ref</gi> to the corresponding <att>key</att> that is declared within that version's <gi>bibl</gi>
              element found in the TEI's initial <gi>sourceDesc</gi>. For example, in 061-014_toh193,739's <gi>sourceDesc</gi>:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <sourceDesc>
                  <bibl key="toh193" type="text">
                    <ref>Toh 193</ref>

                </sourceDesc>
              </egXML>
            Then if you look at each individual folio references they will be differentiated by the <att>key</att>
              like this:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              ...
              <p tid="9">
                <ref cRef="F.246.a" key="toh193"/>
                <ref cRef="F.230.a" key="toh739"/>
                Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.
              </p>
            </egXML>
            Now the parser will only display the appropriate folio references, e.g., when you click on Toh.
              193 it will show the references for Toh. 193 but not those for 739 and vice-versa. Sometimes the page breaks
              between the folios will be in the same place in the eKangyur but often they are different so you may need to 
            go in and find them all manually if they were not written in by the translator.</item>

            <item>The copy editors have been instructed to put any block quotes into <gi>q</gi>

              </egXML> Occasionally the copy editors might forget to put in tags for block quotes.
              Therefore, refer back to the original .docx if it seems like a section should be put
              into block quotes. Add a note to the final list of questions and issues if there is a
              section that was not set apart as a block quote that you believe should have. </item>
            <item>Check for any other tags that the copy editor may have entered in by doing a quick
              search for the character codes for angular brackets: &amp;lt; or &amp;gt; this might

            <item> Within the notes section of the text the template and script will create an
              abbreviations section even if there isn't one. If there isn't any abbreviations
              section in the original docx. you can delete the abbreviations header but leave the
              section for notes. It should just look like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

            <item>Any formal lists or outlines within the text should be marked up with the

              value "section" or "bullet." "Section" should be used for longer items of text, and it
              will render them with some vertical spacing between each item. "Bullet" should be used
              for shorter items and will create some horizontal indentation (it isn't necessary for
              there to be actual "bullets" in the list, this is just what we have named it). These
              types can be used in any combination to create an outline. For further details on

                Appendix B.3</ref>. </item>
            <item>Check that all the <gi>div</gi> elements are marked up with the proper
                <att>type</att> attributes. See the documentation for the <gi>div</gi> element to
              see the list of acceptable values. Note that a "prologue" or "colophon" should be
              marked as such and not as a "section." Also, each <gi>div</gi> should be accompanied
              by a <gi>head</gi> that has its own matching <att>type</att> attribute; however, there
              is one exception to this, &lt;div type="section"&gt; may be left without a
                <gi>head</gi> if the author did not provide one, this will usually be the case in
              the Introduction, Main Translation, or Bibliography whenever there is just one section and by default
              it is placed into a second level &lt;div type="section"&gt; wrapped within a first
              level &lt;div type="introduction"&gt; or &lt;div type="translation"&gt;. In this case
              the parser will read the <gi>head</gi>s from the main first level <gi>div</gi> and the
              second level &lt;div type="section"&gt; will not require an additional
              <gi>head</gi>.</item>
            <item>The script doesn't distinguish between chapters and sections, so the type value
              for all the "chapters" needs to be applied manually. Also, "chapter"s should contain a
                <gi>head</gi> type="chapter" element with some kind of enumeration, i.e., "chapter
              one," "chapter two," etc. If there is a formal title it should be contained in a
                <gi>head</gi> type="chapterHead" element following the first <gi>head</gi>. For
              example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <div type="chapter">
                  <head type="chapter">Chapter 32</head>

            </item>
            <item>Some texts have <gi>trailer</gi>s at the end of each chapter, for example in Toh.
              11: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                  entitled “Cultivation.”</trailer>
              </egXML> Be default the script will convert every paragraph into a <gi>p</gi> element,
              so these <gi>trailer</gi>s should be manually applied if they appear at the end of
              each chapter. </item>
            <item>All of the trailers will be italicized in their entirety by the parser, so
            any <gi>title</gi>s that appear in the trailer should be giving curled quotations marks. 
              You will probably need to add these as the italicization could likely have been unnoticed in the copy editing

            <item>As you are working with the TEI texts, you may encounter various problems that
              require you to search for specific pieces of code or text within the markup. The
              XQuery/XPath Builder is a useful tool for searching for specific instances of text.
                <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.9">See Appendix J, for further
                details on how to use the XQuery/XPath Builder</ref>. </item>

          <head>Edit Milestones</head>
          <p>Milestones should be generated automatically by the script before every <gi>p</gi>
            element and <gi>lg</gi> element; however, we don't use milestones as uniformly as this,
            and some of the milestones will need to be taken out (<ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.4"> for instructions on how to do this see
              appendix D</ref>). While editing in oXygen, it can be easier to edit milestones while
            in "author mode" (go to "Author" in the menu bar and click on "Switch to Author Mode").
            This will show the layout of the text more clearly and you can remove the milestones by
            double clicking on them and hitting delete.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Check the Alignment for Folio References</head>
          <p>Next we need to check to make sure the Folio References displayed on the web page are
            in alignment with the eKangyur. This require some minimal knowledge of Tibetan, so
            please have another editor check this for you if you don't know how to read Tibetan.</p>
          <p>When you check the web display on the Utilities page, go to the main translation and
            click on a folio reference, e.g., "[F.100.a]." This should cause the eKangyur text to
            pop up. Make sure that the eKangyur page that pops up is the correct page that
            corresponds to the English translation. You don't need to go through every folio in the
            text, just check the first two folio refs and the very last one.</p>
          <p>Most likely they will be aligned automatically and a correction will not be needed.
            However, due to a blank page or error in the eKangyur the alignment of the pages might
            be off by one or more pages. To fix the alignment we have created an .xml called "folio
            mapping" in apps &gt; 84000-data &gt; config &gt; folio-mapping.xml. It should look
            something like this:</p>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <folio-mappings xmlns="http://read.84000.co/ns/1.0">
              <mapping source="ekangyur" volume-add="126" page-multiplier="2" page-offset="-1">
                <range volume="31" start="1.b" end="91.a" page-offset="411"/>
                <range volume="31" start="92.b" end="397.a" page-offset="410"/>
                <range volume="90" start="63.a" end="63.a" page-offset="-2"/>
                <range volume="90" start="63.b" end="87.b" page-offset="-3"/>
                <range volume="90" start="150.b" end="156.a" page-offset="-3"/>
              </mapping>
            </folio-mappings>
          </egXML>
          <p>Here the "volume" corresponds to the volume of the text in the Degé (add 126 to this to
            find the corresponding eKangyur volume). "Start" and "end" should correspond to the text
            you need to adjust, and the "page-offset" will adjust the alignment up with a positive
            integer or down with a negative one. It should only need to be adjusted by one or two
            pages, but if you need to reference the eKangyur it can be found in apps &gt; eKangyur &gt; data &gt;
            UT4CZ5369 (don't use W4CZ5369).</p>
          <p>Note, that if the text contains duplicate versions within the Kangyur (such as Toh. 212/520/980), the folio alignment
          will need to be checked for each version individually.</p>
          <p>***Special Case for Volumes 81, 83, and 88 of the Degé Kangyur/eKangyur*** There is a variation
            due to the addition of texts in the post <hi rend="italic">par phud</hi> printings, which includes our
            eKangyur in volumes 81, 83 and 88, which are not in the <hi rend="italic">par phud</hi> printing 
            such as W22084. In volumes 81 and 83, this only concerns some texts added to the very end of the
            volume, but for volume 88 the Bodhimaṇḍasyālaṃkāralakṣadhāraṇī (byang chub snying po’i rgyan ’bum gyi gzungs)
            This work has the same Tibetan title as Toh 509, but a different Sanskrit title (Toh 509 is
            Bodhigarbhālaṃkāralakṣadhāraṇī). While this is confusing, it is also presumably the reason
            why the extra text was inserted at this point. If the orginal translator used a par phud printing
            this then off sets Volume 88 by 17 folios for all texts after Toh. 508. In this situation, because
            the folio references will not match up with those in the eKangyur, our solution has been to 
            put use both folio references. The one that links to the eKanyur will be the default <gi>ref</gi>
            element and the <gi>ref</gi> that refers to the alternate printing (likely W22084) should have this
            stated by a <att>work</att> attribute within the <gi>ref</gi> element. See for example from toh. 520:
          </p>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <ref cRef="F.41.a" work="W22084" key="520"/>
            <ref cRef="F.58.a" key="520"/>
          </egXML>
          <p>Here in the web display both references will be visible but only the one without the "work"
          attribute will have a clickable link to the eKangyur.</p>
          <!--Seems to all be updated to the config folder-->
          <!--<p>***To be updated soon*** Currently, we need to apply the same changes to the
            "folio-mapping.xml" file in apps > 84000-data > config > folio-mapping.xml as
            well as the one in the "source" file. Please edit both files when there is an alignment
            problem. These two files should be identical. In the future these will be consolidated
            into a single file, or the alignment will be taken from the markup in the eKangyur and
            the instructions for this step will be updated. </p>-->

          <head>Transform and Edit the Glossary</head>
          <list>
            <item>Before transforming the glossary in the Excel spreadsheet with the script, make
              sure that the spreadsheet is formatted properly. It should have three sheets labeled
              "Terms", "People", and "Places" (if the names of the sheets don't say this exactly, 
              the script won't apply the correct <att>type</att> to the <gi>gloss</gi> elements). Each sheet needs to have five columns that are
              exactly arranged as follows: (A) Tibetan Wylie, (B) Sanskrit, (C) Translation, (D) Definition, and
              (E) Alternatives.</item>
            <item>Note that occasionally you may get a spreadsheet with an additional column of Chinese 
            terms. If this is the case, there is a separate script for spreadsheets with Chinese. In
            this case the six columns should be arranged exactly as follows: (A) Tibetan Wylie, (B) Chinese, (C) Sanskrit, (D) Translation, (E) Definition, and
            (F) Alternatives.</item>
            <item>
              <hi rend="bold">Using a Macro to Correct Initial Apostrophes:</hi> When you receive a
              glossary file, in Excel, it’s likely there will be hidden apostrophes in the wylie
              column. This happens when a straight apostrophe is typed at the beginning of the word,
              as in the case of an a-chung prefix, "འ". Excel uses straight apostrophes to override
              the cell's format when typing numbers so that it considers it as text. In the process
              it hides this initial apostrophe, although there actually is an apostrophe in the
              cell, i.e., it disappears unless one actually clicks on the cell and looks in the text
              box at the top of the screen. In some cases the translator may have entered two
              apostrophes by mistake, or put one where their shouldn't be one. In all cases, these
              will need to be corrected, as the translator should not use straight apostrophes in
              the wylie text at all, but only use left curving apostrophes (’) (otherwise the script
              will not display proper Tibetan Unicode below them). To fix this you should run the
              following macro in Excel. This macro will convert each initial straight apostrophe.
              However, most often these are a spelling error in the wylie transliteration and will
              need to be corrected (each instance must be verified in a Tibetan dictionary). To make
              these instances easy to find, the macro also adds “111” so that it’s easy to make a
              search for these cells. The “111” is just a marker and will obviously need to be
              removed too.</item>
            <item>In case you don't know how to run a macro in Excel, there are many tutorials
              available on Youtube for both PC and Mac. There might be some differences depending on
              the version of your Excel software, but they should be pretty straightforward. You may
              be prevented from running a macro if the file is "shared"; you may have to go to the
              "Review" tab, click on "Share Workbook," and uncheck the box to share the file with
              other users (this might be slightly different on Mac). Then you should be able to run
              the macro without any problem. Here is the macro. Paste the following code into a
              module window and hit "run": <p> Sub AposChange()<lb/> Dim Rng As Range, Cell As
                Range<lb/> ThisWorkBook.Activate<lb/> Set Rng = Cells.SpecialCells(xlConstants)<lb/>
                Cells(Rows.Count, Columns.Count).Copy<lb/> For Each Cell In Rng<lb/> If
                Cell.PrefixCharacter = "'" Then<lb/> Cell.Value = "111 ’" + Cell.Value<lb/>
                Cell.PasteSpecial Operation:=xlPasteSpecialOperationAdd<lb/> End If<lb/> Next
                Cell<lb/> Application.CutCopyMode = False<lb/> End Sub</p>
            </item>
            <item> Here is an example. When you look at the spreadsheet you will see: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">’khor ba ’jig</egXML> But in the file there
              is actually a hidden apostrophe: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                '’khor ba ’jig</egXML>So after running the macro script it will become: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">111 ’’khor ba ’jig</egXML> In this example
              there should be no hesitation about what to remove, but in other cases you may need to
              check in the dictionary.</item>

            <item>Note, you might not be familiar with python script, python can be a bit finicky so
              go ahead and give it a try, but Celso and Mike can do these transformations later if
              you can’t get python running on your computer or if the script isn’t working properly.
              I couldn’t get the right version of python to run on my PC, but I did get it to run on
              my Mac. If you are able to get it on PC please add those instructions and update this
              checklist:</item>
            <item>
              <label>Running Python on Mac:</label>
              <list>
                <item>1. Download and install the latest version of Python 3. I believe the script
                  we use won’t work in Python 2. I use the mac version 3.6.3</item>
                <item>2. Now that you have python installed, create a folder on your desk top and
                  name it “convert” This will be the folder inside of which all your conversions
                  will occur. You will need to have Celso or Mike email the python script to you.
                  The script is a file labeled “convert-glossary-from-tei.py”. Put this file in the
                  “convert” folder you just created.</item>
                <item>3. First we need to convert the .xlsx file into an .xml file using oxgarage.
                  We can do this the same way we converted the .docx file earlier: convert from
                  spreadsheet > .xlsx to “TEI P5 XML Document” (Note, I’ve tried this with .xls
                  spreadsheets and it hasn’t worked, if this happens try saving the .xls as a .xlsx
                  with Excel and trying again. Also sometimes the Oxgarage will stop working and
                  then suddenly a week lately it will work again. Sorry, I know this is frustrating,
                  contact Celso or Mike if you are running into this hurdle.)</item>
                <item>4. Now take the .xml file converted from oxgarage and place it in the
                  “convert” folder on your desk top. Change the name of this .xml file to
                  “input.xml”</item>
                <item>5. Now we can run the script. The easiest way on the mac is to open an
                  application called IDLE, which comes with the python download. It should be in the
                  main Python folder after you install it.</item>
                <item>6. Open IDLE and go to “file > open” and open the
                  “convert-glossary-from-tei.py” file. This should open up a new window which will
                  show the script as a bunch of code. From this new window go to “Run > Run
                  Module”. This will run the script and create the converted file in the folder you
                  made with the name “output.xml”</item>
                <item>7. The script is finicky and often times it won’t work. Sometimes is will
                  break halfway through and the file will be incomplete. If you get an error message
                  open up the “input.xml” file with oxygen or any text editor. The most likely
                  problem is that there is an empty row in the spreadsheet that is causing the
                  script to break. For instance you will see in the text rows labeled as <row
                  n="1"> followed by a bunch of <cells> and then <row n=”2”> and so
                  forth. Most of the <cells> had the data from the .xslx file, but see if you
                  can find where the <row> is suddenly followed by a bunch of empty unused
                  cells. Delete those empty cells (just for that row) and try running the script
                  again. If it still isn’t working you can try sending it to me (Celso) and I can
                  try to find out why it isn’t working.</item>

            <item>
              <hi rend="bold">Continuing with step A.6 Transforming and Editing the Glossary:</hi>
              If you get the script to work, or have someone else convert it for you, you can then
              paste it into the XML text you are working on. Use another already-published TEI file
              as a model.</item>
            <item>The script should be able to convert all three sheets in the combined .xlsx file
              in one go and create the appropriate type attribute (term, person, or place) if the
              sheets were labeled properly. However, if one of the sheets isn't converting properly,
              try breaking the three sheets into three separated .xlsx files and converting each one
              individually.</item>
            <item>Edit the glossary. Note that when you save the file to the database it will add
              the “xml:id” automatically so you don’t need to worry about adding these. You will
              probably need to remove several empty <gi>item</gi> elements that were converted from
              empty cells at the bottom of each sheet. Also remove entries that were converted from
              the spreadsheet's headings i.e., Tibetan, Sanskrit, Translation, Definition,
              etc.</item>
            <item>If the script "oxGto84000-gloss.xsl-wChinese" was used, the script assumes that the Chinese terms will be typed in Chinese characters
            and will be set to xml:lang="zh" by default.</item>
            <item>Note that the database will also automatically generate Tibetan script and add it as a
              &lt;term xml:lang="bo"/&gt; element based on the Wylie glossary entries. The
              code should look within the glossary for any &lt;term xml:lang="Bo-Ltn"/&gt; and create the matching "bo" term
              wherever there isn't one. So be sure to save the file, close it, reopen, and check that
              the Tibetan entries have been properly added. 
            </item>
            <item>Check for errors and make sure the tags are nested properly. Use a
              previously-edited 84000 TEI XML as a model. You might want to save it first so that it
              automatically adds all the attributes and so forth.</item>
            <item>Note that any italics used in the definitions for glossary items need to be entered in manually. By default the script will place
              all italics found in the definitions column into &lt;title xml:lang=""&gt; tags, but you
            will need to go in and change some of these into <gi>foreign</gi> tags where appropriate and
            add the proper <att>type</att> and <att>xml:lang</att> attributes as needed.</item>

          <p>Create links for any references in the text, e.g., "<hi rend="italic">see page
            ###</hi>" or "<hi rend="italic">see Bibliography</hi>." Links for in-text references are
            created with the <gi>ptr</gi> element and external references (to other 84000 texts or
            other web pages) are created with the <gi>ref</gi> element. For further guidelines for
            creating links with the <gi>ptr</gi> and <gi>ref</gi> elements see <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.2_div.4">Appendix B.4:Cross References and

          <head>Upload the XML and See How it Looks on the Web Page</head>
          <list>
            <item>Go through the text again in web display, making sure everything looks
              okay.</item>
            <item>It is helpful at this point to put the web page in “editor mode.” This
              underlines the linked glossary terms for you. Otherwise, in the regular display, it
              underlines them but then they will disappear after a few seconds, which will be
              frustrating when your are checking the links. An additional benefit of editor mode is that all of the collapsed sections
              of the text (Intro, Translation, Notes, etc...) will be expanded by default, so that you can
              more easily search for terms in the web display with CTRL-F.
              To put the page in editor mode, simply
              add the following text to the end of the URL web address:
                <code>?view-mode=editor</code>
            </item>
            <item>At this point you should check to see that the glossary is linking to the right
              terms. In the summary and introduction in particular there may be many instances of a
              word linking to the glossary when it shouldn’t, for example in the phrase “in terms
              of…” the word “term” might link to the glossary for the technical meaning of “term”;
              or to take another example, in the phrase “with respect to…” the word “respect” might
              link to “respect” as in devotion (these are just two out of many examples). To fix
              these instances you should add the <att>mode</att> attribute to the <gi>gloss</gi>
              element in the glossary. If the mode is set to mode="match" (this is the default mode,
              by the way), you will be able to block strings in the text you don't want to link by
              marking them with the tag <tag>term type="ignore"</tag>. If you change it to
              mode="marked", it will only link with strings in the text that are tagged with the
                <gi>term</gi> element (you will need to mark each instance of the term individually
              in this case). In rare cases you might need to use both modes. For example, in Toh.
              127 there are two gloss entries for the term "conceptualization," and there are some
              instances of this word that should link to the first gloss, some that should link to
              the second, and some that should link to neither. In this case the first gloss it set
              to mode="marked" and the second has the default mode="match", then terms that should
              link to the first are marked with the <gi>term</gi> element, the ones that should link
              to the second are left untagged, and the terms that should link to neither are marked
                <tag>term type="ignore"</tag>.</item>
            <item>In these cases you can save yourself some time when choosing between the "marked"
              or "match" modes. It is good to think about which mode will require the least amount
              of tags. Usually this will be the default "match" mode, but it varies from case to
              case.</item>
            <item>If there are any instances in the web display where there is a term in the
              glossary that is showing "0 instances in this text" (in the right-hand column of the
              glossary), you should find out if that term is actually in the text. There may be a
              spelling error, a diacritic error, or some other reason why it isn't linking to the
              glossary entry. Sometimes there is a glossary term that really isn't in the text
              (possibly because it was in the introduction and later removed). If this is the case
              make a note about it in the final list of questions and issues to address when you
              have finished the text.</item>
            <item>There are several subtle points for polishing the final glossary, so we have
              created a separate Appendix C that explains how the glossary works, along with a few
              further tips for editing it. <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.3">Please take a look at Appendix C here.</ref>

          <head>Final Details</head>
          <p>A few final things to look out for while going through your final run of the text:</p>
          <list>
            <item>Check for extra blank spaces.</item>
            <item>Double check links and make sure they go to the right places.</item>
            <item>Make sure links aren't missing. Sometimes if the little "#" is missing or
              misplaced in the "target" attribute in the <gi>ptr</gi>s then the reference won't
              appear at all and you will see text like "(see above, .)" without anything coming
              after it.</item>
            <item>Do a search for comment tags that may refer to issues that haven't been addressed.
              To find them you can do a quick search for "&lt;!--".</item>
            <item>Address any final schema errors. Occasionally, the schema may need to be updated
              to accommodate a new type of formatting. Or, if a note uses a term in a language that
              hasn't been used in a published text yet, then that ISO 639-1 code may need to be
              added to the schema. In either case make a note about this for your final list of
              questions and issues.</item>
            <item>Note any formatting or anything else that just looks wrong or awkward.</item>
            <item>Make note of any grammar or editing errors that you think may have been missed in
              the copy editing phase. You can also add this to your final list of questions and
              issues.</item>
            <item>As you work on the text, make a running list of any problems or issues that you
              cannot fix yourself and make this into a final list of questions and issues. There are
              often a lot of things that come up; some of them should be addressed by the lead
              editor, and some issues may need be updated in the schema or addressed by the
              technician. This list should be pasted into the <ref target="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rcjhn4k4MixKAyogvAwxkxCVHG7avXn5W0WqhcYdkdw/edit?ts=5b802eba#gid=582485615">Reading Room Revisions spreadsheet, which you can access through this link</ref>.
              There are several sheets within this document. Use the sheet entitled "Texts in
              Markup" and create a new heading for the text you are working on. Inform the lead
              editor when you are finished with this list, and we can work on addressing all of
              these final issues as a team. Read further instructions for how to post issues within
              the Reading Room Revisions sheet itself, at the top of the "Texts in Markup"
              page.</item>
            <item>If there are any schema updates needed, or if there are any parts of this TEI
              editor's checklist that need to be clarified or updated you can contact Celso to make
              those updates. You can either assign the task to him on the Reading Room Revisions
              Sheet or email him at celso.wilkinson@gmail.com.</item>

          <head>Italics</head>
          <p>In a given text, words or phrases may be italicized for different reasons. The need to
            express both presentation information (that text is italicized) as well as the semantic
            information about why it is italicized must be addressed. That is why instead of simply
            using the <gi>hi</gi> element, for example, the voices below form the markup menu for
            text that needs to be italicized: </p>
          <list>
            <item>
              <gi>distinct</gi> terms, words, or phrases singled out (in any language, but use this
              only when a "foreign" tag is not applicable).</item>
            <item>
              <gi>emph</gi> words or phrases italicized for emphasis or rhetorical effect. </item>
            <item>
              <tag>foreign xml:lang=""</tag> foreign words or phrases in any language.</item>
            <item>
              <tag>foreign type="term" xml:lang=""</tag> a foreign term or phrase other than a quote
              or title, such as a term or phrase in parentheses following its translation, or a
              foreign term or phrase left untranslated. </item>
            <item>
              <tag>title xml:lang=""</tag> title of a work (in any language). </item>
            <item>
              <tag>foreign xml:lang="__-Ltn"</tag> Wylie or other type of Roman transliteration
              (excluding European languages, which should not have the "-Ltn" appendage). </item>
            <item>
              <tag>foreign type="quote" xml:lang=""</tag> quotations from other texts. </item>
            <item>
              <tag>foreign type="mantra" xml:lang=""</tag> mantras or seed syllables. </item>
          </list>
          <p>Note that Tibetan script and Chinese characters should be given the xml:lang value of
            "bo" and "zh" respectively, while Tibetan, Chinese, and Sanskrit romanized
            transliteration should have the values of "Bo-Ltn," "Zh-Ltn," and "Sa-Ltn" respectively.
            For other languages use the list of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">ISO 639-1 codes</ref>
            to find the appropriate xml:lang value. Most often an Asian language will be translated
            into the Roman script and, therefore, the first letter of the ISO 639-1 code should be
            capitalized followed by "-Ltn". Thus a Thai term "th" in Romanized script should be
            coded "Th-Ltn." If the term is a European language or the native script of that language
            is used, then use the two letter code as usual, e.g., "fr" (French), "la" (Latin),
            etc.</p>
          <p>For the most part, these tags should be added during the copy editing phase in the
            84000 Template.docx. In this phase they will be added as styles in MS Word, but will be
            transformed into the appropriate tag by our scripts. However, as we can't add a style
            for every language in the template, the markup editor will need look up and edit the
            tags for any uncommon languages, which will be marked through the script as
            xml:lang="Input Language." The markup editor should also keep an eye out for errors, or
            italicized text that was missed. However, the script should render all unmarked italics
            with a "&lt;fix&gt;" tag, which will be highlighted as an error by the schema.</p>

        <div>
          <head>Divisions</head>
          <p>Div elements are used to mark different sections within a text. This is of particular
            importance as the <gi>head</gi> tag can only follow directly after a "div" marker or
            another <gi>head</gi> tag. The main sections of the text are marked as follows:</p>
          <list>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="summary"</tag> Wraps the Summary section.</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="acknowledgement"</tag> Wraps the Acknowledgement section.</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="prologue"</tag> Wraps the Prologue (if there is one).</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="preface"</tag> Wraps the Preface (if there is one).</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="introduction"</tag> Wraps the Introduction.</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="translation"</tag> Wraps the entire translation.</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="notes"</tag> Wraps the notes section; this section is needed for
              displaying abbreviations.</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="listBibl"</tag> Contains a group of bibl elements, wraps the
              bibliography.</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="appendix"</tag> To wrap the appendix of a text, e.g. a Sanskrit
              Appendix (if there is one).</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="colophon</tag> Wraps the colophon.</item>
          </list>
          <p>Within those major document units or divisions, there are other sub units, especially
            chapters or their equivalent. Both chapter and section refer to the same hierarchical
            level in the XML. Chapters are the type value used in the body of the text when they
            have been specified as chapters by the translator. Section is used for equivalent level
            sectioning that has not been called a chapter. Examples for the latter are sectioned
            bibliographies, where the whole of the bibliography has multiple sections organized by
            source type. In that case <tag>div type="section"</tag> is used instead of <tag>div
              type="chapter"</tag>. From a structural point of view, however, they are the same.</p>
          <list>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="chapter"</tag> Wraps a chapter that is part of the translation.</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="section"</tag> Wraps a section of the TEI document.</item>

          <head>Outlines</head>
          <p>Sometimes the introduction of a text will provide an outline, particularly in the case
            of a longer or more complicated text. Within the TEI XML these outlines should be
            constructed using the <gi>list</gi> and <gi>item</gi> elements. For a complex outline
            with many levels of subsections, the outline itself should be contained in a list, and
            each section should be contained in an <gi>item</gi> within that list. Then, for each
            sub section, a new <gi>list</gi> element should be nested within those <gi>item</gi>s,
            which in turn contains its own subsections with <gi>item</gi> elements, and so forth for
            as many subsections as necessary. Note that if the <gi>list</gi> is marked up as
            type="bullet" it will be indented. A good way to render the outline in a clear way is to
            mark up the first list as type="section" and all subsequent lists as type="bullet"; then
            the major sections will be separated by vertical spacing and all the subsections will be
            indented. <ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh116.html#UT22084-051-004-45">For an example see the following outline from "The Baskets Display" (Toh 116):</ref>

          <p>This will allow the outline to be properly displayed in the 84000 reading room. For

            alternation however they are needed, just note that "section" will have vertical spacing
            between each item, and "bullet" will be indented.</p>
          <p>The <gi>head</gi> element resting within the <gi>list</gi> tag, but outside of the

                      of wisdom which bodhisattvas are to perfect, Lord Buddha replies that it is
                      the absence of fixation with respect to all phenomena, all meditative
                      experiences, all causal attributes acquired by bodhisattvas, all fruitional

                      omniscience. along with unconditioned phenomena, such as the abiding nature of
                      all things and the finality of existence, these are all attributes with
                      respect to which a great bodhisattva being should cultivate detachment.
                      Bodhisattvas do perceive such phenomena distinctly, but only on the relative
                      level; in an ultimate sense they consider them to be illusory, in the manner
                      of a dream and so forth. </p>

          <label>Milestones:</label>
          <p>Cross references in the text that refer to milestones will be added using a
              <gi>ptr</gi> element with the "target" attribute. The value of the target should be a
            hashmark ("#") followed by the xml:id value of the milestone that is to be linked. For
            example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> See <ptr target="#UT22084-060-005-1"/><!--2.3-->. </egXML> The milestone number as it appears
            on the webpage may be listed as a comment afterwards, but the parser will automatically
            show the milestone number in the web display. This way even if the milestones shift
            around it will still display and link to the correct milestone on the web page. </p>
          <lb/>
          <label>Notes and Bibliography:</label>
          <p>Notes and Bibliography entries work in exactly the same way:, for the target attribute,
            simply use the xml:id value contained in the <gi>note</gi> or <gi>bibl</gi> element that
            needs to be linked. You can also link to the general bibliography section with the
            target value "#bibliography." For example:</p>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <note>See <ptr target="#bibliography">bibliography</ptr>

          <lb/>
          <label>Links to Other Texts or Web Addresses:</label>
          <p>If there is a link to a milestone in a different text, rather than using a
            <gi>ptr</gi>, the <gi>ref</gi> element is used, which should also have a "target"
            attribute followed by the URL address of the text, followed by a hash tag, followed by
            the xml:id of the milestone in that other text. For example:</p>

          <p>Links to other websites can be made with the <gi>ref</gi> element in the same

        <head>Guidelines for Glossary</head>
        <head>Some Notes About How the Glossary Works:</head>
        <label rend="bold">How Reader Handles Plurals:</label>
        <p>A term will be matched if it is followed by s, es, 's, or s' and then a non-word
          character, e.g. Maitreya, Maitreya's, Maitreyas. (Unfortunately, the general marker for
          non-word characters is not Sanskrit-aware. It handles Sanskrit diacritic characters as
          non-word characters. While we have handled most of the related issues in this case it can
          result in a few mistakes, e.g. Maitreyasāyana).</p>
        <label rend="bold">Use of the <gi>term</gi> Tag to Mark the Same Word Used in Different
          Ways:</label>
        <p>Sometimes we will only want certain instances of a string of text to be marked as a
          glossary term. For example, perhaps we want the term "appropriate" to be linked to this
          term when it is used as verb but not when it used as an adjective. Note, that we are no
          longer using zero-width-non-joiners to resolve this issue. Instead, we now use the "mode"
          attribute within the <gi>gloss</gi> element. </p>
        <p>In the glossary, <gi>gloss</gi> nodes can be given the attributes mode="match|marked."
          Match mode will highlight any matches in the text except where they have been marked up
          with <tag>term type="ignore"</tag>, e.g.: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">parse this <term type="ignore">but not this</term>
          </egXML> Marked mode will only match terms that have been marked up with <gi>term</gi>
          e.g. <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Ignore this <term>but match
              this</term>.</egXML>
        </p>
        <!--Currently we are not using priorities-->
        <!--<label>Use of priorities</label>
          <p>Some glossary terms overlap. If a word is found in more than one glossary item then the database will set a priority attribute on the related <gloss> items. Precedence is given to glossary items with a higher priority. By default the priority is derived from the number of words in the phrase. This can be manually overridden by setting the attribute as you wish and saving it. In the following example instances of the term "inconceivable liberation" will be given precedence over "inconceivable" when the text is glossarised.
            <gloss priority="1">
              <term>inconceivable</term>
            </gloss>
            <gloss priority="2">
              <term>inconceivable liberation</term>
            </gloss>
          </p>-->
        <label rend="bold">How Tibetan Is Created from Wylie:</label>
        <p>Where a glossary item has a Wylie term but no Tibetan the database will auto-generate the
          Tibetan. To re-create a Tibetan term simply remove the node, save, and refresh. The Wylie
          string will also have a trailing space enforced. These will produce the respective
          syllable separators in the Tibetan. Double underscores in Wylie will be replaced with a
          single space when output to the reader. </p>
        <label rend="bold">Links to Paragraphs with Instances:</label>
        <p>The reader lists links to each paragraph that includes instances of a glossary term.</p>
        <label rend="bold">For Multiple Tibetan and Sanskrit Forms of Spelling for a Single
          Term:</label>
        <p>In some cases a single <gi>gloss</gi> entry may have multiple forms for spelling the
          Tibetan, the Sanskrit, or both. In this case each spelling of the term can be listed
          separately in its own <gi>term</gi> element. However, Tibetan should be listed first,
          followed by the Sanskrit, as in the following example for the term "karnikara" (note that
          a Tibetan "bo" term is auto-generated after each instance of Tibetan Wylie "Bo-Ltn"):</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <gloss type="term" xml:id="UT22084-055-001-5217">
            <term>karnikara</term>
            <term xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">kar ni </term>
            <term xml:lang="bo">ཀར་ནི།</term>
            <term xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dong ka </term>
            <term xml:lang="bo">དོང་ཀ།</term>
            <term xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dkar ni </term>
            <term xml:lang="bo">དཀར་ནི།</term>
            <term xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">karṇikāra</term>
            <term xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">mucilinda</term>
            <term type="definition">Pterospermum acerifolium. Other names include bayur, muchakunda,
              muchalinda, and dinner-plate tree.</term>
          </gloss>
        </egXML>
        <p>Note that in the example above, these spelling variations are supplied by the author but
          don't actually appear in the translated text. If there are alternative spellings of a term
          within the text itself, they need to be marked as type="alternative."</p>
        <label rend="bold">Use of Alternatives in the Glossary Entry:</label>
        <p>Glossary items can also include <tag>term type="alternative"</tag> nodes to specify other
          variations in the spelling that should be marked in the text: </p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <term>Mañjuśrī</term>
          <term type="alternative">Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta</term>
        </egXML>
        <label rend="bold">Further Explanation on the Mode Attribute:</label>
        <p>The mode attribute is not required, but when present it can either be "match" or
          "marked." "Match" is the default (where this attribute is not specified). "Match" will
          behave in the normal way: the text is scanned for glossary matches and highlighted
          accordingly.</p>
        <p>"Marked," on the other hand, will only consider text strings that have been marked up
          with <gi>term</gi>. An example for "appropriate" is below: </p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <!-- Glossary item with mode "marked" -->
          <item>

              <term xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">len pa </term>
              <term xml:lang="bo">ལེན་པ་</term>
              <term xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ādāna</term>
              <term type="definition">See “appropriation.”</term>

        <label rend="bold">Some Final Tips for Polishing the Glossary:</label>
        <list>
          <item>Sometimes a term will appear in its own definition. In this case it looks a bit
            silly for the term to link to itself, so it would be best to mark it with <tag>term
              type="ignore"</tag>.</item>
          <item>If there are references in the definition to a term, such as "see also...", they can
            be placed into a second <tag>term type="definition"</tag> line, to create some visual
            lightness in the final webdisplay.</item>
          <item>If a word is not linking in the webdisplay, here are some common causes for
            instances not being detected by the parser: <list>
              <item>Plurals in the middle of strings of words (where the "s" doesn't come at the
                end).</item>
              <item>An extra space at the end of the term in the glossary.</item>
              <item>Sanskrit soft-hypens in the term not matching with the glossary entry.</item>
            </list>
          </item>
          <item>Occasionally you will see a word in the text that is similar to a glossary term but
            isn't linked because it takes as different form. For instance, "appropriate" is in the
            glossary, but you see "appropriation" in the text. If you see instances like this you
            can add an <tag>term type="alternative"</tag> to that <gi>gloss</gi> item, but be sure
            that you are not then linking to other unwanted instances as well.</item>

        <head>Guidelines for Entering Milestones into the TEI Document</head>
        <p>Milestones are applied to the document with the “<tag>milestone unit="chunk"/</tag>” tag.
          Because the 84000 reading room does not have page numbers, milestones are particularly
          important for referencing sections or paragraphs in the text.</p>
        <p>Milestones should be applied to the text at places where there is a logical/thematic
          division in the text. Often, milestones can be placed at the beginning of each paragraph
          of prose. In cases where paragraphs are very short (only one or two sentences) milestones
          can be placed one for every two or more paragraphs depending on the context, or a
          particularly short paragraph can share the milestone with that of a larger previous or
          later paragraph that shares the same “theme.”</p>
        <p> To a large degree the editor should use their own judgment: If the milestones are too
          frequent, then it will become distracting to the reader on the page. If they are too far
          apart, it will be difficult to cite particular passages of the text. It is helpful to
          check the display in the reading room after applying milestones to make sure they appear
          in a convenient way.</p>
        <p>Often there will be very short paragraphs used during sections of dialogue. A logical way
          to organize these sections is to allow one question and answer to be given a single
          milestone. For example, the following passage could be given one milestone: </p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <milestone unit="chunk"/>
          <p>The Lord then said to the venerable Śāriputra, “Śāriputra, did you see that universe
            Abhirati, and the Tathāgata Akṣobhya?”</p>
          <p>Śāriputra replied, “I saw it, Lord! May all living beings come to live in a buddhafield
            as splendid as that! May all living beings come to have miraculous powers just like
            those of the noble Licchavi Vimalakīrti!</p>
        </egXML>
        <p>If either the question or the answer are very short paragraphs (one or two sentences),
          then they could be appended to the milestone along with their respective question and
          answer. However, if both the question and answer are long paragraphs in themselves, they
          should each be given their own milestone. Of course, there will always be unique
          situations such as questions being answered with another question and so forth. The editor
          should in general use their own discretion to decide what frequency of milestones would be
          the most useful and least distracting to the reader. They should to try to be consistent
          with their usage. </p>
        <p>When entering milestones for lines of verse, the editor should apply milestones in a
          consistent manner, which will typically be one milestone marker between every line group
          element <gi>lg</gi>. Usually this will be a verse of four lines in English. </p>
        <p>For example, see how milestones are applied to the following verses from The Teachings of
          Vimalakīrti: </p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

            <l>Immeasurable is the ocean of your virtues, the accumulation of your good deeds.</l>
            <l>You affirm the path of peace. O Great Ascetic, obeisance to you!</l>

          <p>Vimalakīrti: Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva who is terrified by fear of life should resort to

        <p>Here the editor might place a milestone for each item in the list depending on the length
          of each paragraph. It might also be appropriate to place the milestones according to
          logical groupings in the list, for example place one milestone for the four immeasurables,
          one milestone for the six paramitas, etc. Finally, if the list becomes overburdened by
          milestones, the editor can add the milestones for every two or four items in the list. In
          this case it might be worthwhile to check how many items there are in the list then seek a
          reasonable way to divide it up evenly. </p>
        <p>In general, it’s most important to think of milestone placement according to logical
          connections and divisions within the text itself. Try to group long paragraphs with
          shorter ones if the shorter paragraph is concluding the ideas of the longer paragraph; try
          to group items in a list that are related; try to group questions and answers together
          (where the question gets the milestone and the answer shares the same milestone without
          getting its own). If there are no logical groupings and many short paragraphs or items in
          a list, then try to apply consistently according to number (e.g. every two paragraphs, or
          every four, etc). </p>
        <p>If the editor is not sure about the frequency for applying milestones, he or she can
          refer to some of the other texts in the reader and see how frequently the milestones are
          used in other texts. </p>
        <p>While editing in oXygen, it can be easier to edit milestones while in "author mode" (go
          to "Author" in the menu bar and click on "Switch to Author Mode." This will show the
          layout of the text more clearly and you can remove the milestones by double clicking on
          them and hitting delete.)</p>

        <head>Guidelines for Entering Soft Hyphens to Sanskrit</head>
        <p>Note that only editors with a basic understanding of the spelling and sandhi rules of
          Sanskrit should proceed with this step. You don't need to be an expert in Sanskrit, as
          most words can be looked up in online references, however, for this step editors will need
          to have a clear grasp on how the sandhi rules in Sanskrit work. If not please request that
          another editor with this skill to complete this task.</p>
        <list>
          <item>Look for long Sanskrit chains, and add optional soft-hyphens at points where there
            are chains that are 15+ characters long. Optional soft-hyphens are created with the
            character code: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">&amp;#173;</egXML>Note
            that after you save the XML these will look like regular hyphens, but if you move the
            blinking cursor to the space just before the hyphen you will notice there is a different
            character code displayed at the bottom of the oXygen screen.</item>
          <item>The long Sanskrit chains can be found easily by going to Window &gt; Show View &gt;
            XPath/XQuery Builder, then in the XPath/XQuery Builder window type the following code
            and press the red play button:<code>//*[string-length(string()) &gt; 14 and @xml:lang
              ='Sa-Ltn']</code> You can save this query for later by clicking on the star and
            choosing "add to favourites."</item>
          <item>Be careful when adding the soft hyphens as they should only be placed at certain
            points in the words where they do not interfere with the Sanskrit rules of sandhi. When
            adding the soft hyphens please follow the following guidelines:</item>
          <item>
            <label>Guidelines for Adding Soft-Hyphens to Sanskrit:</label>
            <list>
              <item>
                <p>1. As we are not using full justification anyway, (a) most Sanskrit words don’t
                  need hyphenation unless they are longer than 5 or 6 syllables, but (b) may be
                  necessary for shorter words especially in text titles on the title page. I
                  therefore tend to place soft hyphens in all of the text titles, in verse passages,
                  in the bibliography entries, and in notes and glossary entries (which require
                  shorter lines in general).</p>
              </item>
              <item>
                <p>2. Place a soft hyphen (a) only between the words of a compound; (b) even then
                  only when there are no changes brought about by sandhi (because putting a hyphen
                  would logically mean undoing the sandhi, and the hyphens we’re talking about may
                  or may not appear); and (c) avoiding confusing remnants.</p>
                <p>A couple of examples:</p>
                <p>Ratnagotravibhāgottaratantraśāstra would be
                  Ratna-gotra-vibhāgottara-tantra-śāstra. If we divided the 5-syllable sequence in
                  the middle, that would have to undo the sandhi and become -vibhāga-uttara-, which
                  only works in the presence of a hard hyphen. Theoretically we could put a hyphen
                  at vi-bhāga, but that would risk leaving us with -gotravi-, which would be
                  potentially confusing to read.</p>
                <p>The maximum we could hyphenate antānantaḍṛṣṭivāsanābhisaṃdhisamuccedaka would be
                  antānanta-ḍṛṣṭi-vāsanābhi-saṃdhi-sam-ucchedaka, because antānanta and
                  vāsanābhi-saṃdhi would become anta-ananta and vāsana-abhi-saṃdhi. In a case like
                  that, I would also prefer to avoid ending up with
                  antānantaḍṛṣṭivāsanābhi-saṃdhisamuccedaka, because the abhi- really belongs with
                  the saṃdhi; it’s a possible break but is confusing to read.</p>
              </item>
              <item>One resource that is helpful for determining the breaks in Sanskrit chains in
                the online <ref target="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/awork/apidev/sample/list-0.2.html">Cologne Sanskrit Dictionary</ref>. This one is really helpful because it has a
                drop down menu of similarly spelled words when you hit the enter key, however, I
                think this only works when you use the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard-Kyoto">Kyoto-Harvard Transliteration
                  scheme</ref> "KH." You might try the other ones but I found that this is the only
                one that gave the drop down list for me. Then when you find a big word in the
                dictionary in the definition entry you will see * whenever there is sandhi, though
                this isn't 100% reliable. Sometimes it is missing for some reason, so be careful if
                the spelling looks weird.</item>
              <item>In certain cases there may be long 15+ Sanskrit chains that cannot be broken due
                to the sandhi, or long Sanskrit compounds whose pieces cannot be easily determined
                with online resources. If this is the case make a list of problematic instances to
                note for the leading editors, and also check these instances to see if the pose any
                major difficultly for the web display. These instances are rare, but they do come up
                now and then.</item>
              <item>It is acceptable to add an optional hyphen at the end of "mahā-" as in
                "mahā-yāna" even though technically the long ā would be lost, as this is a well
                known word and unlikely to be misread.</item>
              <item>Note that when you add the optional hyphens to a glossary item where the
                translation uses the Sanskrit (This will mainly be in the “Persons” and “Places”
                section of the glossary) the hyphens will have to match all those instances within
                the body of the text or they will not link to the glossary term, so it is best to
                start from the glossary and work your way backwards. For all of these person and
                place terms do a search and replace so that the hyphens match in all the instances
                of that term (be cautious when doing large search-and-replaces that you don’t make
                any unintended changes).</item>

        <head>Guidelines and Checklist for Updating the Schema and ODD</head>
        <p>Note that updating the schema and ODD is a bit more complicated, so this should be
          handled by the lead editors or technicians. Otherwise, if you are working on a markup and
          notice that the schema needs to be updated (i.e., there is some markup needed but you are
          getting a schema error for that markup), then make this a point to send to the lead
          editors in your final list of questions and issues for finalizing the text. Please
          disregard the following instructions unless you are a lead editor or technician.</p>
        <list>
          <item>This appendix gives a brief explanation and checklist for how to update the ODD.
              <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TD.html">However, you
              may need to refer to the 22nd chapter of the TEI guidelines</ref> for a more detailed
            explanation on how the elements in the ODD work. You may also need to refer to the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/USE.html">23rd chapter of
              the TEI guidelines</ref> which contains information on the content models, attribute
            customizations, and TEI conformance.</item>
          <item>Most of the restrictions in the ODD are defined in the element specifications. In
            order to create documentation, an <gi>elementSpec</gi> has been created for all of the
            elements we use. There are also some schema restrictions defined in class
            specifications, <gi>classSpec</gi>, and macro specifications, <gi>macroSpec</gi>. In our
            ODD's XML the <gi>classSpec</gi>s are listed first followed by the <gi>macroSpec</gi>s
            followed by the <gi>elementSpec</gi>s all in alphabetical order. If you need to jump to
            a specific element, they can easily be found by searching for their <att>ident</att>
            attribute. For example, to find the <gi>elementSpec</gi> for the "front", search for
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">c ident="front"</egXML> and this will
            take you to that section of the ODD.</item>
          <item>Adding new elements will require creating a new <gi>elementSpec</gi> and adding it
            to the ODD. Adding or modifying attributes can be done in that specific element's
              <gi>attList</gi>. For example here is the <gi>attList</gi> for the <gi>title</gi>
            element: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <attList>
                <attDef ident="type" mode="change">
                  <desc>classifies the title according to the TBRC typology.</desc>
                  <desc>classifies the title according to the 84000 typology.</desc>
                  <valList type="closed" mode="replace">
                    <valItem ident="mainTitle"/>
                    <valItem ident="longTitle"/>
                    <valItem ident="otherTitle"/>
                  </valList>
                </attDef>
                <attDef ident="xml:id" mode="delete"/>
                <attDef ident="level" mode="delete"/>
                <attDef ident="xml:lang" mode="change" usage="req"/>
              </attList>
            </egXML> The <gi>attDef</gi> defines a particular attribute for <gi>title</gi>, along
            with a description <gi>desc</gi>. The <gi>valList</gi> defines what values are allowed
            in the "type" attribute. Since we don't use the default "xml:id" and "level" attributes
            in our <gi>title</gi>s they have been set to "delete" so they won't appear in our
            documentation. We want the "xml:lang" to be required for all <gi>title</gi>s so the
            usage has been set to "reg". More details should can be found in the TEI guidelines. </item>
          <item> When a language needs to be added to the schema, the language list is actually
            found in the class specification for "att.global" that defines the "xml:lang" attribute.
            It should be added here so it will apply to all the elements that use "xml:lang". To
            find this section search for <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> attDef
              ident="xml:lang" </egXML>

            <hi rend="bold">Content Models:</hi> The structure for the schema--i.e., what elements
            are allowed to be nested in what elements--are contained in the ODD content models,
              <gi>content</gi>. Because the 84000 schema is very restrictive, we use relax ng
            content models to define the structure of the text. To keep it as simple as possible we
            have put the main content models in just four places in the ODD: The <gi>front</gi>,
              <gi>body</gi>, <gi>back</gi>, and <gi>teiHeader</gi>. To make changes to the content
            models go to the <gi>elementSpec</gi>s for these elements and make the changes in their
              <gi>content</gi>. In some cases we needed to place content models in the child
            elements of these four, but in this case you will see that the content model refers to a
            child element for example the content model of the <gi>teiHeader</gi> refers to <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <rng:ref name="publicationStmt"/>
            </egXML> This means that it will use in this instance the content model that has been
            declared in the <gi>content</gi> of the <gi>publicationStmt</gi>'s
            <gi>elementSpec</gi>.</item>
          <item>To avoid writing repetitive code, there are also some content models declared in the
              <gi>marcroSpec</gi> these may be referred to in other content models, which will look
            something like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <rng:ref name="paragraph"/>
            </egXML> In this example the rng element points to the content model of our basic
            paragraph. And if that needs to be updated in can be done so in the <gi>macroSpec</gi>
            for "paragraph". </item>
          <item>Note there are also many descriptions, <gi>desc</gi>, as well as examples
              <gi>egXML</gi> contained in all the specifications. It is not required to update these
            for the generation of the schema, but when you make in update, it would be good to
            update these as well so that our documentation can be most up to date. Also consider
            whether an update is something that the markup editors need to be aware of during their
            work flow. If it is, please add some explanation and/or protocol for the markup editors
            in the "Checklist for 84000 TEI Markup Editors". This appendix is found in the
              <gi>back</gi> of the ODD.</item>
          <item>Occasionally, we may add a new element to our schema that is already included in 
            one of the standard TEI modules. Note, that these standard elements are all declared at
            the beginning of the ODD in the <gi>moduleRef</gi>. This happened to me, I couldn't figure
            out why the <gi>hi</gi> element wasn't validating even though it was declared in an <gi>elementSpec</gi>.
            The reason was I had assumed it was declared as a part of the "core" module, but had forgotten 
            to add it to the list within the <gi>moduleRef</gi>.            
          </item>
          <item>If you can't figure out why an added element or attribute isn't validating properly for a
          schema update. A good technique is to paste that element into a TEI document apply the schema, and 
          read the schema error message at the bottom of the oXygen window. It should tell you what the 
          schema is expecting and based on that you can determine where and which content model needs to 
          be updated. Also keep in mind that any element from the standard TEI modules will have the default 
          content model if a new one isn't declared, so <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/REF-ELEMENTS.html">you may need to look up the element in the TEI guidelines</ref>
          to find its default content model as well as its other parameters.</item>
          <item> To summarize here is a brief checklist for any updates for the ODD/schema. <list>
              <item>1) Make any changes to the element that needs update in that elements
                  <gi>elementSpec</gi>
              </item>
              <item>2) Does this change need to be reflected in the content model? If so make the
                appropriate corrections to the <gi>content</gi> found within the
                  <gi>elementSpec</gi>s for the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, <gi>front</gi>, <gi>body</gi>,
                  <gi>back</gi>, or possibly one of the <gi>macroSpec</gi>s</item>
              <item>3) Update examples, <gi>egXML</gi> and/or descriptions <gi>desc</gi> if
                needed.</item>
              <item>4) Update the markup editor's checklist if needed.</item>

        <head>Further Useful Tips for using the XPath/XQuery Builder</head>
        <list>
          <item> The Xpath/XQuery builder is a useful tool for searching for unwanted stuff in the
            glossaries like brackets, slashes and so on. To open, go to Window &gt; Show View &gt;
            XPath/XQuery Builder </item>
          <item>For example to search for a bracket withing the glossary use the following code:
              <code>//gloss/term[@xml:lang = 'Bo-Ltn'][contains(text(), "(")]</code> The "(" at the
            end is what determines the bracket. Enter this into the XPath/XQuery Builder and press
            the play button to perform the search.</item>
          <item> To find an opening square bracket in the glossary use the following code:
              <code>//gloss/term[@xml:lang = 'Bo-Ltn'][contains(text(), "(") or contains(text(),
              "[")]</code>
          </item>
          <item> By using backslashes and element names you can also look for specific terms within
            particular elements, for example to search for a certain "word" within teh <gi>note</gi>
            elements, you could use this code: <code>//note[contains(data(), 'word')]</code> Here
            'word' is what you are looking for. <code>//</code> means search everywhere,
              <code>//note</code> means search everywhere for <gi>note</gi>s. </item>
          <item> You can save your search codes for later by clicking on the star icon. </item>

        <head>Guidelines for Updating Versions of the TEI Document</head>
        <p>To keep track of the versions within our published TEI documents we are currently 
        doing this by manually updating the version number within the <gi>edition</gi> element (found
        near the beginning of the <gi>teiHeader</gi> e.g. "v 1.01")</p>
        <p>Whenever you make changes to a published text change the version number. Also, when you
          start working on a text in markup BEFORE its been published use a version number. This way
          we can track the text, and especially have a way of knowing what version it is in case
          something goes wrong (which does happen from time to time). We do back up the database
          but it would be helpful to see the version number if we need to get a backed up file.</p>
        <p>So when you work on a text you can start it off as version 0.01. You don't need to increase
          it EVERY single time you save it since there will be many savings as you develop the text,
          but at least try to keep it moving (again, this is really just a backup so we know which
          file is the latest in case of emergency). At least start with that 0.01 so we know that
          it's a version in markup. Typically for smaller changes add .01, so V 1.07 becomes 1.08 and
          1.1 becomes 1.11. If there's a lot of changes or some more substantial changes add .1, so
          V 1.07 will become 1.1 and 1.1 becomes 1.2. And if there's a huge reworking of the text
          (mostly done by John or the translators) then increase by 1.0, so V 1.07 becomes V 2.0 and
          1.1 becomes 2.0. At some point, this will be automated but for now we should use this 
          system here.</p>
