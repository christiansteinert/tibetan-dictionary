                    <p tid="2">This large section of the Kangyur is also sometimes called <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mdo mang</title> (“the
                        many sūtras”) or <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mdo sna tshogs</title> (“miscellaneous sūtras”). In the Degé
                        Kangyur it contains 266 works, while in other Kangyurs the contents and their order vary somewhat. The
                        texts range in length from a few lines to more than 2,000 pages.</p>
                    <p tid="3">It is thought that many of these works circulated in Tibet, during the centuries preceding the evolution
                        and establishment of the different Kangyurs, in the form of varying compilations of sūtra works called
                            <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mdo mang</title>, some of which have survived.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC14668-2"/>
                    <p tid="4">According to the Degé Kangyur catalogue, the works in this section are arranged in two main divisions.
                        First come those identified as Mahāyāna sūtras (Toh 94-286), ending with a few short summaries and dedications.
                        Second come the Śrāvakayāna works (Toh 287-359), starting with the massive <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna</title> (Toh 287) spanning 
                        no less than four volumes. Despite this twofold arrangement in the Degé and other Kangyurs of the Tshalpa line,
                        however, not all Kangyurs and commentators agree on which texts should be assigned to these two broad 
                        groups. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC14668-8"/>
                    <p tid="0">Within these two divisions, too, there are several different organizing schema to be seen. Of the Mahāyāna works,
                        as Situ Paṇchen Chökyi Jungné, the 18th
                        century editor of the Degé Kangyur, observes, sūtras of the Buddha’s third turning of the wheel of Dharma
                        tend to predominate at first, but such categorizing is not always applicable and he himself, as he laid
                        out the Degé Kangyur, simply respected the precedent set by past scholars who arranged the texts of the
                        Tshalpa Kangyur. In some cases, sūtras are clearly grouped together because they are topically or historically 
                        related to each other, e.g. the three Parinirvāṇa sūtras (Toh 119–121), those on dependent arising (Toh 211–213), and 
                        the “Cloud” sūtras (Toh 231-235); or because of the way they were used, like the Mahāsūtras (Toh 288–294). 
                        Other significant grouping of sūtras appears to have been made on the basis of elements in their titles.
                        One obvious example is the grouping of three otherwise unrelated works that are all called 
                        “White Lotus” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">puṇḍarīka</foreign>, Toh 111–113); another is of those including the 
                        word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vyūha</foreign> (Toh 114–116). More often, the basis of grouping by title is that 
                        it gives some indication of genre, e.g. those called <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dharmaparyāya</foreign> (Toh 102–105), 
                        those including the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">samādhi</foreign> (Toh 127 and 129–137), those that indicate dialogues 
                        with or questioning by particular individuals (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">paripṛcchā</foreign>, Toh 148–174), those that 
                        include the term “teaching” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">nirdeśa</foreign>, Toh 175–187), “prophecy” 
                        (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vyākaraṇa</foreign>, Toh 188–193), and instructive narratives or “accounts” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">āvadāna</foreign>, 
                        Toh 343-349). Such groupings are nevertheless applied neither entirely exclusively,
                        nor fully inclusively. More broadly, the overall schema that results (whether in the Degé Kangyur or others in which the equivalent
                        sections are arranged in different order) is very different from the way the texts are grouped in the early 9th
                        century inventory, the Denkarma (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan kar ma</title>), and the slightly later
                        Pangthangma (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’phang thang ma</title>), both of which order the texts first by
                        vehicle and source language, and then place them in order of physical size, starting with the longest.</p>

                    <p tid="5">The sūtras in this General Sūtra section take many different forms. A large number of them relate dialogues
                        between the Buddha and individual disciples, whether bodhisattvas, kings, ordinary men and women, gods, or
                        nāgas. Some are teachings given by the Buddha at a particular occasion on particular topics. Sometimes
                        they relate miraculous manifestations, describe elevated states of <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">samādhi</foreign>, teachings given by buddhas in other realms, detailed lists of ethical or
                        philosophical points for reflection, summaries of important doctrine, explanations of individuals' past
                        lives or predictions of their future awakening, and so forth—often including several such elements in a
                        single work.</p>

                    <p tid="6">Among the best known large sūtras are the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhadrakalpika</title> (Toh 94), which
                        lists the names, vows, and other details of the thousand buddhas of the present eon; the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Lalitavistara</title> (Toh 95), the story of the Buddha's birth, youth, awakening,
                        and first teachings; two versions of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Laṅkāvatāra</title> (Toh 107 and 108,
                        from the Sanskrit and Chinese respectively); two of the three sūtras known as <title xml:lang="en">The White
                            Lotus</title>, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Karuṇāpuṇḍarīka</title> (Toh 112), and especially 
                        the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saddharmapuṇḍarīka</title> (Toh 113), often known as the “Lotus Sūtra,” which was highly
                        influential in China and Japan; and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Samādhirāja</title> (Toh 127).</p>

                    <p tid="7">The section contains two versions of the important <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra</foreign> (Toh 119 and 120), translated in the early period from Chinese and
                        Sanskrit respectively. The latter is only one quarter of the length of the former but represents those
                        parts of the sūtra of which fragments in Sanskrit have been found—perhaps an earlier, core version. There
                        is also a fragment (Toh 121) of a later translation by Kamalagupta and Rinchen Zangpo. The Narthang,
                        Lhasa, Stog Palace and Shelkar Kangyurs place the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra</foreign> in its own, separate division.</p>

                        duplicated as Toh 1061 and 1062 in the Incantations) form a special group with a particular function. They
                        are thought to have been brought to Tibet as part of the Vinaya transmission, and are listed in the
                        Denkarma separately from the other Śrāvakayāna works. They are probably extracted from the Āgamas of the
                        Mūlasarvāstivāda, and their regular recitation by ordained monks is recommended in the monks’ <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavibhaṅga</title> (Toh 3).
