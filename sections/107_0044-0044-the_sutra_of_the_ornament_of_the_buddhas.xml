                    <p tid="1">This very long work in 45 chapters fills no less than four volumes of the Degé Kangyur. In its current
                        form, it is presented as a single extensive sūtra (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">vaipulyasūtra</foreign>),
                        but it probably evolved as an encyclopedic coalescence of shorter works, many of which circulated
                        independently and are still seen as texts in their own right. The whole work is classified by Tibetan
                        editors as belonging to the Buddha’s third turning of the wheel of Dharma.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC11565-2"/>
                    <p tid="2">The early 9th century Tibetan translation is of similar size and content to the late 7th century Chinese
                        translation by Śikṣānanda, both being larger than the earlier Chinese translation by Buddhabhadra (early
                        5th century). Chinese translations of individual works that were later incorporated into the
                        Buddhāvataṃsaka were made even earlier (late 2nd to early 4th century), and may provide evidence of the
                        gradual evolution of the Buddhāvataṃsaka from its component parts. No version in any Indic language has
                        survived, and Indian treatises only quote some of its component texts rather than the whole work by the
                        name Buddhāvataṃsaka.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC11565-3"/>
                    <p tid="3">Tibetan historical tradition, however, as recounted by Tāranātha and mentioned briefly in the Degé Kangyur
                        catalogue, tells us that in India the collection not only existed but was originally a great deal larger,
                        with one hundred chapters (according to the Kangyur catalogue) or one thousand (Tāranātha), but is now
                        incomplete because an arson attack on the library at Nālandā reduced it to only thirty-eight surviving
                        chapters. The date of this event, said to have been responsible for the decimation of many other
                        scriptures, too (including much of the Ratnakūṭa), is placed some time before the lives of Asaṅga and
                        Vasubandhu, along with accounts of other calamitous episodes during a period of political turbulence and
                        unstable patronage for Buddhist institutions in India.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC11565-4"/>
                    <p tid="4">The Buddhāvataṃsaka was studied far more extensively in China than in Tibet, generating an extensive corpus
                        of commentarial literature, and a whole school of Chinese Buddhism, the Huayan, is based on it. Although
                        held in great esteem in Tibet, it was very little studied as a whole, and only a few of the later chapters
                        were widely known and quoted. It was translated into Tibetan in its entirety by Jinamitra, Surendrabodhi,
                        and Yeshé Dé, almost certainly from a Sanskrit original. The Tibetan translation contains two chapters, 11
                        and 32, not found in any of the Chinese translations.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC11565-5"/>
                    <p tid="5">According to Chinese tradition with its several versions, the whole work is divided into 34 or 39 chapters,
                        grouped into eight or nine “assemblies” according to the places and occasions where the teachings they
                        relate took place.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC11565-6"/>
                    <p tid="6">The way the text is divided into chapters is different in the Tibetan version. Several of the Kangyur
                        catalogues mention the first 29 chapters as constituting the Buddhāvataṃsaka proper, and add various
                        alternative titles for the work such as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sangs rgyas smag chad</foreign> (the
                        buddhas’ absence of darkness), <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">smad chad</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">rmad gcad</foreign> (universal containment), the latter being the form used in the
                        first line of each fascicle), as well as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">snyan gyi gong rgyan</foreign>
                        (ornaments for the ears) and <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">padma’i rgyan</foreign> (lotus ornaments).
                        Following both of the surviving early text inventories, the Pangthangma and Denkarma, they then name a
                        selection of the later chapters, leaving ambiguous their status as texts independent of the
                        Buddhāvataṃsaka itself or part of it. The text itself gives its component parts none of the trappings of
                        independent texts, such as Sanskrit titles or the usual opening phrases. However, as some of the later
                        chapters are known to have circulated independently in India as well as in China and Tibet, it is
                        reasonable to speak of the Buddhāvataṃsaka as a “family” of texts even if little is known of how and why
                        they came to be grouped together in this way.</p>

                        this name cited in several Indian treatises. It is listed as a separate text of the Buddhāvataṃsaka in the
                        Mahāvyutpatti, and a work in the Tengyur (Toh 3965) summarizes its contents.</p>
