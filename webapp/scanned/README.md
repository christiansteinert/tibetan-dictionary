# Python application for providing the rough page number in scanned Tibetan documents
## Introduction
This is a small application that providese the approximate page number of a Tibetan word in a scanned document. 

The program is written with the Flask framework and provides a REST endpoint that can be queried to ask where in a Tibetan document a term should occur according to the usual ordering scheme in modern Tibetan dictionaries.

The program works by using a list of head words which contains the fist word on each page. The expected page number of all other terms is interpolated by checking where a queried term fits alphabetically between the known head words.

This strikes a good balance between giving relatively quick access to printed dictionaries without having to index the page number of every single word in the dictionary.

## Huge thanks
Huge thanks go to Octave Boczkowski who came up with this wonderful idea. Furthermore, he meticulously indexed the head words of the dictionaries by JÃ¤schke and Chandra Das and created a [python implementation](https://github.com/julkamny/tibetan_jottings/) that was then converted into this little Flask application.

## Configuration
The configuration resides in the data/ subdirectory. It contains a JSON file that lists the known dictionaries. For each JSON file there needs to be a .txt file in a special format that lists the head word for each page.

More information about the format of these .txt files is contained at the beginning of these files themselves.

## Running this application 
### Testing
For testing purposes the application can be run by installing the python packages that are imported at the beginning of the code and then executing `python app.py`.

This will start a local test server at port 5000. 

The page information can then be queried by sending a GET request to `http://localhost:5000/<dictionary-name>/<tibetan-term-in-wylie-transliteration>` - for example `http://localhost:5000/jaeschke/ka` or `http://localhost:5000/das/sangs rgyas`.


### Production 
For running this application in production the recommended way is to use a web server with support for the python WSGI (Web Service Gateway Interface). 

One possibility is to use Apache and install mod_wsgi.

With mod_wsgi installed it is then enough to add the following line to your web site configuration `WSGIScriptAlias /<virtualPath> /<path-to-script>/app.py`.

## Relationship to the overall dictionary application
This python endpoint is called by the overall dictionary application to determine the page number of a term that is queried by a user. The overall dictionary application will then load the images for the corresponding pages from a separate path and display them within the overall dictionary application.
